"Ya had me in the first half there man, not gonna lie. My thumbs were ready to fly with Bronsexual rage lmao. But yeah, LeBron James wasn't just head and shoulder above the competition for MVP like Steph in 2016 and Giannis now, dude was head shoulders knees and toes over everybody."
"Every time I hear about unanimous MVPs I can't help but think back to how much better LeBron James was in 2012-13, yet still didn't get it. Steph 100% deserves it, and if Giannis gets it this year, he will have also deserved it assuming he keeps up this level of play. But Bron 100% deserved to be the first unanimous MVP that year."
"It's not that they're bad by any means, but any team is going to be weaker without LeBron James on the floor than with him. That's almost a ""sky's blue"" kind of thing. You can dare Rondo to shoot a little. For the Lakers' bigs, I don't know if there's an answer per se, but if you had to pick anyone in the league to guard them you already have that exact guy.    Still, I honestly don't think it looks like a good matchup even with all that. Mitchell would need to have a real hot streak, imo, to make it a series."
Yes. Somehow prevent LeBron James and Anthony Davis from joining the game. Easy win for the Jazz.
"So was Jordan.  So was Baylor,.  So was every single top 5 scorer except Lebron James. And even he is ball dominant."
"Tracy Mcgrady is pretty cool name, Also I'm from eastern europian country and I first heard name Lebron James when local TV announced he was selected number one by cleveland Cavaliers and I instantly knew this guy was going to be something special, same for dwyane wade, while Jalil okafor, Malik Monk and Jabari Parker have greatly dissapointed me.  Kawhi was also cool name I really liked but I would have been high on him regardless cause he was selected by Spurs."
Lebron James
"Don't forget to sign a mediocre big man to the Jerome James special off one playoff series, may I suggest Bismack ""I blocked LeBron once"" Biyombo for another monster contract this off-season"

Can we specifically trade for LeBron James in Flip-Flops(TM)?
"Sure, they just had an old dude named LeBron James"
"That's what Rick Barry said about a young LeBron James, something like...if he figures out how to shoot they'll have to outlaw him from the league"
"LeBron ""Jaxson Hayes"" James"
Derozan is just MJ without god tier athleticism ( and Phil Jackson)    Shaq is just Giannis without lateral quickness   KG is just Draymond without average athleticism (but instead God tier athleticism)     Embiid is just Tim Duncan without an elite postgame and worse health    Lebron is just Oscar Robertson but bigger    Luka Doncic is James Harden but less black (kinda)     Kobe Bryant is Jesus Christ (but less hype)    Zion is just Charles Barkley but THICCER
"I dunno I'm in New Zealand and in terms of general media attention the NBA receives next to nothing, yet pretty much everyone here could tell you who LeBron James or Steph Curry is, and to a lesser extent Russ and KD due to the Adams connection. You'd be hard pressed to get those same people to name an NHL team let alone any players."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
You gotta remember where he's coming from. Literally the ONLY thing good Cleveland had in the entire history of the state is Lebron James so I can understand why guy gets all moist for Bron  I understand 206Buckeye..... I understand
"Jimmy garrapolo is Draymond green, Aaron Rodgers is LeBron James"
"Can you explain how stating that a player wasn't an all star level player is hating or minimising?  All I said was that being a significantly worse Lamar Odom means you're a really bad player, as opposed to being a worse LeBron James where there's still room to be decent"
Lebron James joins the ranks of notable rising stars snubs along with Jaxson Hayes and Matisse Thybulle
"bro in no way shape or form do lebron james and mike scott have anything in common. especially not 19/20 scott. one is a top 5 player of all time, a ball dominant hyper athletic slasher while being one of the best passers the game has even seen.   ..the other one is a dude who holds onto the remains of his hairline for dear life  just kidding, but no, mike scott is an undersized Stretch 4 who somehow forgot how to shoot, so he is basically hot garbage..6'7 for nothing really lol"
I've always believed that Mike Scott is a (very) poor man's LeBron James.  Same with Rudy Gay.
"Jimmy Butler, Lebron James, Blake Griffin aren't elite in wingspan."
"You literally made an argumentative comment on something that doesn't concern me. I am not American, if I was I'd be ashamed over my country bombing countries into the stone age for example. But I am not, so don't lecture me about things that I have nothing to do with?!   So how about this: You shut the fuck up and become more approving of my justified criticism of Chinas escort Lebron James. You don't get to tell me shit about being critical because I am critical enough.    All in all quit fucking dickriding Lebron"
"Yeah most of the NBA fanbase can't see what's happening in real time it seems, as your opinion isn't uncommon. (this sounds arrogant but i'm not going to edit because i already posted. just wanted to say i didn't mean to be. it's just my opinion, i just meant many people seem to feel that the older generation was just as good)  The players in today's game are just on another level from people who are considered ""great"" from past decades. Jordan's certainly a name that hasn't and won't be forgotten, but most of the NBA legends are pretty terrible at basketball in comparison to modern NBA stars. In comparison to their own era, they stood out more, but they are simply not as good with a basketball as today's players.  We don't have three great teams playing each other, and tennis rarely had that either. At most times during the past two decades, one or more of the big 3 were injured or recovering and off of top tier tennis. During a similar time period, we've seen the greatest Dynasty in NBA history (Spurs), the best team in NBA history (Warriors+KD), and one of the GOAT's, if not THE GOAT in LeBron James.  We can look at it differently, no worries, but I'm certain that in 20 years you'll look back and see I was right."
"Hayward, Al, IT, Kemba, Brown, and the countless other players around the league that praise the Celtics when asked about them  Edit of course it's a Laker fan. Never forget. Lebron James garage door in LA was spray painted with racial slurs so pipe down"
"Yes he did, why do you need to lie?  &gt; I want kids in Northeast Ohio, like the hundreds of Akron third-graders I sponsor through my foundation, to realize that there’s no better place to grow up.   https://www.si.com/.amp/nba/2014/07/11/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers"
"lebron james has a wagon, he could play sf"
"LeBron James stats against Boston:  15p, 13a, 7r  Philly:  29/8/7  Clippers:  20/9/9  Raptors:  13/15/13  Bucks:  21/11/12  Miami:   26/9/6  These are not atrocious statlines. And these are the best wing defending teams in the league. His efficiency could be much better against Toronto and the Clippers, but again, these are the best wing defending teams in the league."
"I'm a little surprised he's wound up being a bust as a coach. His pedigree to move into that role could hardly have been any better. To start with, he's NBA royalty, he was lauded his college and playing career as an X's and O's fundamentals guy, played with prime Kobe, mentored by Phil Jackson, goes on to assist one of the best teams in NBA history, returns to the Lakers amidst an interesting junction of promising young talent that seems perfect for a young coach to develop. He doesn't have a bad reputation and appears well liked by players in general(although this may be an issue, if they thought of him more as a peer and less as a coach, I suppose). They get friggin Lebron James. And they still miss the playoffs.   Don't know if there's anything to take away from that other than he just doesn't have 'it'. But I guess coaching is a very long career path, who knows, maybe he'll bounce around for a while and eventually figure something out."
It actually should have. Lebron has posted racist stuff against Jews. Michael Jordan despite his wealth does not tip.  Sources   Lebron  https://m.jpost.com/International/LeBron-James-under-fire-after-posting-tenuously-antisemitic-lyrics-to-Instagram-575228   Jordan  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2010/09/08/wayne-gretzky-once-called-out-michael-jordan-for-undertipping/  https://www.tmz.com/2014/04/04/charles-barkley-michael-jordan-cheapskate-homeless-scottie-pippen/
"&gt;No, none of LeBron's minutes are at the PG. Zero. None. Zilch   Basketball reference play-by-play disagrees.  &gt;He is playing next to 2 SGs. Is avery Bradley playing the SF position? No   15% of his time is at the SF position which LeBron plays at only 9%.  &gt;The Lakers do not play a PG. At all. No one has spent any minutes at the PG spot. They have either Danny green or Avery Bradley at the 1. That's it.   They do and his name is LeBron James.  &gt;You don't have to play a PG man. LeBron is a point forward. You cannot be a guard if you are a forward  LeBron isn't a forward this season he's a PG.  And Danny Green spends 86% of his time as a SF."
"He has missed those shots before and he will again in the future.   You should never hate on greatness and in very few cases can I think it happens. Disliking a person is one thing, but discrediting lebron James from coming 3-1 down or any of the historic stuff he has done because “he subjects himself to criticism” by some of the questionable career moves he has made. You can compare it against other great things and say why you would pick one over the other, but you can’t say well it’s not that good because it’s lebron James.  It’s historic for a reason.   That’s the point that was made about Harden earlier. Harden wasnt getting the love for doing the stuff he has been doing because it’s Harden. No one is saying don’t love Lillard for what he’s doing, no one is saying Harden was better. Just saying James harden should’ve got credit like this.   It’s not, “what about Harden”. Because no one is doing what Harden is doing or did. The news is about him, not people coming in saying oh Harden did this.   Other superstars get the same treatment, like Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony (back in the day) etc . But you chuck someone who is loved like let’s say SGA because I haven’t seen any negative comments on him, he does this stuff in the future and everyone would froth. No one is crying about it, it’s just more like come on guys let’s start appreciating this greatness, especially our (rockets) own fans  Edit: I can’t believe I spent so much time on that, I apologise to myself, you and everyone who wasted their time over some opinion that means nothing."

"Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid 76ers. That team is better than any team LeBron ever beat in the East.  &gt;and that heat team has LeBron James  And that Raptors team has Kawhi Leonard?"
That raptors team got taken to 7 games by the... Jimmy Butler sixers?   Oh and that heat team has LeBron James.
"I mean, those are both pretty straw man examples. Someone thinking Sabonis shouldn't be an All-Star is a far cry from thinking LeBron James isn't a good basketball player. The point is that gatekeeping/no true Scotsman arguments are used far too often when describing fairly reasonable differences of opinion."

"Lebron James, like Magic Johnson, makes his teammates better.   Kobe’s offensive skillset is top 3 all time."
LeBron James  **3.5**   John Stockton  **2.8**   Jason Kidd  **2.9**    Isiah Thomas **3.8**  Magic Johnson **3.9**   Steve Nash **2.9**   Larry Bird **3.1**   According to your logic magic would be the worst passer on that list
"Kobe Bryant, the most recently retired top 10 player of all time. The only one that's on that level who has recently retired or active is LeBron James and Tim Duncan. Maybe Dirk and Wade."
"Not when he performed below expectations in the playoffs. He got criticized a ton after the 2013 semifinals exit to Memphis when he shot 20% in a closeout game and was terrible in clutch.   If you remember, the narrative around that playoff run after Westbrook got injured was that Durant would be unchained from his selfish ball hog PG and put up crazy scoring numbers. Well he did that against the Rockets. But Tony Allen and Marc drowned that hype and KD got heat for it from the media.  Also remember that LeBron James had and still does have an army of stans who will push back on any player being crowned a king before proving such in the postseason. They didn't take kindly to all the talk of Durant being better and used his playoff exits as reason that he wasn't better."
"This will be your starting 5 next year  Dame CJ Ariza Collins/Melo (we'll see how that works out) Nurk  I think that's a damn good starting 5. Since the acquisition of Ariza he has been an incredible d and 3 player that has completely changed the team. Having that reliable shooting has been incredible and the elite defense has given us someone to throw at the LeBron James' of the world to slow them down a bit. Ariza gives us what we never had in Mo, Aminu or Layman, someone who is consistent on both sides of the ball.   We don't need to add another Superstar if nurk comes back to pre nurk 11 form he's the 3rd star. ""Swinging big"" and getting thj, maxi and a late first isn't exactly making the team better now or in the future. I like maxi and think he's the best asset in the trade (why Mavs wouldn't do the trade, he's on a Covington/Crowder type tradable contract) but he's a bench player when nurk gets back and thj can be a flame thrower but it doesn't put us over any edge with a heavy contact. And I'm not sure Portland is looking for another first in a weak draft when be they'll already have one that'll be higher than the Mavs pick.  Collins, hopefully comes back and continues his trajectory. Simons makes the leap. Trent continues to grow confidence and Naz continues improving and we replace Mario with anyone there's something there and I haven't even mentioned Hood yet. I know it's hard to see the forest through the trees, but there's still optimism in this team."
"LeBron ""Lonzo Ball"" James"
lebron james
Laker formula for success is simple: LeBron James
"Hey man, no one was talking about Kobe vs MJ 1 on 1 literally. The conversation is about who’s the the best clutch shot maker of all time. Who would win 1 on 1 is a totally different topic. Nothing I said had anything to do with Kobe playing against Jordan. The point I made was completely about who’s the most clutch shot maker of all time.    https://fadeawayworld.net/2019/02/23/interesting-statistic-about-michael-jordan-lebron-james-and-kobe-bryant-in-clutch-playoff-moments/"
Do people think this is DeAndre Jordan or LeBron James. LeBron has more than enough of a skill set to make it competitive off the dribble       Guarding one of the most athletic NBA players of all time is no easy feat even for a first team a defensive player
You can be great at playmaking and still be worse than LeBron James
Yep I’m the same. But a lot of people on here are more interested in Lebron James memes than Lebron James stats from last night.
"For me, it would mark the definitive end of LeBron being the best player in the NBA. People have had arguments for Steph, KD, Kawhi over the past few years, but I don't feel like any of them have definitively knocked James off his throne. Giannis winning back to back MVPs and winning the chip, possibly over LeBron, would do it."
"You're not reading, his performance in 'that' game is bad for the first 3 quarters,and the last minutes of the 4th.   Eitherway,  Hyperfocus in Game 6(4th quarter),constantly mention game 7(but claim it's not even needed) while ignoring Game 1-5 and Game 6(1st three quarters+4th Quarter Last 5/1 min).   PS:  Game 6   11/26 (32) Points  Lebron James(11 Ast/10 Reb) (42.3 FG%)(51.2 TS%)(6 turnovers)(2 in last minute)    13/21 (30) points  Tim Duncan(17 rebounds) (61.9 FG%)(64.7 TS%)  His stats weren't otherworldly in spite of his amazing 4th quarter overall.I wonder what they means of his 'overall' performance for game 6."
What a load of nonsense. Harden has done way more and led teams to 50+ wins and would have a title right if now if not facing the most dominant team since the Bulls. Davis hasn't done a damn thing in this league until he played second fiddle to LeBron James. Wild disrespectful
"I’m not sure this argument supports you. If someone didn’t think lebron james was good, and doesn’t watch basketball, there’s no basis for for arguing about how good a player is at all. Therefore, watching basketball doesn’t inherently convey anything about if a player is good or not. All it tells you is if they watch basketball or not."
"If someone didn’t think LeBron James was good, would you consider them someone who knows anything about basketball?  Now if someone told Andre Drummond was a first team All NBA level player, would you consider them someone who knows anything about basketball?  Those examples are obviously more extreme, but there is certainly a gate to being someone who knows something about the NBA. You may not agree a person’s view on Sabonis is the proper gate, but I don’t think you can argue there is no gate to keep."
"It's really not, the narrative has changed a lot over the last couple of years, but at the time of the all star voting the Celtics were 2nd in defensive rating in the NBA.   Here are a handful of articles describing the DPOY Race around midseason: [1](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/01/19/nba-midseason-awards-lebron-james-james-harden-mvp-race)  5 out of SI's 6 writers picked Al Horford.

RIP Lebron James. He was my favourite soccer player! I'm so sad he died in the car crash.
"Stop with thev excuses.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2816064-rich-paul-lebron-james-groin-injury-carries-6-week-timeline-wont-rush-back In the article I'm linking Rich Paul, LeBron's agent who has a incredible bias for LeBron even said it was a 3 to 6 week injury and they didn't give a shit about nobody else and LeBron wasn't coming back until he was healthy. LeBron took the full 6 weeks and came back and knew all eyes would be on him and still went out of his way to say he was ""activated"". LeBron still looks like he is running in peanut butter, that's his age not the injury. Again stop with the excuses. Next thing you know I'm going to be hearing that LeBron punching that whiteboard was still bothering him. You Stan's are hilarious"
"He said he was upset the Dantoni made those comments while players were still in China cause he didn’t think of what could happen to them. Y’all wanna hate cause you’re children I get it, but LeBron James is the best role model in basketball and has been since he got to the league."
Because he’s not LeBron james
"He means well when it helps Lebron's bottom line. He has a different standard than other athletes. He needs to start acting like he understands that.   I said ""I just don't like Lebron"" to start this whole thread. And I mean it. I do not like Lebron James. Zero respect for him as a communicator or moral leader- which I only judge him on because that's how he WANTS to be judged.  All of this plays into that narrative. And I will call him out."
I came here to say Lebron James and you just fucking DUNKED on everybody in here I’m going home
"Without Lebron it would be James Worthy. So still an amazing team, some spacing issues maybe but they would probably just fast break every time or dump it to shaq or Kareem"
"Nobody is judging based on assumptions or false information . The way he acted in Cleveland Boston and now omg he nets calling out his teammates meanwhile he missed 20+ games and he complains about their play and they made the playoffs without him yet here you are defending his little to no honor . Get real man . I’m not gonna defend someone who thinks only about himself and throws others under the bus as he did with Lebron James , All the Boston Celtics players  and now the nets so again not judging or saying anything that’s wrong just stating the facts we know already no lies or made up assumptions over here"
Chicago Bulls have been in existence for 54 years and have had 41 years without Michael Jordan. In those 41 years they have zero titles and zero Finals appearances. With Jordan they have 6 Titles   The Cleveland Cavaliers have been in existence for 50 years and have 39 years without LeBron James. In those 39 years they have zero titles and zero Final appearances. With LeBron they have 1 title.  Is it just coincidence that the Bulls front office couldn't win anything before or after Jordan but miraculously became some powerhouse front office in only the time Jordan was there?
"Peking James having the gall to utter the name of an American legend like Kobe has me feeling a couple different ways.  In one sense, LeBron opened his life up to the sport of basketball and devoted himself to the craft in order to be among the best of the best. That's something to be admired, and his respect for Kobe is clearly apparent.  However, I still feel the sting of betrayal from what he said shortly following BlizzardGate or WinniePoohGate or whatever the Internet is calling it these days, that is if the hive mind hasn't forgotten."
"Always been and always will be, Lebron James"
Lebron loves China. Fuck lebron james for real
"Imo AD is not better. AD had to leave NO because he couldn't handle leading a team and being the #1 guy. He had to team up with LeBron so he could be in his more natural position as a #2. This actually is a point I heard from the ESPN postgame analysts (former players)  after tonight's Blazers - Lakers game.  For Harden, he is obviously incredible, but he's not better imo. First, right now Harden is a less efficient scorer than Damian is and only scores more because of the shot chucking offense he plays in. Also, even though Damian gets more assists than Harden, Harden turns the ball over a significantly higher clip of 4.6TO compared to 2.9TO for Damian. James Harden  on average will make more bad, low IQ plays in a game than Damian does. Also from the anecdotal evidence of just watching them play Damian comes off as the more talented and skilled player. Damian shooting 45% from 33ft and beyond makes him lethal in a way other players just aren't.  Of course this is just my opinion and all this stuff is subjective, but I do think I make a pretty good case."

Lebron James
does he really think Lebron James is skipping NBA games to go watch his kid play?
"I remember that. Laker fans last year thought they'd be able to get Jerry West back before Clippers extended his contract, they thought they'd get Doc Rivers, saying it'd be dumb of him to turn down the ability to coach Lebron James, they thought they'd get Kawhi Leonard."
Thank god for LeBron James.
"Does anyone else feel there isn’t another better suited person on this earth to give this memorial? Seriously, the amount of pressure Lebron James has had on him is unimaginable. And he steps up to the plate and exceeds expectations every time."
"God, I just really wish LeBron or AD would have just gone off. I don’t feel the Lakers have anything like that, and if the unit goes cold, no one can really save them. I think James is past his super carry phase."

"He always has been, anyone who said he wasn’t isn’t a fan of the Lakers. Part of the reason we are the Lakers is because guys like Lebron fucking James want to be here. I fucking love anyone who wants to don the purple and gold and rep Los Angeles."
Did y'all really think someone else wrote notes for him? If anything they were empty or wrote them himself or a write he chose.   He's Lebron James not your high school valedictorian
"Lebron James as the captain of the Lakers, giving a speech in memoriam after the death of Kobe.  Time is the craziest, most surprising, sneaky, unstoppable thing in the world. Peaking into the future and reading this in 2018 would just be unfathomable."
"I can’t believe how incredible privileged I’ve been as a lifelong Angeleno and Laker fan. To have witnessed the entire career and life of Kobe Bryant, and now in this moment of grief to have LeBron James to shoulder our burden and lead this team, I’m truly grateful."
How can anyone not love LeBron James.  What a guy.  I'm crying all over again but that was beautiful.

Dag.... from here on out I'm not even gonna be mad at Lebron for not coming here to the Sixers anymore  I think the Universe led him to the Lakers probably JUST for this very reason... can't imagine any one else that would have been better for this right now than Lebron James (face of the NBA)

"The problem with your post isn't that it isn't true, it's that Kyrie is the only source of blame. I don't know if you've heard, but Lebron James is a mighty big headache for a lot of organizations. Him bringing a lot of revenue and wins to an organization doesn't change that. Even last year in Boston, I saw multiple issues, only one of them was Kyrie. Multiple people in the Celtics organization confirmed what I saaw. However, because he is the 'Chosen One' in terms of sports villains, people are quick and eager to put everything on Kyrie. Kyrie is faaaaar from blameless, but him leaving Lebron thrusted him into space that made him very unlikable, and leaving Boston catapulted him to super-villain status. You can be a super-villain and still not be responsible for all the ills on your team. That's just lazy thinking."
"Before these past two years, Hawks have made the playoffs for literally a decade straight. Who’s talking recent irrelevance as a 6er fan haha.

"Never forget this all time great Ky and Lue interaction in Cleveland:   During a rare practice in the middle of last season, coach Tyronn Lue, who was standing next to assistant coach and Irving confidant Phil Handy, called out to his young point guard.  ""Ky,"" Lue said, ""I want you to play a little faster.""  ""Why?"" Irving asked.  ""Because if we play faster, we get shots off easier.""  ""I don't need to play faster to get my shot off,"" Irving replied. ""I can do that anytime.""  ""I'm not talking about your shot. I'm talking about RJ and JR,"" Lue said, citing teammates Richard Jefferson and Smith.  ""Well, that's No. 23's job,"" Irving replied, referring to James.  According to members of the Cavs organization who witnessed the exchange, Lue ended the conversation by walking away, shaking his head.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21941260/nba-playing-lebron-winning-nba-title-kyrie-irving-decided-move-question-why     I’m sure Lue can’t wait for part 2 with Ky lmao"
"Yep, as /u/KevinOConnor says:  *”Do Not Take LeBron James for Granted”...*"
"&gt; Lue led the cavs to historic playoff offenses the likes that we have never seen before.  This is true and an understated point. r/nba is incredibly inconsistent when it comes to giving credit for coaching. That said, it is Lebron James we're talking about."

It's not the truth. Lebron James is the best basketball player in the world and has been for a decade.
"Pat Riley himself: https://heatnation.com/media/pat-riley-reveals-lebron-james-wanted-erik-spoelstra-fired-2010/  David Blatt has multiple sclerosis: https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/cavaliers/2019/08/19/david-blatt-multiple-sclerosis-cleveland-cavaliers-olympiakos/2051701001/ And retired from coaching a few months after revealing his condition: https://www.si.com/nba/2019/12/18/david-blatt-retirement-coaching-new-york-knicks-front-office-hire  And no one on the lakers outside of Lebron has been particularly good the couple years before this one. Walton did great in his stint with the warriors (but who tf wouldnt), did poorly with the lakers, started the year poorly with the kings and has them playing well right now. Even though he’s got a few years experience I can’t confidently say yet whether he’s a good or bad head coach. But I don’t disagree at all with the lakers firing him, it’s worked out extremely well."

Completely different data in the article above."
Giannis struggles in crunch time. He doesn't have that next level gear guys like LeBron and kawhi have. He'll be stuck in the James Harden tier unless he rapidly improves.
That would mean James Jones is the GOAT. The reason Lebron won most of his rings.
"Lol obviously a team of derozen and LA isnt contending. But what seperates champions from ""contenders"" is culture or a GOAT. I can't think of any team in the past 20 years that won a chip without great culture or LeBron James."
"The Rockets were the 4th seed while being tied with the 3rd, 1 game behind the 2nd, and 4 games behind the 1st, all while have a ton of injuries to everyone outside of Harden.  Chris Paul missed 24 games, Gordon missed 14 games, and Capela missed 15 games.  The only consistent piece was James Harden.  Anthony Davis has missed 5 games this season.  Imagine him only playing 5 more this season?  That's what Harden got with Cp3 as a #2.  If that actually happened, it's not crazy to think the Lakers would stumble a bit.   So that's just team stuff.  On top of that, James Harden had a legitimately *unreal* season.  He averaged **36**/6.6/7.5/2 on 61% TS.  Tbh, I hate the guy and hate watching him play, but what he did was unreal.  36 points per game is insane.  He absolutely had a better case than LeBron does this year, and IMO, it's not particularly close.  There is a reason why people strongly felt he was snubbed last year."

"Dudley was a playoff starter last year, but he's like the 13th man on our roster. He could definitely contribute, but I also think it's hard to justify playing him over our current SF/PF rotation of Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Kyle Kuzma, and Markieff Morris. It's less that he's undeserving, and more that our bench is significantly deeper than the media or /r/nba has given it credit for throughout the season."

"LeBron James says something stupid, more news at 11"
"Nice, way to try to discredit me by pretending I’m a kid. Nah. I’ve watched the nba going on 3 decades. maybe I’ve watched the most freakish 15+ year career and have never seen anybody who encompasses everything it takes to be an elite athlete like lebron james."
Why are you surprised Lebron James said something dumb? He’s not exactly a genius and says stupid things quite often.
"Paul Pierce was stabbed 11 times and then played all 82 games that year.  Paul Pierce played through injury through much of his career. He played through injury, in his late 30s, still authoring clutch playoff moments, for the *Washington Wizards.*  He didn't take LeBron style flops and then whine at refs; he would stand pat in the charge circle to stop a sure bucket and hopefully maybe get a bad call. Then he would talk shit to the player who was whining to the ref about how it should have been a block, clapping in his face.   Paul Pierce rose above his talent level through sheer will. Shaquille O'Neal praised Pierce more than any perimeter player he ever played with or against until Dwyane Wade, and anointed him the ""Motherfucking Truth"" on live television after Pierce destroyed the Lakers again.   PP routinely outdueled TMac, AI, Kobe, players with more athleticism or talent or hype. When Pierce finally got a *squad* with smart team building with the Ray and KG trades, they broke prime LeBron James in multiple playoff series, and the Celtics indirectly started the inorganic definitite collusion superteam concept.   Except in tank years, Pierce guarded the best perimeter player for much of the game when most stars loafed or took a weaker assignment to save energy.   Paul grinded out more career points than softer but infinitely more talented players like Carmelo.   You are blind, nephew. You're confusing irritating behavior to get under oppenents skin as a lack of toughness. Do you think Kobe isn't tough because he was jealous of Shaq, or because he tried to get traded twice? Pierce never *threw a fucking playoff game* like Kobe did against the Suns.   Pierce wasn't nearly as talented as Kobe, but had superior Mamba Mentality. I hope that irritates you as much as Pierce irritated the league for 20 years. Pierce is the human equivalent of the Sam Cassell big balls celebration."

"TORONTO, On (AP) -- LeBron James has dedicated a basketball court at the school he founded for underprivileged children in his hometown.  Joined by his close friends and former teammates from nearby St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, James helped unveil a multicolored outdoor court at the I Promise School, which has just started its second academic year and now serves more than 300 students from grades 3-5. The NBA superstar is spending more than $1 million on various upgrades for the school. James and his high school buddies played a few of the kids in a quick game, and the four-time MVP dunked to break in one of the hoops. The 34-year-old will soon begin his second season with the Los Angeles Lakers. He missed the playoffs last season, failing to make the Finals for the first time in nine years. James has a starring role in “Space Jam 2,” which has been filming in Hollywood this summer.  He has also dedicated a court recently to abused children in the Toronto Area and construction has just been completed. [Court of the North](https://images.app.goo.gl/XQBJgJVQYKLfjRzv8)"

MICHAEL JEFFERY JORDAN WOULD NEVER HAVE SAVED STEPH CURRY'S LEGACY LIKE LEBRON JAMES DID
"Who is perpetuating the idea that LeBron is underrated? Nobody is overlooking LeBron James, everyone knows the Lakers are one the favorites to win a ring this year. Almost everyone expects them to at least get to the conference finals. Just because he’s not winning the mvp this year doesn’t mean he’s being slept on."
LeBron James is still the best player in the league.
Until LeBron James starts losing consistently in the playoffs he still the fucking king.
Lebron James is very good at basketball.
this might be the only one that beats LeBron James Harden. Imagine a fucking center with Bill's size and basketball IQ with Russ's athleticism and motor. It'd be like a Wilt Chamberlain that tried his hardest.
"LeBron James Jones would be enough, let alone Bron James Harden"
Just in Lebron James doesn’t care about NBA fans
ESPN: Lebron James WANTS fans to get Coronavirus
"They play them less though. And one of the Bucks wins vs the Clippers was without PG and Kawhi. Let's see:  1-1 vs Lakers, 2-0 vs Clippers, 0-1 vs Denver, 1-1 vs Utah, 1-0 against Houston. That's a 4-3 record.  The Lakers are 0-2 vs Clippers, 2-1 vs Denver, 2-0 vs Utah, 1-1 vs Houston. That's a 4-4 record. And the loss to Denver was without Lebron James..."
LeBron James Harden by a landslide.
LeBron James Harden would insane  D’Angelo Russell Westbrook would be fun to watch
"I mean we lost by 7 on the back end of a 4 games in 5 nights road trip and Lebron dealing with a minor groin issue. This was as showcase game with both teams at full strength and decent rest and imo, the better team one cause that team has Lebron James."
Stop living in denial and just admit it.    LeBron James is the greatest of all time.
Lebron James any year of their careers any time.

LeBron James is still the baddest mother fucker on the basketball court.

"Adam Silver wonder why the league losing money, that’s why, people pay good money to watch athletes play, and LeBron James takes over the fucking game lol"
"Great game by the lakers, they played hard D and abused the bucks with that James pick &amp; roll with McGee/Howard. Lebron as usual, shows up in big games. On another note, if AD plays like this in the playoffs then Lakers are in a bad luck, dude came with zero energy, lazy defense, bad shots. He Played great in the 4th quarter but he needs to bring that energy earlier in the game."
"It happens every year but we never learn. LeBron James is the best player in the world. When he starts coasting we think he's declining, but then he comes out and shows everyone who the best still is."

LeBron James is 35 years old.
Lebron James is one of the greatest players of all time.
#LeBRON JAMES
"He'd be 1a/b with Anthony Davis as a power forward/center hybrid. He'd easily be the best offensive bigman, KAT coming close behind, and prime Dirk would be average on defense. Not great and would get burned in the PnR but still serviceable and would average 30+ in this era's offense. He peaked at 27PPG in a much much slower era with only 1-2 3PTA per game.   I think he'd be top 5, comfortably behind LeBron James and Giannis."
Lebron James the IV
&gt; Lebron James is running on the end of his biological clock.  He's not menopausal
"After reading some stats, it isn’t the lowest viewed pro sport. But, it is still struggling with viewership and seeing large dips.   Watching James harden flop like this, and watching Lebron get poked in the eye and cry about it doesn’t make for entertaining sporting events"
"The fact that he is only 5' 7"" and debatably the greatest soccer player in the world. I can never relate to a Lebron James super there, but a guy that is an inch shorter than me? Fuck yeah"
"Honestly he should be very close to if not ahead of LeBron for me.  I always wonder if Ray Allen doesn’t make that 3 would Duncan get his props as the greatest of that era - personally I doubt it, given the hype machine behind James since he was in high school.  There is definitely definitely an argument as to whether a 3-6 finals record is as or more impress5-1 record"
"Not everything revolves around Kobe. Lebron said that in the moment. He’s gonna do whatever he wants to do, he’s lebron James."
"Lol Jordan was 6-0 in the finals 6 Finals Mvp.  Plus 10 scoring titles and 9 time all nba 1st team defense.  Won DPOY and has 5 Mvp's   Lebron James. 3-5 in the finals. 3 Finals Mvp. 1 scoring title and 5 time all nba 1st team  Never won DPOY and has 4 Mvps's  Even with the rings and awards he'd havd 6 finals win likes Jordan, 1 less finals mvp and less defensive accolades.  Jordan goat 🐐  Lebron too little too late"
"Speaking of Shaq, what if Portland never trades Brian Grant to Miami in the 2000 offseason? If that doesn’t happen, who joins Caron Butler and Lamar Odom in the package that sends him from Los Angeles to Miami on July 14, 2004, the summer after Detroit doesn’t win the title? Does this trade happen if Los Angeles wins the 2004 title? What if Los Angeles has just finished running off titles starting in 2001 and ending in 2004? What is the ensuing impact on San Antonio, Miami, Boston and Cleveland? Who does LeBron James score 25 straight points against if not the Pistons? Who are his rivals to defeat in claiming the Eastern Conference throne?  Without ‘Sheed in Detroit and Jermaine O’Neal in Indiana, could the Nets — this time with Vince Carter in tow — have made a third straight trip to the NBA Finals in 2004? While a Vince Carter versus Kobe Bryant matchup would have offered plenty of entertainment,"
"If Rose didn’t get injured, Kobe and Tim retired five years early, and Lebron James chose football, y’all couldve had a ring*  *FTFY"
No he really wasn't. There was major concern about his injury and the 1st round pick was the only guarantee  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2763779-rumor-isaiah-thomas-injury-had-lebron-james-unimpressed-with-kyrie-irving-trade

"Of course it was. The nba playoffs are 7 game series. No one gives two fucks about the first round to. Football is a 16 game season, so every game matters. Playoffs are single elimination as well.  Basketball is more popular then football, especially to younger kids. More people are interested in the NBA then the NFL. Just look at American culture, players like LeBron James, curry, KD are much more relevant then any NFL player. Just go to social media and compare the NBA followers to the NFL’s"

Ricky Davis was under the impression that Lebron was going to be brought in to be his backup. Lebron got blocked by Nate Robinson. Ricky Davis got a goal tend instead. Ergo Ricky Davis is better than Lebron James. /s
LeBron James for the 2018 run alone. That team was almost total dick against Indiana and Boston

"You. Know. Gravity and shit is different up there right? Like I think teams in Latin America is a huge stretch. But you are talking about playing games either at the International Space Station or Mars. But yes. My predictions. Eventually we will have clones of some of the greatest players come back and play in the nba. So we will have (Clone) Wilt Chamberlin playing with (Clone) Kobe Bryant (RIP) Against LeBron James (age 63, still putting up 18, 6 and 6) and LeBron James III."
He didn't have a good argument at all outside being LeBron James. His statline was almost identical to Wade....his teammate. They had 24/11 PF from the previous year as their third option. This team won less regular season games in the same conference as the Bulls. Where do you even begin to make an argument for LeBron? Dwight was the one who had a real case in 2011.
"Tell that to James Harden. Lebron only has 3 championships in his whole career and he was the best player in the league for 15 years and had to basically team up in what was seen as a scummy way back then to get the first 2. Giannis isn’t a Lebron level player, everything has to line up to win a title even as a star. James Harden has put up mvp caliber seasons 5 of the last 6 seasons and it’s looking like he’ll never win."
"Yes, LeBron James is absurdly good at basketball and was able to exploit a mismatch. I’m still taking a Steph type player over a player who, although is extremely good, has a very limited ceiling and hasn’t even attempted to improve on it.   You say Steph was abused in the finals. Cool. If you replace Steph with a Simmons type player they wouldn’t have made the finals in the first place. And if they did his inability to shoot beyond 3 feet would be exploited as well."
"When you have to compete with lebron James for being the best at your position you’re in pretty good fucking company. No shit he’s not better than lebron, that’s not an argument for him to not be considered better than curry lmfao"
"The cavs supporting cast outside of kyrie and lebron could not create offense for shit. Every time lebron sat the warriors went on a run. Pj tucker played better than love did in any series vs gs. I don’t get how u think the supporting casts were washes, how do you think rockets actually closed out games and got the series to 7 vs gs unlike the cavs? They actually were able to get stops when necessary unlike the cavs. James harden and cp3 actually had a horrible game 5 and the rockets somehow won. Cause their supporting cast actually stepped up."
"&gt; multiple great players (Duncan, Kawhi, Parker, Ginobili)  Duncan was great, but a bit past his prime. Kawhi was very good, but a bit before his prime. And Parker and Ginobili, while being very good players, don't really match up to the list of all-time greats. Neither was ever even close to being the best player in the league in their era.  &gt; went 16-7 in the playoffs  There are literally dozens of teams that have had better playoff runs. The 71-72 Lakers went 12-3 in theirs.  &gt; had the most dominate finals performance of all time against a Lebron James led team  This is just silly; absolute nonsense of a take. Hell, it wasn't even the most dominant finals Spurs performance against a LeBron led team; that was in 2007. And did you forget 2017 and 2018 when the overloaded Warriors smoked the Cavs?  2014 Spurs were a damn good team. But I'd take (like a lot of other fans) the 71-72 Lakers over them for good reason."
&gt; Curry has an argument for GOAT PG  No he doesn’t   &gt; KD has arguably NEVER been the best at his own position  One has to compete with LeBron fucking James and now Kawhi. The other competes with Dame Lillard and Westbrook.
"The Spurs were a championship winning team with multiple great players (Duncan, Kawhi, Parker, Ginobili), went 16-7 in the playoffs after having the best record in the league and had the most dominate finals performance of all time against a Lebron James led team. They dominated that year."
"Similar scoring?  Yeah  Shaq 23.7 ppg   Hakeem 21.8 ppg  Less than 1 bucket of difference is similar scoring, or in Shaq's case ~3.8 free throws.  &gt;That is a significant gap in scoring production. That's like saying Lebron James and Jayson Tatum are similar scorers.  Career averages so far   Tatum: 17.2  Lebron: 27.1  Using your argument since Tatum has scored 23 ppg this season he is closer to scoring than Lebron, however in my argument for their careers Lebron is clearly the better scorer(which he is).  By the way 4 points per game difference is double the difference of Hakeem vs Shaq's scoring.  &gt;Shaq is the most dominant scorer in NBA history outside of Jordan.  Wilt Chamberlain  Kareem Abdul Jabbar  James Harden   Like bro I'm not only talking about primes here, I'm talking about who was better over the course of their entire career."
Similar scoring?   Shaq in his prime (1993-2003) averaged 28.1ppg on 58.4% TS   Hakeem in his prime (85-96) averaged 24.3ppg on 55.7% TS    That is a significant gap in scoring production. That's like saying Lebron James and Jayson Tatum are similar scorers. There is no comparison scoring wise between Shaq and Hakeem. Shaq is the most dominant scorer in NBA history outside of Jordan.
"Cavs, you really gonna trust Harden to close out Lebron James in a close Finals game"
Oh people still make fun of you guys. 1 championship won’t shut people up. Lucky there wasn’t no LeBron James in the east last year to put you guys in your place no cap
"&gt;[In 21 games with a similar group of players, they played at an anemic 18-win pace (-8.9 SRS) before injuries ravaged their lineup.](https://backpicks.com/2018/04/05/backpicks-goat-3-lebron-james/)  They were shit even when healthy."
You’re comparing a bench player to a 2x MVP and the only unanimous MVP. By your logic James Jones is as great as LeBron
"In those seasons:  * Luka Doncic: 28.7 pts, 58.4% TS  * LeBron James: 27.2 pts, 55.4% TS * Magic Johnson: 18.0 pts, 60.2% TS * Lonzo Ball: 10.2 pts, 44.4% TS"
Exactly. A large component of the appeal for sports trolls is they want to piss off someoens stanbase. He doesn’t really have stans so shitting on Duncan doesn’t really have an appeal like a Lebron James or a Kobe Bryant.
PG: Stephen Curry  SG: Michael Jordan   SF: Larry Bird  PF: Lebron James  C: Kareem Abdul Jabber  I would want Miami Lebron in this lineup that was a little more post than perimeter. Bird and Curry need to provide the spacing for the team.
Offensively AD is lightyears better but Dwight was an absolute monster defensively and on the boards. AD is obviously no slouch there either but Dwight was generational. People forget that there was at one time a debate over who you'd start a franchise with - Dwight Howard or Lebron James. And this was during Lebron's athletic peak back in 2008-2010!
"Chris Paul  LeBron James  Kyle Collinsworth  Damian Lillard  Ish Smith  I feel happy to have Lillard, James, and CP3 but disappointed in Kyle and Ish."
LeBron Jeffrey James would never
LeBron GOAT James
The Spurs utterly destroyed them in 2014 and the Heat were hopeless without Lebron. This was demonstrated in Game 1 when the Heat led 86-79 with 9 minutes to go. Lebron was impacted by the heat and cramps and the Spurs finished the game by outscoring them 31-9 (16-3 once James left the floor).   There is no way the Heat would have won another ring or likely even made it through the East the next few years.

"&gt; kareem won one championship as the best player on his team in probably the weakest era in the nba in terms of facing dynasties and he had oscar robertson as a side kick for that one  He won 2 championships as the best player on his team, doing it so in 1971 and 1980 which is one less than LeBron James. Also you mention that Oscar Robertson was his side kick, should i mention Dwyane Wade and Kyrie Irving for you?  &gt; also to say kareem was the better defender between the two in their primes is also up for debate  It's not and it has never been, the only reason Kareem doesn't have multiple DPOYs is because the award didn't exist back in the 70's. Kareem made the All-Defensive team 11 times in his career (5 in the 1st team and 6 in the 2nd) doing it so the last time in 1984 at age 37. LeBron has made 6 All-Defensive teams in his career (5 in the 1st and 1 in the 2nd) and has not made a single All-Defensive team since turning 30.  &gt; Also I hate this argument but I have to mention lebron is a pass first player and in his prime could've averaged 30+, not to say kareem isn't a great passer  Also false, LeBron averages 19.6 FGA and 8.0 FTA for his career, there is not a single player in the universe that averages this amount of shots that is a pass first player, in fact he averages more FGA for his career than Kobe Bryant and Kareem. He is a scorer who also happens to be a great passer, there is a huge difference there. Kareem was also a fantastic passer for most of his career out of the post and his numbers only dipped when he started to play with Magic and he got older.  &gt; but in my list and most who have seen both kareem is below lebron  ALSO false, most experts, former players and analysts that don't have Michael Jordan in the top (they are wrong btw, but whatever) have Kareem or Magic Johnson at No.1.  Like i said and i will repeat myself, LeBron has no argument AT THIS POINT to be put ahead of Kareem, Wilt or Michael. He doesn't have the accomplishments, he wasn't significantly better in his peak (in fact i would argue he wasn't better than any of them) and he doesn't have the team success.  LeBron, as Kobe did, will only be properly ranked when he's done, right now people either overrate him terribly (calling him the GOAT) or underrate him (saying he is barely top 10)."
"&gt;Funny how that logic only applies to Bill Russell and not any other player in NBA history.  You mean the logic that explains the on-court impact of the greatest all-time defender and pioneer of the fastbreak offence?  Yeah, that logic does only apply to Bill Russell.   &gt;What? Heinsohn literally made more All-NBA teams than James Worthy, Ray Allen and Reggie Miller while being in teams with ridiculous amount of talent.  And why was an inefficient volume scorer able to do that while playing on a team with other inefficient volume scorers?  There shouldn't have been space for all those guys to get their All-Star / HOF numbers.  Because Bill Russell ran the team in a way that gave all those guys their opportunities. Bill Russell's breakneck offence and crippling defence meant the Celtics played with huge possession advantages, which meant there was always enough shots to go around.  Their offence was always sub-par and it would never have worked without the huge handicap Bill Russell was giving them.  That's why the team would fall apart when he didn't play. They had a 30-win pace in games where he sat and they went from Champions to the lottery the year he retired.   When it comes to other stars there aren't enough opportunities to go around for everyone because the star player (rightfully) takes those opportunities. You can fit another 1-2 stars next to them, but then you start to run out of space.   Bill was different. He played in a way that meant there was space for everyone.     ***  You mentioned Scottie Pippen.   * How many FGA did Scottie use to get?    He averaged 14.8 FGA during his time in Chicago. He could have shot more, but as the #2 he had to make sacrifices for Jordan.   Then you look at the 5th-6th man on those teams, they would only get ~4-6 FGA per game. That 5th-6th option player would never have the opportunity to make a HOF bid because there wouldn't be enough shots left over for them to showcase their talents.    * Why did Kevin Love go from a 26ppg to 16ppg when he joined Cleveland?   Because there weren't enough shots to go around for the 3rd option to be taking 18 FGA per game. He had to sacrifice his role to make space for Lebron and Kyrie. He ended up being a 13 FGA guy.   The 1960 Celtics had 5 guys averaging ≥14 FGA and their 6th man averaged 10 FGA. They were able to do this because Bill Russell's presence meant they had a huge possession advantage over most teams.  More possessions meant more shots to go around, more opportunities for guys to showcase their talents."
"I'm not talking about 2014 team, I'm talking about his first championship team. Shane Battier, Mike Miller and James Jones were all good three point shooters. And 2013 team had even better three point shooting with Ray Allen and Lebron shooting 40 percent from 3 that year."
It does spill over sometimes though. Marcus Thompson wrote about how some nba players resented Steph in his book (https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/stephen-curry-book-marcus-thompson-lebron-james-russell-westbrook-dislike-warriors/19tkdxqaeo40p1598n07undcew). He threw out a couple of names like Russ and Bron but in one of the podcasts he did to promote the book (i believe it was the old basketball friends pod with espn) he specifically singled out CP3 as someone who really does not like him
"bigger than any sports star today, including Messi and Ronaldo  you know what the highest grossing movie ever was? if you said avengers endgame, your right, but if you adjust for inflation, Gone with the Wind, blows it away by like a billion dollars  media, entertainment, public interests, are just so much more scattered and diverse than they used to be  yes soccer is bigger than basketball, there's no denying that, and there is so much more media today, it's easy to think that todays athletes must be ""bigger"" but it's the opposite, there was less media, less sports, less players and leagues that were seen as ""legit"" so the ones that were were even more celebrated, and none moreso than jordan  (it didnt hurt that he was the greatest product marketer in history)  edit: in comparison to lebron you can look at US television ratings to see how much more interest there was in jordan, for example, in the 98 finals 36M people watched game 6 (US pop was only 276.1M) the only games that's come close is 2016 game 7 with 31M viewers, but US pop in 2016 is 323.4M) 2016 finals would've had to increase viewership by like 40% to show same level of interest as 98  &amp;#x200B;  edit 2: that the U.S.'s global status was so much higher in the 90s helps, as well as in the U.S. the prevalence of network television and the nba's presence on it. If I asked my 75 year old white grandma if she knew who michael jordan was in the 90s, she wouldve looked at me like I was crazy, If i ask my 65 year old white mom to pick lebron james out of a lineup right now, she would have no clue."
My opinion rankings:  1. Michael Jordan 2. Kobe Bryant (rip legend💜💛) 3. Lebron James 4. Wilt Chamberlain  5. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 6. Bill Russell  7. Magic Johnson 8. Larry Bird 9. Tim Duncan 10. Dirk Nowitzki
"I’m very unsure that Durant has surpassed Larry Bird. Based on that alone, he is nowhere near LeBron James in terms of legacy."
I will sing Kobe's praises as a basketball talent until my lungs fail me.   But Jordan was a class of his own.   Above Kobe.   And *certainly* above LeBron.   No fucking question.   Queen James? Nah hahaha   When Jordan won his 6th ring I spent the next 20 minutes running around my neighborhood with 6 fingers held high!   No one since can claim that.   Not even Kobe...   And certainly not LeBron's losing ass lol
"In what world has Durant surpassed Bird? The one where the NBA started with LeBron James to some fans?   You made a casual sweeping statement about Durant beating him in every aspect other than passing which is just flat out wrong (which has since been edited). Durant has volume scoring over Bird and that’s it. Bird beats him in every category and also in accolades.   As for scoring titles, Durant won one scoring 27.7 ppg and another with 28.0 ppg. Bird had 3 seasons higher than those of 28.1, 28.7 and 29.9 that resulted in a grand total of 0 scoring crowns.  Is it close? Sure no problem with the argument, but Durant is not a top 10 player ever as of 2020 whereas Bird still is, even with almost another 30 years worth of talent coming into the league after his retirement."

"he might be the worst nba ""journalist""  no one praises skip bayless knock it off   he has no data? he just says lebron is the best player, on extremely cherry picked data  lebron james is the first 33 year old to score 30 pts and have 8 assists and 12 rebounds, on a tuesday, in february, on the road, before all star break, on 22 or less shots, vs the suns   that sentence which nick will read for every lebron random game, means jack shit, lebron put up 33-8-12 on a tuesday vs the suns, cool, but nick will go omg its never been done on a tuesday for a 33 year old!!   also  when people mention usage rate and lebron using ever possesion ever to get his 10 assists, nick quickly shuts the fuck up"
KD cannot hope to surpass LeBron James?James
I doubt it considering [he got backlash for this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/12/24/lebron-james-apologizes-jewish-money-instagram-post/)
"Lebron James 2007 ECF Game 5 (Series tied 2-2) on the road.  Double OT 109-107 win. 48 points, 9 rebounds, 7 assists. 54.5 FG%  Lebron scored 29 of Cleveland's final 30 points, including the team's last 25 points. Shooting 11-13.  He was only 21.  Edit: 22, my bad  I rate it slightly above Game 6 vs Boston because that game was no contest by the 4th quarter, and with a better team around him.  Cleveland needed each and every one of Lebron's points to escape by the skin of their teeth."
"Magic had the best individual teammate out of the two, but those Celtics teams around '84-'86 are often cited in ""deepest team"" discussions. I don't think there's much to the teammate argument.  Lebron is the [best player](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/25/17391262/lebron-james-king-elimination-games) in elimination games (unless you want to argue Russell from a W/L perspective). But he clearly out-performs MJ/KAJ/Magic/etc from any angle here. He's not really just front-running on poor competition every year.  Agreed on the last two though."
"&gt; Swept the defending champs Lakers,  Which team in the modern era has been the same after three straight Finals runs? Detroit got destroyed by Chicago in 1991, the Lakers lost to the Spurs in 2003, Boston lost to Miami in 2011, and Miami got wrecked by San Antonio in 2014. Either way, the Lakers weren't clearly better than the Mavericks that season.  &gt; beat OKC 3 future MVPs  Not a single one of which were in their primes. Durant and Westbrook were both 22. Even mentioning James Harden is a joke considering he was averaging 12 PPG that season.   &gt;  and the Heat 3 HOFs  After the biggest choke of all time from LeBron James. If he plays at even 80% of his normal level, Miami wins that series."
"Give everyone not named Anthony Davis and LeBron James lol. Still tho, idk how they match salary with their trade pieces."
"Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, LeBron James"
"The wins argument from his first retirement is dumb. Horace Grant became an all-star, they added Toni Kukoc and Steve Kerr, and were knocked out in the 2nd round. Plus it can be used the other way to show they went from 47 wins to 72 wins when he came back from retirement.   It's also nuts to use the ""Couldn't win without a stacked team"" argument. You think the 91 Bulls were stacked? Or the old and broken 97-98 Bulls? Kareem played alongside Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and James Worthy for his rings. LeBron literally built his championship teams with other all-stars in Wade/Bosh and Kyrie/Love.   You could also argue that the NBA was just as weak in the 2010s when tanking became prevalent."
" In case anyone wanted to see the scoring breakdown:     Michael Jordan – 61,835     LeBron James - 54725     Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - 43931     Magic Johnson - 30348     Wilt Chamberlain - 27581     Larry Bird - 24559     Kobe Bryant - 24270     Bill Russell - 21811     Shaquille O'Neal - 18492     Tim Duncan - 17619"
It may seem that he's biased because Lebron is just that good. He gives equal praise to Harden but no one calls him a James Harden dickrider. People pick and choose his takes to get mad at because there's a large number of people who have a weird fixation on shitting on Lebron and anything that goes against that they end up hating the opposing narrative.
"LeBron. LeBron GOAT James is the best. Everybody loves him, everybody thinks he's the best, the GOAT. I love NBA!!"
"He wore joe Namath jersey game one, Jackie Robinson jersey game two and Wayne gretzkey jersey game three before the MJ get up  [Kobe](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/03/kobe-bryant-lebron-james-michael-jordan-jersey)"
"That was always the argument against Jordan when he was coming up. He didn't have any championships. Magic and Bird dominated the 80's. Jordan's teams were bad, but he was a phenom. The criticism was he couldn't win.   He kept getting better. Some just dismissed him as  a highlight film, but not a winner. He stayed with Chicago and kept chipping away advancing further in the playoffs.   Eventually, they beat the two time defending champions with their whole team back in the Eastern Conference Finals. Then facing the Showtime Lakers with Magic Johnson, James Worthy, Byron Scott, in the NBA Finals.   Everyone thought the Magic was going to collect ring number six. He won the first game, but then the Bulls swept the next four. He fought and earned those.   That is why some people think KD going to Golden State or Lebron going to Miami was weak. They didn't stick with their original team to fight and win on their own. They went to teams with players and teams that had already won a championships without them."
"**Atlantic Division:** Ben Simmons, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Pascal Siakam, Mitchell Robinson.    **Central Division:** Victor Oladipo, Zach LaVine, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love.    **Southeast Division:** Trae Young, Brad Beal, Jimmy Butler, PJ Washington, Nikola Vucevic.    **Northwest Division:** Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Karl-Anthony Towns, Nikola Jokic.    **Pacific Division:** Steph Curry, Buddy Hield, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, DeAndre Ayton.    **Southwest Division:** Luka Doncic, James Harden, Zion Williamson, Jaren Jackson Jr, LaMarcus Aldridge."
"Yeah, let's act like basketball also isn't a team sport and Wilt lost most, if not all, of these games while outplaying Russell.  1965 Eastern Division Finals Gm 7: Wilt 30-32-2 on 12-15 FG to Russell's 15-29-8 on 7-16 FG.  1969 NBA Finals Gm 7: Wilt 18-27-3 on 7-8 FG to Russell's 6-21-6 on 2-7 FG.  Those are just two examples of games that Wilt lost by one possession were he clearly outplayed Bill.  This argument that Russell owned Chamberlain is so stupid it doesn't even make sense, Wilt averaged 30-28-3 when playing against Russell, but lost most of the games due to the Celtics being the most stacked team in the history of the game.  It would be like saying Paul Pierce was better than LeBron James because he beat him consistently from 2008 to 2010 and won most of their matchups up until he got old."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4nlJy3RwYI  https://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/?SeasonYear=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=PPP&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=POSS*GE*5:GP*GE*41   https://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=PPP&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=GP*GE*41:POSS*GE*4&amp;SeasonYear=2018-19  In 2018, CP3 and Harden led the league in isolation points per possession (PPP) for players with 5 or more isolation possessions per game.  His isolation scoring dropped from 1.10 PPP to .92 PPP from 2018 to 2019. This is obviously just one facet of a player's game, but let's assume he had a .92 PPP in 2018. In third that year was LeBron James, with .96 PPP, followed by John Wall with .95 PPP. Notice that the difference between 1.10 and .96 is pretty huge. Well if you plug in CP3's 2019 numbers, he drops from being second by a large margin to being 4th. To make matters worse, his number of possessions dropped a bit, which means that even though he didn't run as much isos, he still declined in how well he scored in those situations.  People act surprised that CP3 is still good this year, but he's always been good. The real decline was from 2018 to 2019. 2019 CP3 was still good, but he did worse that playoffs, and every bit of skill lost matters against a team as good as the Warriors.  Also, I'm not here to argue who wins in 2018 with fully healthy teams, but you should at least acknowledge the 2019 Rockets were not the same team as the 2018 Rockets. They lost their best two wing defenders in Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute (Mbah a Moute didn't play versus the Warriors in the 2018 playoffs though)."
LeBron James
"This is not going to be who I think is the best at every position, but instead the team I think would work best in the modern NBA.      PG: Steph Curry  SG: Jordan  SF: Lebron James  PF: Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, or Kevin Durant (I’m a little torn on this choice)  Center: Hakeem  I know KD is not a traditional power forward btw for the people who are going to mention that."
"I'll take the ""MV3"" argument to the grave. We all know how bad LeBron's team eventually became after he left, but he had Mo Williams at least. A veteran point guard who could knock down 3s.  Wade literally took the remnants of a 15 win team to the playoffs as a 5 seed (east was terrible, but that argument can be used against LeBron too). Hell, that team may have been worse because you had two rookies (Chalmers/Beasley), a few corpses (Jermaine O'Neal, PJ Brown) along with journeymen such as Jamario Moon and James Jones getting big minutes.  Dwyane Wade is my 2009 MVP."
Lebron had James
"Yeah, people are definitely going to get upset if LeBron ""peak human fitness"" James is getting tested daily while elderly are being turned away cause there aren't enough tests available."
"&gt;I'll have to look, but I think he was I'm the MVP conversation  2016 MVP Voting:  1. Steph Curry 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. LeBron James 4. Russell Westbrook 5. Kevin Durant 6. Chris Paul 7. Draymond Green 8. Damian Lillard 9. James Harden 10. Kyle Lowry  2015 MVP Voting:  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. LeBron James 4. Russell Westbrook 5. Anthony Davis 6. Chris Paul 7. LaMarcus Aldridge 8. Marc Gasol/**Blake Griffin** 9. Tim Duncan/Kawhi Leonard/Klay Thompson  Maybe you mean as far back as 2014, where he was 3rd behind KD and LeBron? With KD having 119 out of 125 votes, and LeBron the other 6?"
"The Top 10 I'd say is quite clear cut and also the Top 2.  The problem occurs with Bill, Wilt, Jerry West, and Big O (and even Kareem's early days), when stats collection was incomplete. And almost definitely no advanced stats, not to mention the game itself was totally different.  Players averaged 40+ min regularly in the 60s. Wilt once averaged 48.5 mpg!  Here is my Top 10 when taking into account  * Advanced stats normalized with t/z-scores against peers * Advanced Playoff stats again normalized like above * Individual accolades per season * Team accolades per season  **My Top 10**  &amp;#x200B;  |**Ranking**|**Player**|**Advanced Stats**|**Achievements**|**Total Score**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1|Michael Jordan|115.6|115.9|231.4| |2|Lebron James|119.8|104.8|224.5| |3|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|101.9|106.9|208.9| |4|Bill Russell|N/A|109.3|N/A| |5|Magic Johnson|104.8|108.3|213.1| |6|Tim Duncan|105.4|106.5|212.1| |7|Wilt Chamberlain|N/A|103.3|N/A| |8|Kobe Bryant|101.2|105.6|206.7| |9|Larry Bird|100.6|1045.6|206.2| |10|Shaquille O'Neal|104.6|101.6|206.2| ||||||  &amp;#x200B;  Hakeem would be at 11. Of the current gen, Kawhi is next in line to potentially vault into this Top 10. Both Kawhi and Durant need to maintain their advanced stats and achieve more individual and team success of course."
&gt;  makes no sense to keep him.  Such a shitty outlook goddamn.  Blow it up so we suck for 3 more years and hope to get another dame? We got a top 10 player who's cool as fuck and has two of the coolest moments in NBA history and he's loyal to this small market team and people think we should trade him lmao.     &gt; leave in mediocrity for years at best like they are now.  Didn't realize making the WCF was mediocrity.  We were at worst the 3 best team in the west last year.  Are we gonna win a title?  Extremely unlikely.  Doesn't mean there's not value in being a good team year after year.  We're not LA we can't just suck donkey dick for a few years and then sign Lebron James.
"It’s pretty amazing that two players, Kawhi and Iggy, have won the finals MVP based solely on how they could slow down the freight train that is Lebron James."
... LeBron. The name you're so blatantly trying to avoid is LeBron James.
"Lebron James doing Space Jam just feels like a poser thing to do.   Space Jam worked because of MJ, his retirement, baseball, and return, his life just fell in to place in a way that was perfect for Space Jam.   Lebron just feels like someone said “Hey you’re better than MJ, you should have your own Space Jam!”"
"how is it underrated. they literally included in the trilogy of thes. THE BLOCK, THE SHOT, THE STOP. they are almost always mentioned together. only the block gets upgraded more than it should be. since blocked by james and it is lebron. if anything the shot is underrated mike even said he regrets not using his patented BANG"

Covid 19 has been designed to keep Lebron James' superteam from letting us down.
Houston looked like they had game 7 in the bag. The only reason why this narrative that they were unstoppable is pushed is because Lebron got smoked in both finals.  &amp;#x200B;  I wonder if James Harden would have received the same love after beating the 2018 Warriors that Lebron does for winning in 2016... doubt it.
Before I got real into the NBA at all I played I believe 2k12 over at this couples house that I was selling weed to at the time ( and ended up being their live in dealer for a year after that)  the dude would always play as LeBron and I played as the Celtics with Ray Allen. One game I had 40 points 9 made threes and I was convinced he was the best player in the league. Then I started watching actual basketball and started my trip on the James harden train.

"AD was on the call  &gt;Chris Paul, the president of the players association, arranged the call that included LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook, sources said.  https://ca.news.yahoo.com/sources-nba-superstars-establish-united-front-on-private-conference-call-to-resume-season-210518262.html"
Imagine being two years removed from high school and having LeBron James in your grill with that demonic look on his face.
"I’m positive pay and timing are a big deal as well, but the rest of it’s just not as simple as you seem to think it is. If a player tests positive they then have to test everyone that player came into contact with since their last test, potentially ruling out multiple players and throwing an asterisk onto that round of the playoffs unless they stop play entirely. Again, this is if they have the testing capacity and can acquire it without taking it away from essential businesses.   And again, the Walmart analogy doesn’t make sense. The NBA is not an essential service; they don’t have to stay open, so if they endanger anyone by reopening they’ll take a huge PR hit. Walmart’s product also isn’t compromised if specific people have to go into quarantine for two weeks - there is no LeBron James of Walmart. They’re completely different kinds of businesses.   To be clear, I’m happy to be wrong if there’s a work-able solution, and a lot of smarter people than myself are working on it, but this line of reasoning doesn’t make any sense to me."
"I don't like the top ten. For one, Bill Russell is ranked too high at 4. His numbers( outside of rebounding)  are pedestrian which in that era should have been monstrous. No way he's fourth.   10. Bill Russell  9. Larry Bird  8. Tim Duncan 7. Shaquille O'Neal 6. Magic Johnson 5. Kobe Bryant 4. LeBron James 3. Wilt Chamberlain 2. Kareem Abdul Jabar 1. Michael Jordan  I love LeBron but let's wait until he wins a few more rings before we put him ahead of Kareem, Wilt, and Jordan. He wins two more rings. I'll put him second. Three more. He's first all time."
"There's no coming back from that. It wasn't just that he didn't play well. It got to the point where he appeared afraid to be aggressive. Jason Terry and JJ actually broke him that series. Then his ""y'all still have to go to work on Monday and I'm still LeBron James"" comment post-game--no way to ever recover to GOAT status from that."
"Anthony Davis yelled, “Away you go!” Kyle Kuzma gave a look of mild disgust. Rajon Rondo belted, “We got a [expletive] infection now.” And before LeBron James went into quarantine, ex-NBA star Magic Johnson waved from 6 feet away &amp; said, “Y’all look so sick.”"
"Who is repsonsible if an NBA player contracts and then dies of Covid-19 ?  It is not a completely implausible scenario.  What's the risk/reward for playing a few extra games now?  Imagine if after 2 games, Lebron or Curry gets Covid and dies.  How much would those couple of games ultimately cost the NBA as a whole?  Would they compansate the James or Curry estate $1/2 billion for a lifetime of lost income ?"
"I'm also a fan of the tiered argument.    I have my tiers as follows:  (1a) Michael Jordan  (1b) LeBron James  (3-6) Kareem, Magic, Russell, Wilt  (7-11) Kobe, Shaq, Duncan, Bird, Hakeem.  &amp;#x200B;  My opinion is that these groupings are more or less interchangeable depending on what you want to prioritize.  I do think LBJ has separated himself from the pack but has not yet displaced MJ.   Kareem, Magic, Russell, or Wilt depends on how you factor longevity, dominance, flair, stats, championships, etc.  For instance, you might argue that Russell wouldn't be a top player in this day and age, but its hard to argue with 11 championships so he has to be up there somewhere.   I probably underrate Bird more than most.  I grew up watching him play - he has titles, MVPs, and stats to back up being higher on the list.  I just don't find him quite as dominant as those above him.  He rates closer to a Tim Duncan to me, which isn't a slight at all.    Its fun to argue about how to reorder these lists.  I think there's probably a clear cut top 3 and a clear cut top 11 - at least unless Curry, Durant, Kawhi, and maybe Giannis start knocking on the door if they can have another few years or more of dominance and a few more titles.  Obviously Giannis has a lot of work to do, but he's young."
"That pick was No. 1 protected, meaning the Grizzlies would have retained the selection and picked LeBron James themselves.  Edit: This is why [Jerry West low key looks like he may kill a man](https://youtu.be/DQ2uCV4g6Nw) when that Memphis logo was revealed at No.2. It meant that not only did they just miss LeBron but they lost the pick altogether."
"Every year LeBron James should've won, he did, except the 2011 finals. One chokejob doesn't negate a literal decade of dominance.  Let me pose a question to you, though. Outside of 2011, which of LeBron's finals teams do you genuinely believe would've won rather than lost if you switched Bron and MJ? You really think MJ could've done so much better than 28ppg on 65% true shooting that it would reverse the 4-1 series victory by the Spurs in 2014? How about Lebron's 35ppg in the 2015? MJ would've done so much better with Delly as his #2 that it would've changed the outcome of a convincing 4-2 series win by the Warriors? MJ would've beat the KD Warriors with those Cavs teams? The same Cavs teams that lost 8-1 against the Warriors across both finals despite LeBron James averaging a 32 point triple double on 63% true shooting across both finals? How much have you idealized MJ in your head, man?"
"You mean Carmelo ""stole a vote away from near-unanimous MVP LeBron James"" Anthony? Nah man, he must've been one of the best players in the league to have done that!   ..... im not salty you're salty"
Similar to me.    -  Michael Jordan -  Lebron James -  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -  Magic Johnson -  Bill Russell -  Wilt Chamberlain/Larry Bird/Tim Duncan (Order for 6-9 is all pretty tough to me.).  -  Hakeem/Shaq/Oscar/Kobe. (I will go back and forth with my 10th pick and only lean Hakeem because of my own bias since he's my personal fav player of all time.  I think Durant ends up making this conversation even more difficult in the future if he comes back healthy.
"Im at work so I can't pull out all the stats I'd want to right now, but you're wrong. Kareem dominated in the regular season in a similar fashion to MJ and Bron, but it's really not even close when you look at playoffs.  KAJ, MJ, and Bron are the undisputed 3 best players to have on your team for the regular season, and you honestly couldn't go wrong with any of the 3.  But for playoffs? You're at a significant disadvantage taking literally anyone but LeBron James or Michael Jordan."
"Tier 3 IMO. Tier 1 is for Bird, Jordan, Magic, Timmy, Shaq, Moses Malone, Kraeem, Kobe, etc. etc.  Tier 2 is Kevin Garnett, Hakeem Olajuwan, Zeke, Dirk Nowitzki, Karl Malone, Dr. J (for NBA), Lebron James and Steph Curry (could've been tier 1), etc. etc.  Then there is tier 3 with Charles Barkley, AI, Steve Nash, Kevin Durant, etc. etc."
"Curry has one more title, KD has 2 FMVPs in boht Finals they played together, he was the best player in the Warriors on those championships then I don’t understand your ""A player’s greatness is judged by his contribution to winning"" like KD didn’t lead OKC to multiples 60-wins seasons, 4 WCF in 6 years and one Finals where he averaged 30 pgg at 23 yo.   You need context for everything, KD had to go against LeBron James in his prime that’s why he hasn’t more MVPs. He has more top 2-finishes and MVP level seasons than Steph Curry, he just dominated more and longer.   KD will ne remembered as one of the greatest scorers of all time and an unique offensive weapon wether you likes him or not. And yes he is higher than Steph right now.  Dirk isn’t ahead of Malone in an AT list lmaooo, wtf are you talking about. Malone is in that 12-15 range when Dirk is barely top 20, how old are you ? Malone led his team 2x in the Finals and had to compete against the GOAT, he has more deep playoffs runs than Dirk, 2nd in the all time scoring list, more MVPs etc.   KD has many arguments against Curry : Longevity, Regular season dominance, more accolades, postseason dominance. Tf.  David Robinson wasn’t a better player than Hakeem and didn’t dominate like him that’s why he is placed below, another bad comparison."
"LeBron was on a winning team and consistently great in 2005-2006. The Cavs went 50-32 while the Suns went 54-28.   Steve Nash: 18.8 PPG, 4.2 RPG and 10.5 APG  LeBron James: 31.4 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 6.6 APG"
"Yeah and the Heat had, you know, Lebron James. The Knicks had 0 chance. The only question was 4, 5 or 6?"
"Lebron James wants his chip for his legacy especially with the Last Dance documentary making his accomplishments and play look like a tier below MJ's and maybe even Kobe Bryant's. He knows this year's is as good a chance as any when you factor in his age, the Warriors having been out this season, and having Anthony Davis on the team. He is majorly pushing for a resumed season behind the scenes (including his camp, orbiters, and the Lakers org). I don;t think he cares about an asterisk, especially when it won't likely even be there when you list James' accomplishments many years from now, i.e., X championship rings to his name. He wants to be in the GOAT conversation at least. Now if you'll excuse me, here come the James-stan stampede."
"I like these ones  - Anthony ""Power Rangers SPD"" Tolliver  - Jamal ""Bush with Legs"" Murray  - LeBron ""King"" James"
"I’m from Nash’s home province and he’s a hero here but he shouldn’t have won two MVPs.   In 2006:  Steve Nash: 18.8 PPG, 4.2 RPG and 10.5 APG  LeBron James: 31.4 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 6.6 APG  Dirk Nowitzki: 26.6 PPG, 9.0 RPG, 2.8 APG  Kobe Bryant: 35.4 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 4.5 APG"
Vince yamming it on Alonzo Mourning is up there.  that dunk was nasty.  i will also accept LeBron James with no regard for human life or (personal favorite) Jayson Tatum dunking on LeBron's head during the ECF his rookie season.
Lebron James with no regard for human life
German here. My parents and most (mostly older) people with no basketball knowledge have no idea who Lebron James is.
"People may call me bias but imo a CP3/Harden lead Rockets as peak performance was better during that series, we have no idea what would’ve happened in the finals, considering there was a pretty decent player named LeBron James on the other team being guarded by a player he has a rivalry with, Ariza. But realistically, with two elite scoring options on the floor and no Iggy. The warriors can only watch, the warriors main weakness is the PnR defense and they lost probably the deadliest PnR in the league when CP went down, Harden and Capela are good but not close to CP. You’re sadly right how it’s all in the past now, if only"
"No it’s just you who are overrating the MVP, KD has longevity + more dominance in the Regular Season than Curry, one MVP doesn’t change that.    Shaq and Kobe are ahead of Nash because they were more dominant and flat out just better players overall.   There are people who place Hakeem above Shaq because of the way he won his titles for example, without All Star around him. So I don’t understand  your point.   There isn’t just championship and MVP, KD has more accolades just stop it. KD has more FMVPs, more All NBA, more All Stars, more scoring titles etc. It’s not close.  Durant had to compete against a top 3 of the greatest players in history at his prime named LeBron James otherwise he would have 4 MVP right now, he has many more seasons where he dominated in the regular season than Curry. It’s all about circumstances and narratives.   Did you just say Durant has no argument over Curry in the GOAT list ? You must be 15 year old or you just don’t know shit about basketball.  Curry had just a higher peak and that’s about it. Longevity, individual dominance in the regular and postseason, it’s KD."
"# Some coaches may die but that's a risk we're willing to take -   ^(LeBron James, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Stephen Curry probably)"
"Pretty good, I would make a few minor changes (Wilt higher / Hakeem in the top 10 instead of Kobe)  1. Michael Jordan 2. Lebron James 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. Wilt Chamberlain 5. Bill Russell 6. Magic Johnson 7. Larry Bird 8. Tim Duncan 9. Hakeem Olajuwon 10. Shaquille O’Neal 11. Kobe Bryant"
I remember watching this live man it got me hype . What a honor it ha seven to watch Lebron James play . I wonder who skip will talk about once he retires lol
Maybe Lebron James can fix this?

"Shannon: SKIIIIEEEEEUUUUPPP! How you gonna dog LeBron ""King"" James like that? What more does this man have to prove?  Skip: Well I'd like to see him carry a solo team to the championship before I'm convinced he's a great player. Jordan could carry a solo team if he had the chance!"
"for anyone to say an NBA championship is easier to win than a SB must not really follow the NFL. For the Patriots to have 2 separate dynasties in different eras is unheard of. An NFL team can’t just draft a lebron james kind of player and automatically become SB contenders, much less playoff contenders. There are so many factors that have to go an NFL team’s way for them to even have a chance of winning an SB. I think it’s actually absurd how your friend had such a serious take for the nba."
Hampering the manufactured legacy of Lebron James would be like...the only upside of coronavirus.
LeBron James: dunks  **3 seconds later**  CROWD HYPE
"If LeBron contracts Covid-19 and dies as a result of the NBA re-opening pre-maturely, they would say “This is absolutely ridiculous! Cancel the fucking season already!!”   But they're not interested in other people's health and safety. They don't care if James Harden or Jeff Green dies. As long as Lebron wins title, they'll be happy."
"I'm assuming you're basing this off the 1996 ECF, sure he guarded shaq but it's not like he contained him. This was also early Shaq who was nothing like the 2000s shaq. They got sweeped but Shaq still put up 27pts at 64% fg. Even mutombo who is one of the greatest defensive players of all time couldn't do much vs 2000s shaq.   KD is like Shaq, pretty much unguardable. In 2014 lebron who was playing stellar defense during those years said that nobody could guard KD, and KD has only improved since. Guarding KD and Shaq is nothing like guarding anyone else.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1940629-lebron-james-theres-nobody-that-can-guard-kevin-durant-1-on-1  To say Rodman could do significant damage to KD's game is a really really big stretch considering no one in the league has been able to put a dent into it yet."

"Unpopular opinion but I think this is a horrible and unoriginal take. I’m a Knicks have been since Marburry. KD joining the Warriors was not the weakest move and how can we even quantify the weakest move? KD along with every player in the NBA knows that no matter what you do in the regular season doesn’t matter when your career is over. He saw the OKC Thunder trade away James Harden for who knows why (I don’t care about why you think they traded him, they’ve never said why they traded him truthfully so nobody really knows). Their offense was stale in the postseason and they hired two different coaches that couldn’t get through to Westbrook. KD joined a team that was really good (1-1 in the finals the previous two years). He didn’t ride anybody’s coat tails, he was the best player inarguably on both of those teams. They Warriors were a 73 win team that couldn’t win the Finals. Almost every year NBA free agents try to sign with a team that have a chance to win the finals. LeBron didn’t team up with those guys in Miami because it was the harder route. Kevin Garnett didn’t agree to the Boston trade because it was a harder route. KD did what every player is trying and joined a team that had the potential to win the finals and he was incredibly successful at it. Would everyone respect him more if he joined the Hornets made a couple of second round playoff exits? Most people didn’t like the move which is really understandable it made the Warriors a historically good team. But trying to be degrading and calling it the weakest move ever is way overblown."
You know what Lebron James got on his SAT's?  Barbecue sauce.
Imagine if you are a James Harden fan with a Lebron James Jersey and when flipped you get James Hardens. That would be sick.
"But it was still so exciting. I never had such an emotional sporting experience. Golden State blew them out two straight games to open. Thought the series was done by then. Then clevelends somehow blows out gs in game 3. Nobody could have predicted that at the time. Maybe squeek out a win but not a blow out. Then game 4 is close going into the fourth. Curry and Klay hit back to back 3s and gain all the momentum. LeBron has a fairly weak 4th quarter and Cavs are being blown out by the final 2 mins.  Then LeBron baits draymond into punching his balls and getting suspended. Klay goes on to taunt LeBron after the game famously saying ""I guess he got his feelings hurt. This is a man's game"". The media and reddit are going absolutely insane. LeBron is receiving some of the worst criticism of his life after a relatively poor pivotal game 4 performance. Steph had a dominant 37 pt game causing many to say he was the new best player in the world. Plus he had just won the first ever unanimous mvp, wining back to back and leading a team to a 73-9 record. A redditor famously said something along the lines of ""Curry is the new king. LeBron the new jester, dancing for his king"". While lebron did  have a relatively poor game 4, he did manage to bait Draymond into suspension. Theories of the NBA being rigged were flying around. Going back to game 5 , we're in gstate unsure what the outcome would be. Even with Draymond out there was still a feeling that gstate could win. But then we see Kyrie on absolute fire. Getting to the rim at will, hitting all his open shots and still making well defended shots. To make matters worse, bogut goes down and LeBron also has a dominant game and the pair end up with 41 pts each beating gstate at home. But another great player that game and series was TT who was getting Cavs numerous second chance opportunities. gstate then has to go back to Cleveland for game 6 where we're again unsure what could happen but there was a chance. A chance for that magical game 7. The game opens with Cleveland's being up something like 30-8.  No one can believe their eyes.  But in classic getate fashion , warriors start come back and bring it to within 7 after a big Klay 3. LeBron than goes on to have possibly the greatest finals game in history scoring or assisting on something like 27 of the last 28 pts. On the defensive end he had a huge block on Steph, taunting him after. Steph already in foul trouble picks up his 6th and is furious throwing his mouth piece into the crowd and getting ejected. Everyone had said that LeBron and Kyrie only dropped 41 each because they're was no Draymond. But even with Draymond in, LeBron dropped 41 again. It then goes back to gstate in what is arguably the greatest game 7 in history. The series was tied 3-3 and in pts!! Through 6 games both teams had scored the same amount. The game starts with unbelievable tension with both teams going back and forth. But gstate starts getting into a rhythm and Klay and Steph hit back to back 3s putting the warriors up 7 going into half. At this point my dad told me to bring his keys so I had to drive home and drop them off and drive back to my friends just in time for the third. I believe gstae had just scored again putting them up 9. And then...Jr must have taken a swig of Henny cause he proceeds to go on a 7-0 scoring run on his own. Kyrie also managed to make some unbelievably well guarded shots against Klay and Draymond. Gstate again starts pulling away when LeBron baits barbossa into a 3 pt foul and LeBron uncharacteristically hits all 3. The fourth quarter is tight and the game goes for 4 minutes or so scoreless. Both teams playing relentless defense. Game tied, LeBron drives hard into the paint blowing by Iggy but gets fouled with no call! Gstate ball. Cavs manage to get a stop and Kyrie goes for a tunnel vision drive failing terribly, with warriors grabbing the rebound passing to a fast break curry and iggy. Iggy to curry, curry to iguodala. Iguodala for the lay up. OHHHH blocked by James. LeBron James with the rejection. The biggest play of LeBron's career would go on to be known as  ""the block"". Cavs ball. 1 minute left in the fourth. Cavs get the ball to Kyrie. Kyrie isos curry. Imagine curry and Kyrie as kids watching their fsvorite players wondering if they would ever have moments like that. And here they are. Kyrie steps back , shoots a three over curry. Bang. Cavs up 3. Kyrie hits what's known as ""the shot"" (seperate from MJs obviously).  Warriors ball and they force a switch to get curry on to love. Curry was absolutely big man killer that season and Love was an atrocious defender that season. Perfect match. curry drives but love shuffles his feet quicklys and blocks Curry's path forcing a  reset. Dribbling being crafty, curry eventually going for a three to tie but the ball clanks with Cavs rebounding. This would be known as ""the stop"". Kyrie goes tunnel vision and drives almost turning it over but getting the ball to a cutting LeBron who goes for a poster on Draymond. Draymond having none of it fouls LeBron hard hurting LeBron's wrist in the process. Bron has to go to the line. His biggest fear. Misses the first. Pressure is on but he clanks the second one in! Cavs up 4. Warriors call time out and design a play to put up a 3 but clank. Warriors rebound, one more chance but miss. Games over. Cavs win, LeBron finally brings a promised championship for cleveland beating the greatest team by record in NBA history. Through 7 games, cleveland out scored warriors by 4 pts. An absolute classic. Did I miss anything ?"
"Jordan would never do anything that would help people cement Lebron as the GOAT in their minds. That's also why he made the new documentary, which is just pure MJ propaganda. Dude is scared of King James taking his mantle.  Hint: He already did."

"Here's why the finals MVP argument is stupid: Curry is one of the best finals performers in NBA history.  His career finals averages are 26.5 PPG, 6.2 APG, 5.7 RPG, 1.5 SPG on 58.9 TS%.  Now lets compare this to some other finals MVPs single series stats in which they won the finals MVP going back to years that basketball-reference has scoring efficiency for the finals.   * 2015 - Andre Iguodala - 16.3 PPG, 5.8 APG, 4.0 RPG, 1.3 SPG on 58.8 TS% * 2013 - Lebron James - 25.3 PPG, 7.0 APG, 10.9 RPG, 2.3 SPG, 0.9 BPG on 52.9 TS% * 2011 - Dirk Nowitzki - 26.0 PPG, 9.7 RPG, 2.0 APG, 0.7 SPG, 0.7 BPG on 53.7 TS% * 2010 - Kobe Bryant - 28.6 PPG, 3.9 APG, 8.0 RPG, 2.1 SPG, 0.7 BPG on 52.8 TS% * 2008 - Paul Pierce - 21.8 PPG, 6.3 APG, 4.5 RPG, 1.2 SPG on 58.8 TS% * 2007 - Tony Parker - 24.5 PPG, 3.3 APG, 5.0 RPG, 0.8 SPG, on 59.5 TS% * 2005 - Tim Duncan - 20.6 PPG, 14.1 RPG, 2.1 APG, 2.1 BPG on 47.1 TS% * 1996 - Michael Jordan - 27.3 PPG, 4.2 APG, 5.3 RPG, 1.7 SPG on 53.8 TS% * 1988 - James Worthy - 22.0 PPG, 4.4 APG, 7.4 RPG, 0.7 SPG, 0.6 BPG on 54.4 TS%"
"ESPN: NBA superstars LeBron James, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Stephen Curry held private conference call on Monday and established united front in favor of Giannis Antetokounmpo joining their respective teams"
"Health is much more important than anything specially when you think about its not just players its their families, media, arena workers as well.  Yes, veteran players like LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden actually cares much more than the other players because they just not sure about how long they can still be in their primes how long their teams can be that good etc. Also for coaches like Mike D'Antoni, Brett Brown its their last changes (in their teams). I understand that but for the players who don't want to participate its nothing, they shouldn't worry about other player/teams legacies."
"&gt; LeBron James is a more efficient scorer, he is a more versatile defender, he has better playmaking skills and is a better passer, he is a better rebounder, he is bigger and stronger, and more versatile on offense. LeBron's teams crater worse when he leaves and have improved more when he arrives. LeBron has more sustained longetivity and he has put up his accomplishments in a much tougher NBA*.   The way you're parsing these ideas is hilarious.    Lebron James is a worse scorer, is a worse defender, is a better passer, and he averages 1 rebound more than Jordan does for his career as a forward to a guard.    &gt;  LeBron's teams crater worse when he leaves and have improved more when he arrives.  Lebron ditches teams when they're old/wrecked by cap problems because he signs a bunch of 1+1 contracts leaving his teams with no manuverability and forcing them to sign win now contracts that leave them hamstrung a couple years later.  All 3 franchises he has joined added a whole other allstar when he joined(with the exception of the first year in LA where he finished as the 11th seed in the west).  All 3 times he's left a team they've blown it up soon after either because of age or because the accumulation of shit contracts and vets on 1 year deals.    &gt; On the other hand, Jordan had better teammates, coaches, and front office personnel.   This always makes me laugh.  Three times Lebron has handpicked his team in free agency.  Two of his three rings come from taking a paycut in his prime and colluding with another allstar to join an MVP caliber player.  **He's had more control over his situation than any other player in NBA history**, yet people still whine about his teammates.  The best team he's ever had around him he made it to the finals and choked on a historic level, losing to a team who's 2nd best player was either Tyson Chandler or Jason Terry."
"I think there are five players that people could argue as the GOAT:  1. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - extremely efficient offensive player and could anchor strong defenses + had unparalleled longevity (only starting to be touched by LeBron). He also has plenty of accolades (6 rings, 6 MVPS, most points in NBA history, etc.) 2. Bill Russell - winningest player in NBA history and probably the GOAT defender (11 rings, anchored greatest defensive dynasty in NBA history) 3. Wilt Chamberlain - most physically gifted player in NBA history. Whatever you wanted him to do, he was capable of (100 points in a game, led the league in assists etc). There were a lot of flaws in his game IMO, but I think you can argue that due to his skills and physical gifts, he would dominate in any era. 4. LeBron James - probably the best all around player, can score at an elite level, one of the best passers in NBA history, very good rebounder, when locked in can be a great defender 5. Jordan - Most of the arguments you're probably familiar with  I think you can build a case for any of those five players being the GOAT depending on how you craft your argument. I don't think many people would actually list Jordan fifth, but I think that since you can make a case for the others, you could put Jordan 4 or 5 if you tried."
"LeBron James is a better talent than Michael Jordan.  LeBron James is a more efficient scorer, he is a more versatile defender, he has better playmaking skills and is a better passer, he is a better rebounder, he is bigger and stronger, and more versatile on offense. LeBron's teams crater worse when he leaves and have improved more when he arrives. LeBron has more sustained longetivity and he has put up his accomplishments in a much tougher NBA*.   On the other hand, Jordan had better teammates, coaches, and front office personnel. Jordan has the benefit of a national basketball media that is dominated by his peers, close contemporaries, and people who grew up as beat writers when he played. He has the benefit of being the first global icon, and he had great teammates with perfectly non overlapping skill sets that allowed him to be the obvious and unquestioned face of the franchise.  *Jordan played during a period of expansion that diluted the league. The US population ironically increased by 23% from Jordan's rookie year to LeBron's rookie year. Gallup polling data shows that domestic basketball interest increased by 50% over that span (as judged by response to the question: what is your favorite sport?). The foreign talent pool has greatly improved."
LeBron James is not in top 5 players ever if we talk strictly about basketball and not focus on marketing and things outside of basketball.

"&gt;[Haynes] Yahoo Sources: NBA superstars LeBron James, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Stephen Curry held private conference call on Monday and established   a new super team. They will be joining the hawks, Trae Young has been traded for nothing to the Jazz, he ain't shit."
LeBron James is easier to build a franchise around than Michael Jordan
LeBron James holds a 40 minute speech about the pros and cons about resuming the season. All the other players agree to continue playing.  Skip: And once again the other players saved LeBrons legacy. Closing the deal.
"Hahaha, to the surprise of no one. Spear-headed by one, Lebron James."
"Bleacher Report: Top 10 NBA Stars SNUBBED From Covid Conference Call  ESPN: James Harden excluded from private call between NBA superstars  Skip Bayless: ""Here's what I know - Lebron James organized the Zoom meeting but DIDN'T PAY FOR UNLIMITED!  Just like his game, he showed up for 40 minutes and disappeared for the last 8. Michael Jeffrey Jordan would never.....""  r/nba: \[go ahead, do what you do best\]"
"**SUPERSTAR:**  1.) LeBron James  2.) Giannis Antetokounmpo   3.) Kevin Durant  4.) Steph Curry  5.) Kawhi Leonard  6.) James Harden  7.) Damian Lillard  8.) Russell Westbrook  9.) Nikola Jokic  10.) Luka Doncic  These 10 players change the game at a high dynamic and can have success without the help of a second all star if need to be. These players are true gamechangers.  **STAR:**  11.) Anthony Davis  12.) Kyrie Irving  13.) Paul George  14.) Joel Embiid  15.) Chris Paul  16.) Jimmy Butler  17.)  Kemba Walker  18.) Bradley Beal  19.) Kyle Lowry  20.) Ben Simmons   Players that are very, very good. However, you can’t exactly build a team around a “Star” player without complimenting with other stars if you want to have success.  (Simmons without Embiid can’t make it very far)  (Embiid without Simmons can’t make it very far)  (Davis couldn’t get far without second star/(Was dominant with Boogie)  (Kyrie couldn’t make playoffs or win games without LeBron)  (Paul George in his current state can’t carry a team very far due to his inability to shoot consistently)  (CP3 needs Blake/Harden.)  (Butler needs Embiid/Simmons)  (Kemba couldn’t go very far without a second star/needs Tatum to become a star)  (Beal needs Wall)  (Lowry needs DeRozan or Kawhi)"
"No I don’t think that’s a bad take. For me, a Superstar generally has to have three elements.   - Talent.  - Recognition.  - Playoff prowess.  Obviously Luka is talented. I mean he’s arguably the most talented 20 year old we’ve ever seen. Averaging close to a 30 point triple double in his second season is insane.   He’s well recognized. He has tons of fans in Europe and the Americas. He’s rivalling LeBron James in All-Star voting already.  So yeah, a playoff push is the last thing missing for me. But, he would’ve had that opportunity this season. So that puts him in the fringe superstar category with players like AD, Embiid, and Jokic imo."
"&gt;The Eastern Conference fucking sucked when the Nets made the Finals  Even so, that Nets team had no business making it that far with basically Kidd, Kenyon Martin (whenever he was healthy), Keith Van Horn and Kerry Kittles with Byron fucking Scott as coach  &gt;James Harden (or any MVP level guard) coulda brought that team to the Finals.  Same Harden that didn't show up in 2012? Or the one that ran up the bricks in 2018?  &gt; James Harden has also carried really subpar teams to great records and would likely have won a championship by now if CP3 didn’t get injured in 2018.  Shoulda woulda coulda, I guess you also think LeBron ""won"" a title in 2015"
"I mean, for a guy I figured was—and would continue to be—a second fiddle to to Antawn Jamison coming out of UNC, I think over 20 years in the league, 8 all-star appearances, 10 consecutive seasons of averaging over 20 points per game, and 25,000 career points was actually pretty doggone good.   It takes a 99.9 percenter like LeBron James to take a mediocre team or worse and turn them into contenders. And Vince, for the most part during his prime, wasn't a 99.9 percenter and had a mostly mediocre cast. He wasn't good enough to lift up that level of talent but most in history aren't. I thought he still did pretty well for himself otherwise."
"And that's only because the season was cut short and Kawhi wasn't able to walk all over overrated Luka Doncic in the first round, then stomp on James Harden in round two and then EASILY take care of LeBron ""the frozen one"" James and win a title over Giannis.  Otherwise Kawhi is easily top 10."
"[This play is probably the best example you can give to the ""Lebron is soft"" crowd](https://youtu.be/rIQaMbmPpyw?t=93)  ^ James **literally has his nose broken in the middle of the play** ,and proceeds to finish through the contact and throw down a poster on Ibaka's head.    And the crazy thing is the refs didn't even see the contact! If blood wasn't leaking out of his nose they wouldn't have stopped play.   Never seen anything like this dude ever, pull up all 80s basketball clips all you want .. I don't care.  'Jordan rules' would not work on a 6'9 260lb cyborg who doesn't respond to pain like a normal person.."
"yep. our own president said that global warming was a chinese hoax, that china manufactured the coronavirus to fuck up our economy, and here we are in a comments section of a sick-ass Lebron James dunk completely dissecting his stance on China like it's worse than what actual politicians are saying on the subject these days.   You know it's wild times when Lebron James is held to a higher intellectual standard than the fucking POTUS. I definitely don't agree with what Lebron said on the subject, but the fact that this is such a big deal to people in the current political shitshow we're operating within is hilarious to me."
"It should be on ESPN, will be called The Decision. LeBron James should be the one to announce it."
I would imagine anyone remotely connected to American culture has heard of LeBron James.
If you showed a generic mugshot photo of MJ to my mom she would say Michael Jordan. If you asked her if she knows who Lebron James is she would have no idea who you're talking about.
"Because they're overstated. They made it through the Western conference during the peak years twice with curry at the helm. They beat Durant and westbrook because of currys stellar play at the end of that series.   The only player to successfully abuse switches onto curry is lebron James. Westbrook and harden tried and failed. Curry defended harden extremely well in 2018 and 2019 and westbrook wasn't able to exploit curry after the first few games of the series. So yeah there's basically no pg in the league who can lebron on switches, that's how he destroyed all those Eastern teams and put up historic offensive numbers during his Cleveland run.   Curry was the main dog in 2015, he deserved finals mvp but iggy got it ironically because of how good lebron was."
"Basketball Reference has some really interesting ones  Examples of nicknames on their website:  - LeBron ""The Little Emperor"" James  - Anthony ""Phatman"" Davis  - Bradley ""Blue Magic"" Beal  - Andre ""Big Penguin"" Drummond  - Joe ""Beef Jerky Joe"" Harris  - Terrence “Electroman” Ferguson  - Nemanja ""Professor Big Shots"" Bjelica  - Corey ""The Drunken Dribbler"" Brewer  - Marc ""Big Burrito"" Gasol  - Markelle ""Quick Wash” Fultz"
"&gt;""Kevin Durant is the best player on the planet. He's beaten LeBron James head-to-head in 2 Finals in which he was the Finals MVP; He's the best mid-range jump shooter we've seen since Jordan; He's been a candidate for DPOY and almost a 90% career FT shooter."""
"significantly more famous  if i asked my 65 year old ma today who lebron james is, she would know he's a basketball player, but no way she could pick him out of a lineup  if i asked my 65 year old grandma in 1996 who micheal jordan was, she would think i was mentally handicapped"
"Tmac not getting out of the first round was bad luck.  Was up 3-1 agaisnt the 04 Champion Pistons but couldn't close it out.  He and Yao were only healthy what I believe was one time together for a playoff run and got robbed in a 7 game series by the corrupt ref (forgot his name Daughtery or some shit).  Injuries obviously also plagued his entire career.  But when healthy Tmac &gt; Russ all day any day imo.  Russ dominates the ball and has a low b-ball iq.  His style of play dominates a box score but I don't see it translate into making his team more of a winner (at least not to the level of some people he's often said to be better than).    Hell, Lebron dominates the ball too being a point forward and his best statistical season was 30 - 8 - 7 compared to Russ' 31 - 10 - 11 but I don't think anyone would argue Lebron's style of play doesn't make his team better overall than say Russ who has had higher stat peaks.    I feel the same about the Dribbler James Harden too haha"
That kid grew up to be lebron james.
Emoni bates vs lebron James Jr
"How many players get the opportunity Irving did in playing next to LeBron James who handled the bulk of playmaking responsibilities. He's not even in the finals without him.  Even including those years, he doesn't have an all time level peak for the position. An awesome on ball scorer but is too limited as a playmaker."
"darko was supposedly a once in a lifetime player that would have been considered #1 overall if it wasn't already kind of obvious lebron james was already a man among boys. since the peaking pistons were picking 2 and had a full team they were talking the best available stash player over carmelo who they would have to retool the whole team around. It was, at the time, a smart move. granted they could have picked wade and shifted rip to a six and that would have been beastly but i kinda feel like wade wasn't expected to be as good as he was as quickly as he was, kind of a dark horse in that draft class.  its not as if a year later the pistons didn't lift a trophy anyway"
https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nba/players/full/1966.png  Here’s LeBron James. In his mid 30s and oh yeah his life is shitty alright lmao
LeBron James is 15th with 927 blocked shots
"Hello sir. The OP (Original Poster) is referring to the post which is about Kobe Bean Bryant's list which goes 1. Kobe Bean Bryant, 2. Michael Jeffrey Jordan, 3. LeBron Raymone James. Therefore I believe that 1st and 2nd actually refer to Kobe Bean Bryant and Michael Jeffrey Jordan, not Michael Jeffrey Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, or Michael Jeffrey Jordan and Lebron Raymone James. I hope that cleared up any confusion."
"I think your underrating both Durant and kyries play making. Durant became one of the best passing small forwards in the game on the warriors, and Irving also improved as a playmaker in boston. He was also great for us this year as a playmaker. He's not lebron James but he's an above average distributor for his position. Combine that with dinwiddie as our backup point guard to run the show and we have enough play making to get it done imo.   It's a somewhat similar to the clippers. They don't have any elite play makers but get by with kawhi, pg, and then lou Williams on the second unit.   I think levert will be the odd man out, but realistically he's being pushed out for Durant and kyrie, there's just no way that doesn't make us signficiantly better. We have enough good offensive role players around them that I see a top 5-7 offense as pretty likely. We will likely be one of the best 3pt shooting teams in the league with Harris, prince, durant, and kyrie.   Also decent chance we trade levert before the season stsrts.   I think the defensive concerns are fair. I'm not sure how we turn this team into a top 10 unit, preferably I hope we trade levert for a defensive minded 3+d player but idk do that will happen."
"&gt;Not playing anymore won't take that power away from them  Curious - I'm assuming you follow at least some NBA players on social media accounts.  How many years of basketball not existing would it take for you to no longer log in to check LeBron James' account, for example?  I don't closely follow any celebrity culture and Reddit is my only social media so I'm a bit of an outlier."
"Also one of only six players to average 27/7/7.  Luka Doncic (1), Michael Jordan (1), Russell Westbrook (2), John Havlicek (2), LeBron James (6), Oscar Robertson (6)"
"I think I’m putting him outside top 10 even though NBA math put him at 13 back in 2017. Their list only being based on TPA (Total Points Added). Assuming we’re throwing out **almost** everything before Bird. Which, ok I’ll go along with them included or not, I don’t care really.  Kareem (he can clearly stay) Bird Jordan Olajuwon Barkley Robinson Garnett Duncan O’Neal LeBron. Curry Kawhi arguably now too. Also arguably Magic Johnson Dirk and James Harden but we can leave them off and make 10 to clear some harder arguments. I’m still thinking even after commenting. KD Kobe Karl Malone. I’m not necessarily certain but we’re clear of 10 before any of them. TPA put Westbrook’s peak inside the top 10 which I disagree with and put clearly below Wade myself. His peak is high and across multiple regular seasons/playoffs so he still has avenue into top 25 but not clearway."
Yeah those 2nd trip Cavs teams could only loosely be called a “super team” if your definition for the term is “a team with LeBron James and other NBA players”
"Hmm??? Exactly — solidarity with the protestors, this movement is more important than this game. Black lives matter.  It’s this sort of argument that shows just his silly using the NBA as a voice for a movement that is much more radical than the NBA is so facetious.  “A brief history of black nationalism and it’s discontents, brought to you by Kevin Durant.” “James Baldwin and the question of self-determination — a children’s story by Steph Curry.” “From black nationalism to internationalism — the story of Malcolm X, narrated by Lebron James.” “Angela Davis — black radical or cointelpro plant — a discussion with Kyrie Irving.”  I’d love to see it, and I’m sure some NBA players are reading Baldwin (Trae and Jaylen I speculate ;)), but imagine Disney giving a serious platform to this movement."
EDIT: misread the article it says basketball IQ test but ill keep my comment so everyone knows how dumb I am  Right? Like you don't need extremely high traditional IQ to have amazing basketball IQ. Like Chris Paul and Lebron James have some of the smartest NBA minds of all time yet in interviews or media I never found them particularly genius level outside of basketball. Probably the best example of this is Magic Johnson.   Basically BBQIQ &gt; IQ
[It's more than that.](https://fadeawayworld.net/2018/12/25/the-media-lying-about-lebron-james-and-his-9-blocked-dunks/)
"The extra ring and MVP shouldn’t really offset KDs ridiculous longevity. Durant has so many runner up MVP places only to LeBron James, some of which I could argue were better seasons than Curry’s first MVP.   I don’t think that Warriors Thunder season matters much in terms of the two, it’s a team game.   And then there’s the fact that Durant has two FMVPS... that and longevity easily offsets the extra ring and MVP."
"Never forget that Skip said, on national televsion, ""LeBron James considers me his Howard Cosell.""  He is truly an insane person."
"You have to realize for every 1 Lebron James and KG, there’s 20 others that never made it to their potential. He’s only talking about skill and game knowledge, not talent level."
"Team A can't guard team B lol. There is no guarding LeBron James if he had Gasol, Melo, Klay, and Curry to kick it out to, and there is no guarding the Curry/Bron PnR. They could spam it every play and average over a point and a half per possession"
"Yeah, he is better than the greatest shooter of all time and 2 time MVP winner because he has the jump shooting of LeBron James now???? Why are you acting like LeBron is known for his shooting?"
"Top 3 player? Robertson was lucky to have top 100 players. Steph had 2 all-stars and a borderline all-star in his unluckiest year. Add kevin Durant, and he still has 2 all-stars and a borderline all-star plus you know, a friggin MVP potential player by his side.  Barkley literally had crap players his entire career and he carried them to a finals appearance. He was doubled just like Curry was, his team just couldn't bail him out like Curry's could.  And Durant had lebron James on him for both those finals. Not quite just ""one guy."" I really think that's an important distinction."
"[Kyrie has already ""used his platform.""](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/12/kyrie-irving-i-cant-breathe-t-shirt-before-cavaliers-eric-garner-lebron-james/nba-cleveland-cavaliers-at-brooklyn-nets-3#main#main)  It didn't work."
"He's not wrong either.  I think that reconciling the two is not incompatible, as Austin Rivers and LeBron James said.  It will help players with lower salaries as well."
"Keep in mind, this guy is younger than LeBron James."
"Of course he would take it back, doesn't mean he was in the wrong. No one wants to be responsible for losing their co-workers millions. Well unless that person had some balls and principles of steel but no one in the NBA has that. Certainly not LeBron James who actually supported China over Hong Kong."
"1. Yes, James Harden has all the scum tactics 2. Just different styles of play  3. Flashy teams are definitely the 2 LA teams, if you want to watch really good team ball, watch Denver, Utah and San Antonio  Teir 1: Lebron, KD, Kawhi, Curry, Giannis and maybe Harden although I think he belongs more in teir 2  Teir 2: Siakam, Tatum, Westbrook, Davis, Lillard, Jokic, Towns, Butler, Embiid, Irving, Doncic (for now), Wall (when healthy), Klay, Booker, Mitchell, Oladipo, Trae Young  Teir 3: Middleton, Aldridge, DeRozan, Lowry, Love,  Porzingis, CP3, Murray, Simmons, Adebayo, Ayton, Ingram, McCollum, Beal, Gobert, Gallinari, Adams, Tobias Harris, Horford, Brogdon, Capela,  John Collins, Vucevic  Probably forgot some but that's the best I can do"
"To quote Lebron James,  ""Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others, and you're only thinking about yourself. I don't want to get in a word sentence feud with kyrie Irving , but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke. And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually."""
Done more? Sure. Better? Absolutely fucking not shut the front door nephew this Lebron King of China James we are talking about.
"these comments are getting so dumb lmao  &amp;#x200B;  how are y'all turning another thread into a shit on Kyrie fest for saying they should think about all the options and also try to get more power in the players hands and go as far as ""YEAH AND HE NEEDS TO BE AS RESPECFUL AS LEBRON JAMES!!!!!!!!""?  &amp;#x200B;  it's like everyone got hella defensive when Kyrie suggested players think instead of jump right into Orlando because that doesn't = BASKETBALL'S BACK and now it's spiraled into everything about the situation (even a thread about ""HEY GUYS BASKETBALL IS GONNA BE FINE ITS OK) being a fuck kyrie thread  &amp;#x200B;  barely anyone is like Lebron, Duncan, Curry, CP3 etc. That's why they're so special. you trying to say that no one in the league is taken seriously if they heckle a fan? get out of here with that. Westbrook claps back all the time and does amazing shit off the court and is extremely well respected.  &amp;#x200B;  these guys have been dealing with this shit for years, decades even. if anything, it's more telling of how ""respectful"" most of you are when you go off the rails insulting a dude who just wants people to think about everything going on and weigh all the options in a time like this  &amp;#x200B;  (not going off on you in particular just skimmed through the  thread and this is where i ended up)"
"Where is LeBron James,it seems everyone waiting for him to speak and he is quiet."
"&gt;why you don’t like Luka, tell us?  I like Luka. I think he was def worthy of his top 3 pick in his draft class. I think the hype he gets is insane. He gets comparisons to Lebron and MJ etc. The other day I saw someone say he is Aang from Avatar lol. People say he is a generational player and the comparisons he gets is just crazy. There are already threads saying he will be a top 50 player of all time easily and I just don't see it and I think people are too enamored by the high USG% states and don't realize how good the rest of his team is.  &gt;He’s young, not hard to like,  Yes he is young, he was just drafted last year at his first year of eligibility. Youth is a great thing to have in a player or even in life in general. Not gonna disagree here.  &gt;surprisingly athletic  Not really, he is below average athletically and this is very much the case on defense.  &gt;nice crafty game. Great passer obviously.  Yes these are his two great skills. Passing, and crafty under the rim game. Everything else for the most part he is not good at except for accumulating high uncontested rebounds.  &gt;He shoots too much but that can be roped in over time with experience  He shot worse from 3 and FT% than Lebron James at the same age and James has never been considered a great 3 point shooter or FT shooter. Look at all the other high volume 3 point shooters and he sticks out as being the worst percentage of the bunch. You can't merely chalk it off the being young or high volume.  &gt;“empty stats” ....carry a team to  See this is a big reason why there is this big misconception on Luka. He isn't carry anything. His team is great statistically without him. For example his bench is ranked top 5 in the entire league (not just the west) and despite that he is only a 7th team in the west. If Luka was on the teams that Booker or Trae Young has been on, those teams would not have been any better."
"Intentionally missing the point doesnt make you sound clever. You disregarded my point that he spoke on the issue as if he was an expert to say  that he was put in peril. I said he was not in peril, the protestors in Hong Kong are in a way worse situation  than LeBron would have been put in. Also if one member of a sports association on the other side of the planet gives his dissenting opinion on something, and you feel it warrants considering that LeBron James could he put in ""peril"" then Morey's point was proven. The timing was not great but he isnt wrong for voicing his opinion."
"The sticking point for me is that this generational wealth is already going to these players.  You're just using capitalism to fight capitalism, which means you end up settling on the same tired solution that never works out, but with new faces.    Think about how much money is pumped into the NBA.  That money could solve a lot of problems, and help bring a lot of *poor* communities of any type out of poverty.  But that money is already there and it's not going towards those types of solutions.  So what do we do?  How do we prevent the profits from going to the already rich owners AND the already rich players?  Why would I think, for example, that Lebron James has any idea what it's like to be a disadvantaged black person in America when the dude has been a millionaire for almost more years than he hasn't?  He has no concept what ""normal"" looks like in America, from any perspective.  If the NBA Players Association cares about the plight of black Americans in this country, then why aren't they negotiating for a portion of the profits to be set aside and earmarked for a specific set of causes or initiatives that help bring some of those poor communities out of poverty?  But none of that happens, and in the end when a rich person talks about the social issues in our country, it rings flat.  Whether they're black or white or asian or hispanic or whatever fucking skin colour you want.  I mean jesus fucking christ, with all the money and talent and intelligence we have in this country, we can't come up with a better solution that what we already know doesn't work?  We can, we just don't value it, so we don't try."
Lebron James is fuming
"If you are talking about fans then who they really want are Lebron, KD, Steph, Klay, and James Harden.  All veterans.  Maybe a few young stars got some juice with a fanbase but the whole point is they haven't been around long enough in the league to be speaking for others, ESPECIALLY dudes that have been in longer."
*this advertisement has been funded and brought to you by LeBron James
"It's true that they wouldn't have their platform without basketball, but they already HAVE their platform, many of which have become bigger than the platform that playing basketball on TV provides (statistically speaking).   If the NBA striked, do you not think ESPN would block out an hour of programming for some well-known players to come in and discuss the strike? Do you not think every single left-of-right podcaster in the world would want to have LeBron fucking James on to discuss voter suppression? Yes, basketball is the reason they are popular, but a temporary suspension of basketball does not immediately erase their popularity. We're literally living the proof right now.   &gt; Also who besides Dwight Howard is supporting Kyrie? Literally every other player that has spoken out wants to play. Why are you so against them playing? LeBron is speaking out too and has a lot more support, why is his view somehow less relevant to you?  How about Stephen Jackson, personal friend of George Floyd and man who's been on the front lines of this movement since day one?  I totally get that a bunch of millionaire players would like to make millions of dollars as opposed to not making millions of dollars. I'd also get it if the players striked and an owner decided he wanted out because he didn't want to deal with a bunch of uppity players demanding he use his limitless resources and connections to lobby for political candidates and policy [like they already do all the time](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2017/06/among-nba-owners-betsy-devoss-father-law-tops-donors/). I don't think any owner is going to do that, though.  The majority of players disagreeing with Kyrie doesn't influence my opinion at all. I think he's coming from a place of genuine activism and most of them are coming from a place of ""I don't want to give up a check"", so I support Kyrie."
"No, they wouldn't be able to use the playoff bubble as a larger platform. The networks are and will be in charge of editing, interview length, and so forth and so on.  Additionally, there are only a handful of guys in the league that I'd even trust to get in front of a camera to explain to the uninitiated, what it is that the Black community would like to put out there. James aint even on the top of that list, but his voice is necessary for obvious reasons.  So the players come out onto the courts with t-shirts w/ messages. Soon as they take them off, it's over and done with. They kneel, the camera cuts to a commercial but not before it finds LeBron James and other notables.  Property and Money are what Americans covet. Corporations DO NOT LISTEN unless there is profit to be loss or gained. If the players said, ""No"", and the season was cancelled, it would send a message to the Board of Governors--they could use this as leverage.  Yes, it sacrifices future earnings but that is the definition of sacrifice. Between all of those players, there's enough, collectively between them, to ensure that NONE of their peers or their families go hungry (As absurd as even typing that out sounds).  Agents are going to agent. The bigger the contract, the more they get.  Kap bit the bullet; he demonstrated what it takes to make change. Ali, sacrificed. Leaders of the past, who in most cases knew they were going to die, sacrificed their lives for the \*\*advancement\*\* of change. Think about that shit. They knew they weren't going to be able to reap the benefits, and still, they continued on.  And here we are, wringing our hands because a dude might make 79 Mill instead of 100+??  I end my soapbox rant to say, fuck Stephen A Smith. If I could just have J. Williams and Max on a show, uninterrupted, I'd tune in more often. Shit, I'd take Will Cain and Bomani too."
" To quote Lebron James,  ""Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others, and you're only thinking about yourself.

"Not under appreciated. Just coincided with Giannis blowing up. My opinion of Harden is much higher due to his past 2 seasons. Who’s opinion hasn’t changed? I mean back in 2014 I legit thought I’d rather have Klay at SG than James. Harden is having an incredible peak. A HOF with a peak so blazing that if he never wins a ring he may be the best player to never win one. People love Morey and Dantoni but they have failed James (Mchale also) by not putting together a team that can win. And no I don’t think the 2018 rockets for sure beat LeBron if they got through the warriors. And either way you build a team to maximize your window, pursuing Chris Paul was not doing that due to injury and age. If harden had a better team and system around him I doubt he averages 36. But I think he would’ve won a ring by now. From his first year in Houston till now he’s absolutely good enough to lead a championship team.  And I am absolutely a harden hater. I rewatch old playoff games to just watch James lose, that spurs series, games against warriors. But harden has put on a fucking show these last 2 seasons, and even I tip my hat and enjoy the fireworks from time to time. Harden is an all time great."
"If you think a tweet by Daryl Morey will have severe financial ramifications for the league, imagine what Lebron James speaking out would have done. It’s not just about him, it would affect guys pockets for years to come. I don’t think enough people think about that. He was damned if he did or didn’t speak out against China."
This answer was in the context of the question: How much would another championship help LeBron James in the GOAT debate?
A less talented NBA core would not produce the same amount of revenue pal.   The machine absolutely does not create the popularity.   Remove the machine around it and people would still want to watch LeBron James.  Feel like I'm talking to Arthur Laffer or something.
"&gt; I'm not missing that, because shutting the league down makes the NBA platform disappear  The league's been shut down for 3 months and we're in a thread with 900+ comments discussing an Ed Davis quote. 46 million people follow Lebron James on Twitter compared to &lt;1 million that watch an average NBA game, and most of those people watching games are WATCHING GAMES and not sticking around for players to get their 2 minutes to speak on social justice afterwards. If anything, [more people care about what NBA players do off the court than on it](https://www.si.com/johnwallstreet/sports-business/social-grows-nba-viewership-decline).  &gt; Also, do you think Kyrie would be pushing for this if KD was healthy and they had a shot at winning a title this year?  Ah yes, the classic ""They don't actually believe in the causes they're preaching"" tactic backed by nothing but your anonymous speculation. Never thought Fox News would be bleeding into r/NBA but here we are."
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/us/politics/lebron-james-voting-rights.html
"LeBron: “Yeah, now that’s what I like to hear!..... Jeeves, could you get me another one of those caviar tacos? On a gold plate this time? Thanks!”  Jeeves: “My name is Willi-.... right away, Mr. James.”"
"Not really though.   If you were to swap Trae Young and Lebron James, the Hawks would still suck."
Like were they Lebron James finals MVPs or like a Iggy Fmvp
"Contests per game for 3s? A tracking stat that we know are inconsistent? The same stat that good defenders like LeBron James, KCP, Patrick Beverly, Torrey Craig  Jon Isaac, Thybulle, Caruso Chris Paul, and even a DPOY candidate Ben Simmons, rank even lower than Westbrook?   If I extended the list to great defenders under Gobert, it looks even more crazy.   He’s a good defender and a great one when he wants to be. Using the series against y’all isn’t exactly a great argument. Dame shot poorly on shots being guarded by him. The inability to trap from the bigs were our downfall, not Westbrook’s defense."
"&gt; Frankly, I feel that this is informed by me being an outside to the US. Sports should not resume until it is safe to do so with the players being able to go about their normal lives.   I am from outside the US as well (Germany) , but what is safe? what is normal? There won't probably be normal until 2021. So no sports until then? When it comes to safety, being in a place where they are regularly tested seems safer to me than going to the grocery store or what else no?  Here in Germany soccer has been back for almost a month now, with no one catching the virus. Spain is back, England this week and even Italy started soccer back again in a place which was the epicentrum of the pandemic at one point.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; no one here would agree they want to spend 3 months in a disneyland hotel room (after having just spent months in a lockdown) without their friends and family, being bought out occasionally for peoples entertainment.   They won't be spending 3 months away from family man. They will leave mid july for Orlando, and after the 2nd round family is allowed to visit. So what, tops 4 weeks without family? No need to exaggerate.  And they are not 'brought out' simply for people's entertainment, its also their job you know? their livelyhood depends on it. Not everyone of these players makes Lebron James' money to be secured for the rest of their lives.  Not even talking about the financial impact that will occur in the following 10 years if they don't play. So I don't think joy is 'essentialy' the barometer here."
"When I re-watch that LeBron James performance from Game 5 of that 2007 Eastern Conference Finals series, one of the crazy things is that James *had* to score 29 of his team's last 30 points. Had he missed one of those faders or failed to convert even one of those layups or dunks (scoring, say, only 27 of his team's last 29), the Pistons probably would have won.   So when I see those moments where Jason Maxiell's trying in vain to step over and help in the paint, I *do* wonder from time to time what the result would have been had Ben Wallace still been in Detroit, assuming he could have anticipated at least one of those drives to force a kick-out or tough finish (instead of, you know, uncontested dunks).   That said, Chicago was willing to pay *big* money (at the time) for a 31-year-old dude with no offensive game who was already showing some gentle hints of decline, so it's hard to blame any party involved for how things shook out."
So you don’t think LeBron James is a much better player than Kyrie? Just the calls?
"or you know. the league leveraged him to stfu.. the worst pr response? his answer wasnt even bad, people just blew it out of context and proportion because he is Lebron. and how about literally every single other player coach exec etc. or literally 99% of the world? why is Lebron James the only fucking person getting shit for this. Its just beyond surreal for me."
"Not really dude. It's the same pedantic bullshit that gets played out again and again to make these celebrities look the same as us.  This sub is so full of bullshit hero worship that they cant see the truth around the ten inch dick their sucking.   Like this comment. Shit like this has been said time and time again about lebron. It was said especially frequently during the hong kong protests and Lebrons reaction to them.  Many commenters complained about the frequent Hong Kong posting and complaining, ""why should lebron make a statement? This shit doesnt affect him.""/ ""you wouldnt risk your job to help china, so why should lebron?""  I HATE that shit. I hate when fans place fans on the same level as these guys. We aren't. We cant do any shit. It doesnt matter if you or I say something about China, it wont be heard outside our neighborhoods. Lebron James would be heard on fucking mars.  And this goes beyond politics and lebron. I feel the same for Kevin durant going to the Ws. Everytime people post shit bout KD, you always get one bullshit commenter chiming in, ""hey it's a job to him! Shouldn't you be allowed to move locations if you want""  As if kevin Durant's moving did not affect millions upon millions of people and him switching jobs is fundamentally different than me switching from taco bell to KFC.  It is just my opinion, and I know it's an opinion, that when you have a certain amount of power and influence, you need to be responsible with that power and influence and wield it smartly.  As uncle ben said, with great power comes great responsibility.  KD had a huge amount of power in his decision to switch teams, but felt he had no responsibility: to his fans, to OKC, to the league, to his fellow players, to anyone. So he made the selfish decision.  Lebron james has a huge amount of power. Like astronomical. He is probably in the top 20 most powerful people in the USA. His responsibility to speak up and talk and respond is so drastically different than me or you or anybody on r/nba.  So when I see a comment like, lebron james is exactly like r/nba. I get frustrated. I get frustrated that the illusion is working and that these ultra rich millionaires and billionaires are masquerading as common folk and all us idiots will do is eat up.   So yeah. You were probably right. I am just an angry old man yelling at the screen. I just wish people realize that the world changes when you have power and influence. Your role changes."
"LeBron James in the 2011 NBA Finals. It would be one thing if he was playing bad, but man he wasn’t aggressive at all during that series. It was most prevalent in Game 4; LeBron had *8 points on 11 field goal attempts*, compared to Wade and Bosh’s 20 and 19 attempts."
"Tell me where in this statement LeBron said that Morey's statements lost him money?  &gt; ""I don’t want to get in a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey. But I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke,"" James said before the Lakers’ preseason game against the Golden State Warriors on Monday at Staples Center. ""So many people could have been harmed, not only physically or financially, but emotionally and spiritually. Just be careful what we tweet, what we say and what we do. We do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative things that come with that too.""   Or this one  &gt; Let me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet.  I’m not discussing the substance.  Others can talk About that.   Or this one  &gt; My team and this league just went through a difficult week.  I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others.  And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen.  Could have waited a week to send it.   I'm having trouble here, I'm only seeing one mention to the word ""financially"". Did he have a statement that I missed?"
"the problem with this is the fact that there are instances where, players that didnt win a FMVP actually outperformed players that did win. For example, in 2013 LeBron james won finals mvp against the spurs. He averaged 25/8/6 that entire playoff run. In contrast, in 2001, Kobe did not win finals mvp, however he averaged 29/7/6 throughout the playoff run. The WCF finals was considered the REAL finals back then as there were various teams superior to the 76ers team that actually made the finals. Notably the spurs. Kobe was the MVP of the WCF series against them. Kobe averaged 33/7/7 that series. Given these circumstances I dont see how bron winning finals mvp in 2013 make his ring anymore valuable. Kobe performed at a higher level throughout the playoff run. Its a talking point that never really added up."
"And I'm saying that's a stupid ass comparison:  (1) cause its straight up false seeing as this sub was crazy vocal about Hong Kong. So unless the majority of this sub is Chinese, this statement isnt true.  (2) even if it were true, it wouldn't fucking matter, because this sub cant do any fucking change other than be vocal and shit. Nobody cares if this subreddit is vocal about shit, but people care when lebron James. So this sub not speaking up about things that dont affect them is not as big a deal as lebron james"
"FMVP is too small of a sample size and too dependent on matchups to be given such importance by fans. It's also funny because NO ONE, and I mean no one talked about FMVP as an important award until LeBron got 2. Because in the ever tiring LeBron/Kobe debates this meant they were now even cause a ring only counts if you got FMVP.    Before people started arguing that FMVP was just the cherry on top of a great season but no one tried to make the argument that Magics rings with the Lakers don't count cause James Worthy got finals MVP. Or Larry Bird with Dennis Johnson.  Tony Parker got an FMVP with the Spurs but that doesn't seem to make anyone think he was a greater player than he was.  Danny Green was a missed Ray Allen 3 pointer from winning FMVP.   Then you have Andre Igoudala.   It's way too random cause anyone can get hot or be an x factor for 3-4 games.  Being the best player on a championship team is what matters, whether or not that player wins FMVP."
Lebron James  The Avengers
LeBron James and Zodiac.
"&gt; About the stat you referenced I don't have the time to look up how it's calculated but it's really weird to give a low rating to players who were top 5 in mvp voting.  It isn't perfect but it is one of the few stats we have that isn't based on box scores. Lebron James has been positive every single year in on/off and most years he was +10&gt;. Giannis every year has been positive especially last 3 years. It really passes the eye test for the most part and check out players like [Monta Ellis](https://www.cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/1043/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) and [Bargnani](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/177/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) and compare with [Lebron](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/1785/onoff#tab-team_efficiency). The narrative that Luka has of someone who is some all generational talent and ""best 20 year old ever"" carrying a bad team you expect him to have an an/off of something crazy like +15. This isn't the case and his team is barely better with him statistically when he is on the court. To me that is shocking when you compare that with the narrative."
Any top 10 player not already 7ft. Imagine a 7ft LeBron James.
The cops killed a relatively unknown man and got 3 week protests and riots but you think they would touch Lebron James? He’s never getting touched by a cop.
Pretty sure the dems would win if LeBron James is going up against Trump
1) Jerry West   2) Bill Russell  3) Elgin Baylor (for now)  4) George Mikan  5) LeBron James  6) John Havlicek   7) Oscar Robertson   8) Bob Cousy   9) Bob Pettit  10) Draymond Green (I have no clue who tf that other guy is)
LeBron James
Yes bc China woulda detained Lebron James. Waiting to make a statement till you left the country is such a crazy move no wonder he didn’t think of it.
"I still believe the finals that the cavs beat the warriors was rigged. I honestly wish ayesha hadn’t come out and said it because more people thought so before she said anything. Besides the techincals and curry ejection, there’s one thing that I’ll never get over....  James Michael Mcadoo guarding lebron. He was only ever used in garbage time all season. Even in blowouts. He was kept off the roster most games as well. Suddenly, he’s starting and coming in like 2nd q to guard Lebron. I didn’t see it as “oh the warriors need height in Lebron”. He was benched all year. Then suddenly is part of the big 5 right when the warriors are gonna sweep. It was for more airtime to get to 7 games. The winner doesn’t matter imo"
"LeOverrated James and that account are easily the worst on NBA twitter, though I have to give the crown to LeOverrated James for saying he wants LeBron to tear his Achilles multiple times"
Lazy LeBron James and Awful Anthony Davis are by far the worst duo in the NBA! THE WORST!
"I could have worded it better. I’m not blaming the individual officials for calling these fouls, I think the rulebook itself is flawed. It’s a really tricky issue to navigate, but players shouldn’t be making non-basketball plays to benefit from the rules. There is a difference between crafty vet plays or getting into a guys head to draw a foul, and what Manu is doing here.   He is exploiting the criteria on which fouls have to be called, and doing something with 100% sole intent of getting a foul call. The refs obviously know what he is doing, and what Davis is doing, but the standards for that particular foul call were met so they have to blow the whistle. The rules need to change so this isn’t as big of an issue. The fines for flopping helped but didn’t do a lot.  I mean that’s the entire basis of James Harden being the most hated on superstar today. Idk why I’m being downvoted so much. When Lebron or cp3 does this we make fun of them and say they should just play the game and quit the sissy contact seeking bullshit. When someone like Manu or Kyle Lowry does it we applaud them."
"Because it is hypocritical and inherently racist to value your ""own community"" over people in general. Police brutality is just as much as an issue as is the racial apartheid and injustices in Israel and the systemic dehumanization of all sorts of people by the CCP, including their own ethnic ""community"" in regards to Hong Kong. LeBron showed he cared more about money than the suffering of ethnic Chinese people in Hong Kong (and that's not even scratching the surface of the actions taken by the CCP) yet when it was his own ""tribe"" at the center of the issue, suddenly it's important.  People are people and because James valued the security and growth of his own wealth over the humane treatment of people under CCP rule, he doesn't really care about people. Because he doesn't care about the people being abused by the CCP, I'm guessing he also doesn't care about the Palestinians being dehumanized by Israel. None of these issues outweigh the other because they are all issues of human rights. Unless of course you think it's justifiable to value your own racial community more than another."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
Lmao. Brace yourself for the wokescolding by fans of social justice heroes like LeBron James or Steve Kerr.
"With the game slowed down, IN the Half court SPECIFICALLY:  Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving  Kemba Walker  Chris Paul   LeBron James"
"Lmao.  You think the police are going to kill LeBron James?  They might as well just kill themselves and the rest of their department too while they're at it, because if they killed LeBron every PD in the country would be burned within a day."
LeBron James is Pocahontas.
"The worldwide reaction has proven that Black Lives Matter but only in America because nobody is out here trying to end genocide in West Papua for example. European soccer teams putting BLM on their jerseys and taking a knee for ending racism and injustice while accepted offensive amounts of Middle Eastern and Chinese human riots violating money, just like the NBA and Lebron James. Then Americans have the nerve to say ""we gotta help our own first and not worry about what happens elsewhere"" while accepting supporting from the entire world."
"&gt;It is not surprising that Zydrunas Ilgauskas is number one on the list being the recipient of 785 assists considering he was LeBron's best teammate for 8 years during his first stint in Cleaveland.   Not only that but Ilgauskas' skillset fit wonderfully with Lebron. He was big enough to roll but his jumper was butter when he popped for Lebron. He even got a bit of three range late in his career.  Love's also not surprising given how some defenses reacted against Lebron when he didn't have a big man that could shoot that well (look at that game against Miami in James' last season in Cleveland.)  I'm more surprised at Varejao making it than at Gooden (or Parker who was a great forgotten role player or Booby who knew their roll and run for it), tbh. Gooden is so underrated but, like Ilgauskas, could pop like there was no tomorrow."
"&gt; I think LeBron proved with the China stuff that he cares just as much about his money and legacy  The NBA and LeBron are completely ruined in my eyes after the Hong Kong/Morey situation. There's no coming back from that. To think, just months after James went after Morey, videos started to leak throughout China of the police in China welding people into their homes in order to enforce Coronavirus quarantine, and who can forget about the likes of Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin going missing after the first wave of lockdowns in China."
"Nah  &gt;	LeBron James believes Rockets general manager Daryl Morey was ""misinformed and not educated on the situation"" when he tweeted in support of anti-government protestors in Hong Kong. ""I don't want to get into a ... feud with Daryl but I believe he wasn't educated about the situation at hand and he spoke,"" James told reporters on Monday ahead of the Lakers' preseason game against the Warriors. ""So many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually. ""Just be careful what we tweet ... even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech,"" he added. ""But there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too."""
And i’m sitting trying to find the knicks pitch to Lebron James with James Gandolfini
This is why Lebron James is the greatest basketball player of all time
"I'll bet you in LeBron James and other high profile players started you kneel that ban would go away real fucking quick.  And isn't that the point of a protest? The sit ins during the civil rights movements were banned to. What Rosa Parks did was also banned. That's a pretty, piss poor excuse not to do something if you ask me especially when it comes to justice for all people."
"I love you but please write down Lebron James on a piece of paper and fold it up. Throw in a fire and repeat to yourself three times, the bad man is gone. You boomed him 3x."
Kevin Harlan: “LEBRON JAMES WITH GREAT REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE!”
"""Two weeks into the season, Kelker invited his new star player to live with him. He wanted more stability for James, and he also wanted to make sure his best player continued to show up for games. When Gloria said she felt uncomfortable having her son move in with a virtual stranger, Kelker invited her to come too. He already had a live-in girlfriend, Kelker said; he promised Gloria that his only interest was in helping take care of her son.

Wouldn’t a truly “woke” Lebron James get Nike to move manufacturing of his shoes to Africa?   Why do basketball shoes that are popularized by predominately African Americans have to be made in Vietnam or China and not in Africa? I know most African countries don’t have the infrastructure in place but guess what they never will if no one takes a stand. Sure shoe manufacturing is menial labor and light industry but this is the same phase Japan went through. Previously japan was know for making inferior technology now they are a leader in manufacturing and technology. Imagine being the athlete that sparks a manufacturing revolution in a whole continent and lifts the lives of millions of poor. that far outweighs any championships you could win.
"What is this even supposed to fucking mean?  What can /r/nba affect? Please enlighten me. This is a subreddit of 3 million disparate people who have never met 99.99999% of the otehr subscribers that come together to watch and talk basketball.  We arent some monolith. We are a bunch of random people with no real organization or power. So realistically all /r/nba can do is be vocal because they have no real power to affect change.  Lebron James is fucking LEBRON JAMES. He could sneeze and its fucking news.  This entire subreddit as a collective probably has less money than Lebron James.  Lebron James has more power and influence than any single fucking person on this sub. He has the ability to affect change on far greater levels than any other singular NBA player, let alone a bunch of basketball nerds behind keyboards.  So this comparison is fucking dumb."
"I would have said LeBron for 2006 over either of them. Kobe was 35/5/4.5 on 45% shooting, James was 31/7/6.6 on 48%. James won in most of the advanced stats too. Kobe was nuts, but not clear and away the MVP nuts"
"Daryl Morey publicly called out Chine for their human rights abuses to which LeBron  then said :  “On Tuesday evening, James said it was his belief that Morey was “either misinformed or not really educated on the situation”"
Lol Beverly is a fucking bum. Lebron James is part of the reason he’s able to sign a $10M contract. His game ugly and he’s way overrated.
"1. LeBron is a hypocrite but, as a Chinese man who hates the CCP for just about all the reasons one could possibly hate the CCP for, I don't blame him. LeBron James has not power to change the situation in Hong Kong, no matter what he says. What he can do is make people's lives *here* better, and one way he's done that has been with money, and this means that the pragmatically moral choice, no matter how passionate he actually was about Hong Kong, was to do his best to shut it down. He looked like an idiot doing so, he could be totally disingenuous, selfish, facetious, or whatever else, but his overall impact on society has pretty much always been a positive one and we shouldn't be so quick to crucify him (as much as Reddit comments can actually crucify a person) when there's clearly a lot more in conflict here than his bank account and his belief in telling the truth.   2. There is almost nobody outside of the NBA who should judge what Kyrie, Dwight Howard, and anyone else are saying right now about shutting down the season, especially if they do it for protest. These are grown men and many of them came from the very situations that people are protesting about right now. For the record, I really dislike Kyrie; he's wrong about a lot of things and he's a terrible ambassador for the game in so many ways, but he's still allowed to be judged fairly for his opinions, and he's even allowed to be right. So if the players come together and the majority of them decide to shut the season down in protest then, while I hope there are measures taken to protect the lower level guys financially, none of us should pretend to be able judge or criticize that decision for any reason except that we're kind of bummed out that we're not getting more basketball after all."
I’m not mad about him not fighting other injustices. I’m mad because he implicitly supports and makes money off the Chinese government(who engage in voter suppression and a whole lot worse). He’s a hypocrite.  More info: https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2019/10/17/lebron-james-nike-china-revenue/3989915002/
Did LeBron James fuck Patrick's wife or something? He really hates Bron.
No. Patrick Beverly has studied the game and concluded that if Lebron James wants to play they must all play.
"LeBron James is the most coddled superstar in NBA history.  His talent is crazy off the charts, but he is so mentally fragile and cannot step up to pressure.  The only times I can say that he really stepped up to the challenge was The Stare game against Boston and his legendary Game 1 against the Warriors aka the JR Smiff Game.  Every other time that he accomplished something great was when there were no expectations on him.  How you gonna be the second greatest player of all time and be considered an underdog that often?  Another thing, he gets too much credit in terms of regular season MVPs.  The duo of Kobe and Shaq only produced one MVP because they were deemed ""too good"".  Yet LeBron bamboozled the media into thinking that his Miami Heat teams weren't just as great.  Bruh he had D-Wade and Chris Bosh in their primes!"
"The translation is ""We can protest up to a point but that man Lebron james is about his money over all else so get ready to go to work."""
"&gt; A persecuted group of people don't have enough of a voice to fight against injustices they themselves face, and you expect them to rise up and fight for other groups.  Fair point.  Can I just counter, though, that, maybe, it isn't expecting too much of Lebron James to, you know, show solidarity with the people of Hong Kong who are facing real oppression, rather then thinking about how much money he would lose on Space Jam 2 should be speak out?    The tweet Lebron made about Daryl Morey's tweet on Hong Kong is the entire problem: Lebron is a hypocrite, when its HIS wallet at stake.  It completely undercuts every single thing he's ever said on race.    If you want to talk about lack of self awareness or perspective, where was Lebron when China came for Hong Kong?  If Lebron's fight against oppression is that selective, then why can't America also be selective in which oppression we choose to care about?"
"*See James, LeBron*"
"I believe with all my heart, that Lebron James is the greatest player of all time."
"None of that is on the NBA.    You could say the same thing about competitive video games, or people trying to become instragram famous.  A lot of impressionable young people neglect building useful life skills to focus on get-rich-quick schemes. But at least with the NBA, a lot of them actually do get rich.  And even if they don't become Lebron James, there are a lot of stable jobs in coaching/training for former athletes.  If the NBA withers and dies, that's not going to inspire young black kids to become programmers and surgeons instead.  That's just a pure loss with no gain.  The NBA directly pays billions of dollars each year to black Americans and gives black people a global platform to say virtually whatever they want.  That's an incredibly valuable asset for the black community."
You think the police are going to kill *LeBron James?* Might as well just say they want to disband.
The last time we saw Steph in the finals before kd he choked  This time in 2019 in the finals Steph was outplayed by klay in game 2 and game 4 and in game 6 by Klay AND iggy. Steph got a taste of what james harden/LeBron and every other team he’s faced in the playoffs had to deal with.  Curry in the elimination game 21/3/7 on 35/28/100 splits
Lebron James is a better athlete than he is basketball player
"Lebron didn't ""just"" criticize Daryl Morey for supporting the HK protests. He also pressed for the NBA commissioner Adam Silver to punish Morey for standing up in their defense. Source: https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/10/16/report-lebron-james-pressed-adam-silver-on-daryl-morey-repercussions-perceived-double-standard-for-players/  Thats why I was laughing at Chappeles talk the other day. Said LeBron is a good man that stand up for rights. Lmao"
"Depends on a lot of factors. Obviously first is his ability at that time. Hed be either already 40 or almost 40 when his contract is up with the Lakers, so if he can still play like he is now, then he’s good to go anywhere. Next factor is if Bronny makes the league and if so, where does he go? Third factor is championship capability. Bron isn’t about to go start a rebuild at 40 years old, he might as well ride it out with the lakers at that point. Fourth factor is market. I could only ever see him going back to Cleveland IF he left the lakers tbh, and it would only be for a farewell season. Now that is a plausible idea because the cavs suck and probably won’t be getting better any time soon, so it highly possible that they could end up landing Bronny in the draft in 4 years which would be a perfect homecoming. Bronny does like Lebron and is a hometown draft pick, Bron comes home and MAYBE they win Bron one last chip together, solidifying his place in the annals of Cleveland sports. But realistically, he’ll retire with the lakers and force a trade for his son there on draft night. But never on gods green earth would Lebron James subject himself to the trash fire that is the New York Knicks"
"A lot of players, on all levels, could make significantly higher impacts defensively than they ever do if they were to allow the offensive side of their game to take a back seat. It's just, most people don't want to sacrifice that portion of their game (and in many cases they shouldn't, since teams need to score).  I don't know if LeBron would turn into Ben Wallace, but a guy like James *only* focusing on non-scoring endeavors could still be a borderline dominant force. In terms of being a rim protector, I'd wonder about his standing reach and two-footed no-step vert though.  Ben Wallace didn't have big hands but he did seem to have long arms for his height, which helped compensate for his relative lack of size. He was also primarily a two-footed jumper, which helped with shot blocking and contesting in the half court. James *can* jump off two feet but he seems to be most comfortable going off one. That alone may make their impacts as rim protectors quite different."
"It’s me, LeBron James and you’re watching Disney channel"
James Harden beating LeBron-Anthony Davis &amp; Kawhi-PG to lose to Giannis-Middleton would be something lmao.
Harden could have beat the Warriors if CP3s hamstring didn’t get injured. He’s the closest to beating a full power Warriors team of any player not named Lebron James.
It will still be Lebron James
Lebron James
Replace Lebron James Heat years with the best player in 60 years from now. How many rings does that player win?
SB Nation 7th  https://www.sbnation.com/2017/9/18/16175476/nba-player-rankings-top-100-2017-lebron-james  Washington Post 8th  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/sports/nba-top-100-players-2017/  BR 9th  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2737803-nba-player-rankings-top-100-players-before-2017-18-season-tips-off.amp.html   These are just the top 3 results when doing a lazy Google on the 2017-2018 season.   I don't know why you're getting hung up on something that I'm making clear is my opinion.
"Would you believe that sports stars - people who have devoted their entire lives to a very specific and generally *physical* skill set - don’t know what the fuck they’re talking about? Same goes for basically all celebrities. Movie stars might be well-spoken well-read but they’ve spent their entire adult lives studying *art*, not science or philosophy or economics or government.  LeBron James is free to do and say and contribute as he sees fit, and there’s no doubt he is a good person with a desire to help others, but his expertise is basketball. Tom Hanks can do all that but his expertise is theater. And so on and so forth.  The only real idiots in this situation are the fans who actually *listen* to celebrities as if they’re experts at anything beyond their chosen career. Go ahead and ask me how to fly a plane but don’t ask me how to reunite the fucking Korean Peninsula, you feel me? Anything I’ve got to say on that is merely an opinion."
"Yeah, it's pretty insane to think the top seed, who has LeBron James and Anthony Davis, is going to lose in **5 games** to a team missing multiple players who is below .500. I'm a homer, but that's crazy.  Blazers in 6."
"Can I be a LeBron fanboy and state a case for LeBron?  First time a guy lead the series on all 5 stats points/rebounds/assists/blocks and steals....  I have no word for that.  I get that you should give to the winners, but LeBron moved mountains to get that and deserved some credibility.  They have given Jerry West a FMVP even though he lost and he didn't do as much as LeBron (ok, he hit a full court shot to go to overtime, but talking about the whole series, not a moment).  Anyway, I think it was a moment that made history. Glad that he repeated the feat on the next year and got the trophy.  I also prefered his season in compared to D-Rose. He got so much hate from going to Miami and affect the ballots. It was much nicer to give it to d-rose, but I disagree.  And maybe to keep with the trend, kkkk, a Defensive player award would also be nice. Maybe the 2012-13 season when Gasol won. https://www.hothothoops.com/2013/4/24/4263324/how-marc-gasol-beat-lebron-james-for-dpoy  There was a time that his defense was legit and all people could talk about was he was the only one guarding the 5 positions. It is the *one* trophy he never got in his career and he said he wanted that."
"I think AD is the type of player where if youll put him in an already good team, he'll make the team even better but if a team is barely good then he doesn't have much of an impact.    Imo id say that skillwise, AD is a top 5 player, he has dpoy caliber defense and a versatile offensive game topped with insane athleticism for his size. Compare this to (regular season) LeBron, who mostly works on the offensive end making plays and passes, and is quite lazy on defense.    With james and without AD, the lakers seem to be a playoff contender but if its the other way around, the team just seems... Meh. However, with both of them on the team, the lakers are championship contenders, because AD's skillset turns an already capable playoff contending team over the top, to a championship contending team."
"Tatum jerks off with his left hand to photos of Lebron James, same as Lebron James"
"Jayson Tatum is playing basketball, a sport that LeBron James is playing too."
"In that same vein, guys like Chris Paul, Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, and Tim Duncan were all getting MVP votes early in their careers as well. If you want to talk about specific age groups, I get it, but there will always be outliers. The best of the best."
It's really sad to see him now. He was a player that could be traded alone for LeBron James. 1 for 1. And now he's a fucking clown. He's said something along the lines of wanting to make everyone happy but this is just sad.  Imagine if he had better work ethic.
"I mean realistically, it is close to impossible. Are you gonna count on Anthony Davis to give a Leonard or James-esque scoring performance to save the team’s chances in a playoff situation when everyone else is shitting the bed and defenses are keyed in? Maybe you would, but I’d be super nervous about giving that responsibility to a dude who can barely handle a double team or reliably score beyond 10 feet.  If Davis was truly the MVP level player some claim, there’s no reason the Lakers should be straight up awful without LeBron when they play just fine vice versa. Holding the team’s head above water while the other star rests should be the bare minimum expected of him."
Then year later you sign LeBron James
Reminds me of the early years of Lebron James in Cleveland. Solid help but nobody to really help take the load off consistently
"A generation is generally defined as 20 years. Generational talents: NBA history:  Lebron James: 2003-2020  Michael Jordan: 1984-1998  Kareem: 1969-1989  Wilt: 1958-1973  These were the best talents of their generation. The next generational talent is probably Giannis, but an argument could be made for Luka. Trae is not in that discussion. Don’t cheapen it. You can maybe call him a once a decade point guard, but a generational talent is one talent per generation. The mt Rushmore of the nba."
Oh ight cuz I thought a dude who roots for a team that missed the playoffs with *LeBron James* said sum
"Well ya know, we're all just uneducated on the situation. High school diploma holder LeBron James will set us straight.   Daryl Morey is a more patient man than I'll ever be."
"Yeah I’m not saying they are all lebron james.   But people under estimate the “non”athletic nba players. Once got into in argument because someone was listing nba guys who can’t dunk  It was like: Lowry, Conley, trae, FVV, and a few other guys but no, they are athletic is hell  I guess even for Jokic. It’s a different type of athletic but he’s still way more athletic, cardio/ strength whatever than most of regular society"
"https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/467295-uighurs-china-and-the-lucrative-hypocrisy-of-lebron-james-nba  Glad he's recognizing John Lewis, but he's not the best messenger. I'll be more interested in LeBron's opinion on civil rights and social justice when he takes a stance in opposition to Uighur ""re-education"" camps."
LeBron James
"I'm a Minnesota Timberwolves fan, but I don't recommend selecting them. In the NBA, individual players can be major difference makers, and it isn't easy to convince star players to come play on a usually mediocre team that is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota during the winter months.   On kind of a side note, I think Timberwolves is one of the coolest team names and during the KG (Kevin Garentt) era, we really were the real deal and came close.   Because I know the Timberwolves don't have a shot at the championship title, I have picked other teams to root for. I have always gravitated to LeBron James. He is the most fun player to watch currently, in my opinion, and watching him in the playoffs has become 'must watch' sports for me for basically the last decade or so. So that said, the NBA team I root for to win the championship is currently the Lakers.  More recently, the rookie Zion Williamson has shown some pretty unique talent. I think with him and a lot of other young talented players around him, the New Orleans Pelicans could be a very fun team to watch in the next handful of years.  I suggest watching some of the more we'll know teams (I know it all depends on what the actual season is with Covid), and decide which of the main contenders is most entertaining to watch for you. I know that's vague, so I'll reiterate that LeBron and the Lakers are my personal recommendation."
"Lebron James on the death of 6 year old Zhun-Wei Hang, who died late this afternoon after crying out 'my hands hurt, I cant make these shoes anymore, please give me a break'. ""Hey, someones gotta make the shoes."""
So we're just going through every series now? He averaged over double the points of any other player and lead in ever statistical category besides rebounds? The series where only one player on the Cavs not named LeBron James averaged over 10 PPG and it wasn't much over that?
"Seems to be,  with Pelicans landing Zion they have a core of young talent to build around &amp; compete with. Maybe not chip-worthy yet but I'm genuinely looking forward to the Ingram/Zion duo.  And AD teaming with LeBron is the best-case scenario for LA, especially with the timeframe they have left for LeBron. Not to mention King James clearly prefers playing with veterans, so win-win all around.  This is coming from an outside view, as a Bucks fan I don't have a pony in this race. FearTheDeer!"
"I think it's current players otherwise it's probably between MJ , Kobe or Yao Ming). I say Kobe or Ming because of the Chinese population and how popular these guys are in China .   But if it's current players it is hands down LeBron James."
"My thoughts on what the rosters might look like:  Atlanta: Bob Pettit,  Dominque Wilkins  Boston: Larry Bird, Bill Russell  Brooklyn: Jason Kidd, Vince Carter  Charlotte: Kemba Walker, Larry Johnson  Chicago: Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen  Cleveland: Lebron James, Mark Price  Dallas: Dirk Nowitzki, Rolando Blackman  Denver: Carmelo Anthony, Alex English  Detroit: Isiah Thomas, Bob Lanier  Golden St: Wilt Chamberlain, Steph Curry  Houston: Hakeem Olajuwon, James Harden  Indiana: Reggie Miller, Jermaine O'Neal  Clippers: Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo  Lakers: Kobe Bryant, Magic Johnson  Memphis: Pau Gasol, Mike Conley Jr  Miami: Dwyane Wade, Alonzo Mourning  Milwaukee: Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Giannis Antetokounmpo  Minnesota: Kevin Garnett, Karl Anthony Townes  New Orleans: Chris Paul, Anthony Davis  New York Knicks: Patrick Ewing, Walt Frazier  Oklahoma City: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook  Orlando: Shaquille O'Neal, Dwight Howard  Philadelphia: Julius Erving, Charles Barkley  Phoenix: Steve Nash, Amare Stoudemire  Portland: Dame Lillard, Clyde Drexler  Sacramento: Oscar Robertson, Peja Stojakovic  San Antonio: Tim Duncan, George Gervin  Seattle: Ray Allen, Gary Payton  Toronto: Chris Bosh, Kyle Lowry  Utah: John Stockton, Karl Malone  Washington: Elvin Hayes, John Wall"
"Not true, a lot of garbage gets upvotes on here too. See the Lebron James gave Kevin Love depression thread or the whole Woj is a Clippers shill debacle. It all depends on which way the circlejerk and memes are going."
Lebron   Lebron  Popovich  Mark Cuban (Good) James Dolan (Bad)  Masai   Stephen a Smith   Lakers
First two: LeBron  Coach: Popovich or Kerr I guess   FO member: Morey  Media: Stephen A Smith   Team: Lakers  Also owner is Mark Cuban or James Dolan
Lebron is double more once he drive into the paint than on the perimeter. Curry and Harden are very often picked up from baseline by one coverage and are usually doubled. Lebron I believe gets more single coverages than your average superstar because even though he is an all time great he is not great shooter and teams are willing to take the risk. In the raptors series he was making every jump shot/fade away he was just lighting them up but I believe that’s more of an exception than the rules.   James Harden Rockets were the closest team to dethroning Warriors with KD. James Harden averaged 29 and 35 points over the two series and fell to them in game 7 and 6.   All in all Lebron is in my top 3 plates of all time but I don’t believe he is the greatest 1v1 player due the skill disparity compared to his other peers.
"I wouldn't say very often at all.  he's guarded in single coverage as any other deadly scorer, when you can riks that way. In 2017 playoffs Harden was guarded a lot by Curry, imagine that.  Raptors tried that way in 2018 playoffs, Lebron was mostly guarded in single coverage by siakam and anunoby and it ended in a brutal disaster. Nobody could slow him down.  Warriors were able to slow down everybody except lebron who had like 33, 34ppg in 4 finals against them while guarded by elite defenders.   Look other scorers against the same warriors defense, how much they scored and how efficiently. None come close to James."
"Because he got schooled by JJ Barea. Never forget that LeBron ""China has done nothing wrong"" James put up 11 points in a finals game."
"This. Just in case people forgot:   https://youtu.be/lQcuh5OZ66k[Charles Barkey defends LeBron James,says criticism is “Really Unfair”](https://youtu.be/lQcuh5OZ66k)"
"You're missing the point. If Ben were a feared scorer he'd cause defenses to react stronger to his drives and post up attempts, making him a much more effective playmaker. Not about output, but quality of passes.  LeBron and Simmons average the same assists in a given season. Do you think Ben's passes are of the same quality of James? They aren't, because defenses understand that leaving LeBron open means allowing him to drop 30-40 and take over a game as a scorer AND playmaker. While with Simmons, it's just his passing that you're concerned about."
"*LeBron Raymone James* can't even post up J.J. Barea, what makes you think he can beat Kobe 1 on 1?"
"If you told people that a team with Lebron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh lost, they would think you are crazy. If you told people that a team with DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green didn't win the championship, they would think you are crazy. So, yes there is no such thing as a guaranteed ring."

"Well, a lot of people think LeBron is right there with Giannis.  Although I give the edge to Greek Freak (and not just cause homer), there is a very compelling case to be made for King James, especially putting up numbers like this in his age 35 season."

"I was confused like ""we ain't even have diplomatic relations with the CCP until Nixon"" then I realized you were talking about Lebron James not Lyndon B. Johnson."
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."

"No. I'm pointing out that continuously capitalize certain words and not other. It being on a phone is actually more damning for you because LeBron is not programmed into a phone as lebron and will autocorrect to LeBron. The name malcom doesn't even work on a phone as it tries to autocorrect to malcolm(if you choose not to capitalize it) or in my own case, it tries to capitalize it for me as the middle option saying Malcolm. So you're full of crap. Also it's clearly a throwaway. You named it throwaway a year ago. You didn't use it until two months ago. Then only on controversial topics. It's clearly a throwaway. There's no point in lying about that. Why even lie about that.  Read your first comment. Did you even mention Jersey City community? No. You said Black community and brought up LeBron James and Malcolm Jenkins. So you only meant Jersey City, then why did you bring them up? Also, for the record. Your statement was wrong about the Black community in Jersey City. The Hudson Black Caucus commented on it and didn't condone her message and said people from both sides should sit down and have a conversation so we can continue to live harmoniously together.  I gave historical examples of people being excluded from equality groups and the movement still working. You asked, could it work and I said it could. Provided historical basis. Don't misconstrue or misrepresent my argument. You're being intentionally obtuse.  White voters who vote in racist politicians do not get called out by their White 'leaders' and community. It's not selective blindness. Provide examples. Mitch McConnell routinely gets reelected and Kentuckians are not outraged.  &gt;Every election cycle people get upset at Iowans for electing Steve king but I guess you don’t care that. The only reason why Steve king lost this year is not because he is racist but because he lost all of his committee positions.  Interesting. So Iowans, the community didn't care about constantly reelecting a racist? Correct? Which your whole argument was about Jersey City Black people not caring about Joan Terrell(which was false). There's articles about Black Caucus and Black people calling her out. So the community didn't have outrage or weren't upset about constantly electing a racist? Ben Shapiro, another racist endorsed the Republican that Steve King ran against, Randy Feenstra, and Feenstra had the backing of the whole party.  You being in Jersey City doesn't make you a hero. You being there doesn't make your point any more clear. You're a biased person very clear. I'm calling you out, as an adamant prejudiced person. Is she wrong? Yes. Are you a prejudiced and biased person? Yes. Also, keep moving the goalposts. You keep trying to ignore all the points I'm making and talk around them and change your point. You completely ignored the LeBron James and DeSean Jackson points. This conversation is pointless because you're wrong about so many things and keep moving the goalposts hoping your points finally get in."
"You just said the Black community was silent as hell. Your words. If you meant organizations, say that. Very different points.  &gt;You can’t be like LeBron and Malcolm Jenkins and complain about “silence is being complicit“ and then not call out anti-Semitic members in your own sport.  Yeah. You can. People have been doing that in movements for the entirety of time but for some reason Black people are held to different standards. Let's get into it. Supposed LGBT leaders have been outed as racists and have had tons of racist followers that have not been called out. During the Women's Suffrage movement, women of color were largely left out. The history is there. Do we want our leaders to be perfect, yes. Is that actually possible? No. Should they condemn their own? Yes. Is it necessary for the movement? History has shown no. At least when it comes to racism against people of color.  I also find your lack of capitalization and spelling errors when it comes to LeBron James, Malcolm Jenkins and Black very suspect. Considering you've made sure to capitalize Jews, Hebrew, Israelite, but not Black nor LeBron, nor Malcolm(which you spelled incorrectly). Why?  &gt;The constituents of the black councilwoman should speak up, since the PERSON THEY VOTED IN is antisemitic. If you say ACAB because cops won’t turn in their own, then why wouldn’t that apply to sports, politicians, and religious ministers whose bullshit you preach on social media.  Where are the White constituents speaking up against all the racist White people in charge? They just keep electing them. You see how you have a massive double standard. You are exactly the same as Malcolm Jenkins and LeBron James. Where do you live? Who is your councilperson? Do you speak up every time they make a mistake? Do you protest them?  Also find it very interesting that you created a throwaway a year ago, and only really started ramping up your commenting after the George Floyd protests. Why? Were you at the recent Canadian protests for the Indigenous man Rodney Levi?"
"This is all just nonsense then.  This is an argument from 2001, “getting more rebounds” and “not being able to shoot” don’t make you a power forward. Also the odds that playing power forward will increase his rebounding doesn’t really make any sense either, unless he is going to be sitting on the low block clogging the paint.   And now adays most people consider defense a more accurate definition for position.  Lebron James, Luka doncic, and James Harden all functionally play point guard on offense but no one considers their classic standard position point guard."
I remember thinking that Darko Milicic would be a better draft pick than Lebron James.
I think LeBron James will breakout and lead the Lakers to the Finals.

"How would an NBA player who is following quarantine even know if another player has broken it? They are in their rooms all day or at practice.

""I heard Lebron had someone drop off something, I think it's that stuff he took a couple years back when he came to Miami.""  All of this over a joke about the snitch phone.

"I live in EST.  My normal Reddit operating hours are genuinely from 8AM to 1AM the next day (not the best thing i know, lol).  As you can see I’m on Reddit a lot, I’d say about a quarter of my time is spent on r/nba. Most of the other time I spend between r/orlandomagic, which I help mod, other sports subreddit teams, music, etc.  I’ve been a part of the r/nba community as long as my account has been around, which is 5 years. I had a previous Reddit account that had my full name as my username that I deleted. Including that I’ve been a part of r/nba the better part of a decade (8 years).  If there’s one thing I could change about r/nba it would be how representation is dissented among team fandoms. Suffice to say, some teams are vastly over presented on the subreddit as THE teams producing a bit of an elitist mentality amongst their fans. There is only so much one can do regarding this unfortunately, however, as I do not believe in stifling free speech, but I think some diversity amongst mods in regions and team fandoms would go along the way as the mods lead the sub by example, and by work. I think a Magic mod would bring that to the table. In addition, I believe a few subreddit rules from r/orlandomagic could be useful in r/nba on a wider scale. In addition, more pinned daily talks like Free Talk Friday, Moan Mondays, Whatever Wednesday, etc.’s could go along way in building a more familial setting in r/nba. Those are just examples of daily threads, they can be whatever else of course.  My favorite NBA memory is any of the buzzer-beater shots from the few years of Dwight, Rashard, Hedo, Jameer, JJ, Peitrus, Gortat, etc. Rashard Lewis’ buzzer beater for the win against the young LeBron James led Cavaliers is a big one, but I was really excited for Dwight’s .8 second left alley-pop from an inbound pass off the sideline to beat the Spurs.   I do have minimal experience with CSS.  I do have minimal experience with Python. I’m a data analyst for my job, and I’ve recently been picking up Python. I can’t lie and promise that I’m a great coder, but I do have experience in it, yes. I mainly work with data visualization i.e. PowerBI.  I do not have experience hosting Python script yet. That may happen in a month or so.  Sure, I can help mod the sub Discord. I mod my r/OrlandoMagic subreddit Discord already. I’m really fond of our Discord and its users, it’s the best Discord channel I’m a part of."
This reminds me a little of his [Lebron story](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/espn-yanks-unflattering-lebron-james-story-072810) from back in the day
"In hindsight, 2014-15 was pretty thick with good teams. There were 7 50-win teams in the West and 3 in the East, with the Raptors just barely missing the cut at 49 wins. Two teams won 60+ games and set franchise win records - the Hawks and the Warriors. The Hawks managed to sneak in a record 4 players plus their coach onto the All-Star team. The Grit and Grind Grizzlies had their best season to date, while the Rockets got the closest they've been to the Finals since Jordan left the league. Lob City was still at its peak.  Older players such as Kobe, Dirk, Tim Duncan, DWade, Pau Gasol, and Carmelo were all selected for the All-Star game. But the West was rotten with current and future MVPs, such as LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Steph Curry. Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Anthony Davis, Chris Bosh, and Blake Griffin also deserve a shout-out. The rest of the list contains stalwarts such as Dame, Klay, Lowry, LaMarcus Aldridge, Jimmy Butler, and Marc Gasol."
"Many of the people who are making the argument against the NBA and LeBron do not care at all about Chinese people. These people are simply doing this to detract from The credibility of these black people arguing for civil rights of black people in America.  Eg. I doubt clay Travis gives cares what happens in Hong Kong or to the uyghurs. He simply wants to make the argument that: ""see, they don't actually care about civil/human rights. They only care about their own rights. They aren't morally better than us. They are just as bigoted as we are. They don't give a s*** about the rights of people different from them, just like us.""  With that said I'm uncomfortable with how liberals  try to absolve multinational corporations like the NBA of any blame for doing business with a brutal dictatorship in China. American and European corporations are choosing money over civil/human rights. China is governed by a brutal dictatorship. they are capable of acts like the Tiananmen Square massacre. They have concentration camps for uyghur minorities. There is racism and discrimination against groups that are not ethnically Han Chinese. Eg. Uyghurs and Tibetans. Look at how the protesters in Hong Kong are being beaten by the police.  China is also nationalistic and has obvious aspirations to expand in the South China Sea. Eventually this will come to head in Taiwan at a minimum.  What the NBA is doing in China is morally wrong. I am disappointed so many liberal voices are choosing to absolve the NBA of legitimate criticism simply because the people who are making these legitimate criticisms are mostly bad faith actors. There are also actual Hong Kong protesters and advocates that are making the same criticisms of the NBA and LeBron James.  the thing that disappoints me most about LeBron James and the NBA is they gave bad faith actors like clay Travis such an easy win.  All the NBA had to do to be on the right side of history on this issue is be willing to earn slightly less money. Would NBA players and NBA owners be unable to feed their families if they didn't earn Chinese revenue?  imagine if instead of criticizing Morey for being uneducated for tweeting Hong Kong should be freed. LeBron had tweeted that he also believed that people in Hong Kong should have free and fair elections to choose their own leaders and that it was wrong the way the police were brutalizing the protesters.  LeBron and the NBA would have the moral high ground and the only thing they would be sacrificing is money.  Why is it wrong to criticize this level of greed? These people aren't robbing a convenience store so that they can put food in the mouths of their children. These are absurdly wealthy men that refuse to earn slightly less so they coddled the feelings of Chinese nationalists at the expense of the people who the Chinese government brutalizes.  what's wrong with criticizing this level of greed and immorality? what's wrong with criticizing this level of apathy for the human rights of uyghurs and people in Hong Kong?"

LeBron and the NBA would have the moral high ground and the only thing they would be sacrificing is money.  Why is it wrong to criticize this level of greed? These people aren't robbing a convenience store so that they can put food in the mouths of their children. These are absurdly wealthy men that refuse to earn slightly less so they coddled the feelings of Chinese nationalists at the expense of the people who the Chinese government brutalizes.  what's wrong with criticizing this level of greed and immorality? what's wrong with criticizing this level of apathy for the human rights of uyghurs and people in Hong Kong?"
He missed the playoffs with LeBron James
"i think that's a reach. i personally am not a fan of naming your child after yourself but it's so normalized now and i think this is not an egregious case.   now if his name was john and he named her john shumpert jr then yea i'd think that's pretty horrible. but i dont think iman shumpert jr will ever get bullied for being named iman, nobody's really gonna care lol iman is a nice name for a girl. it'd be bad if her dad was famous enough for it to get confusing but iman shumpert aint no lebron james."
"I respect the amount of work you put in, but the Twolves taking Shaq 2nd over the guy regarded as the 2nd best player ever in Lebron James is wack."
"We already know he's a good League of Legends player, I'm sure he plays all sorts of nerdy games.  [https://www.espn.com/espn/story/\_/page/instantawesome-141014/gordon-hayward-says-better-lebron-james-league-legends](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/page/instantawesome-141014/gordon-hayward-says-better-lebron-james-league-legends)"
My two cents:  1. LeBron James 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. James Harden 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Luka Doncic 6. Anthony Davis 7. Damian Lillard 8. Joel Embiid 9. Nikola Jokic 10. Paul George 11. Pascal Siakam 12. Russell Westbrook 13. Ben Simmons 14. Jayson Tatum 15. Jimmy Butler 16. Donovan Mitchell 17. Chris Paul 18. Kemba Walker 19. Rudy Gobert 20. Hassan Whiteside
"Too much unpredictability. Lebron james, giannis, and Kawhi could get corona and suddenly you have the celtics winning a championship"
"&gt; the lakers are depending on an entire rotation of guys with limited to no experience  Green: Multiple Championships  McGee: Multiple championships  KCP: 2016 playoffs  Morris: 2017 ECSF  Waiters: 2016 WCF  Dwight: 2009 Finals, former superstar  JR: Multiple Finals and championships  Rondo: Multiple playoff runs/championships  Basically only Kuzma and Caruso have no experience.  And that’s not even counting LeBron James and Anthony Davis  &gt;crossing their fingers Dwight matters more than he has in over 5 years.  Again with the bullshit. We were just on pace to win 65 games with Dwight off the bench buddy"
"LeBron James should've been brutally #canceled after his comments to Darryl Morey, however the media spins the narrative that is the most appropriate to the NBA agenda."
"1.  LeBron James has dragged more bums to the finals than any NBA alumni.    2.  Bill Russell will always be the goat, no matter how many rings MJ or LeBron got."
"Lebron James has Twitter, IG and a marketing team. He totally wants all the media attention he can get. It helps him sell shoes and market himself. Moving to LA had nothing to do media attention either? Lakers were total shit before he got there. Who are you kidding?"
sorry i edited my comment - i wasn't suggesting paul pierce doing the spying lol  &gt;if this were paul pierce or tony reali secretly record**ed** shit talking lebron james
LeBron James. LeBron James. LeBron James.
10. Russell Westbrook  9. Joel Embiid  8. Damian Lillard  7. Anthony Davis  6. Nikola Jokic  5. Luka Doncic  4. Kawhi Leonard  3. James Harden  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  1. LeBron James
if this were paul pierce secretly recorded shit talking lebron james in his hotel room the reactions would be completely different despite the action itself being exactly the same
Oh yeah and LeBron James is just a rebounder
I would love to see anyone pick up Lebron James and take him somewhere he doesn’t want to go without poisoning him or holding a gun to this head lol
"Zach Lowe is just a pure basketball fanatic, he’s gotta be #1 for me. Adrian Wojnarowski is up there, and I like Brian Windhorst because he’s a LeBron guy (if you are a LeBron James fan) and he has a finger on the league’s pulse to some extent. I don’t know if Kevin Arnovitz is ever on TV, but he writes for ESPN and I like his content; he’s on Zach Lowe’s podcast often as well and he’s sharp.  I don’t know how often Chris Haynes is on TV either, but he’s a legitimately good NBA journalist."
"LeBron by a slim margin. Giannis has reach, but James is gonna hit harder, maybe some ground and pound."
"The trouble is finding a mercenary or team of mercenaries big enough and strong to physically subdue 6'8"" 250 pounds of physically fit muscle that is LeBron James and cary him out of the bubble"
I’m referencing the fact that he got LeMao James instead of LeBron James.  How did that happen.  It’s a bad autocorrect.
"17 confirmed not wearing anything, last I saw. Then there was another 60 something that were undecided. Lemme try and find that source for you.  E: https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/lebron-james-to-not-wear-social-justice-message-on-nba-restart/1893441"
"LeBron ""don't talk about Hong Kong if people could be hurt financially"" James standing up for something that doesn't help his bottom dollar? I doubt it"
"I wasn’t proven wrong, people asking for athletes to speak up are inherently acting like they should.  You don’t just randomly say “man if blank spoke up on this” unless you think they should.   It wouldn’t help anything. Lebron James had an event for Hillary Clinton in Ohio after the Cavs won the title in 2016, and it didn’t mean shit.   Racists and bigots are going to be racists and bigots regardless of an athlete saying “this is bad”"
"The comment wasn't about comparing lebron and giannis' stats. It was about how the best player in the league doesnt win MVP over and over because at some point people get tired of voting for the same player. How many times did Jordan win MVP or even Shaq? Now compare that to the amount of years you thought they were the best player in the league when they played. I strongly believe the case for Lebron winning MVP this season would be stronger if his name wasn't lebron james (based on his stats and lakers being #1 seed in the west). If another player put up 25 ppg and lead the league in assists while having 50 wins at this point in the season? A fresh face probably would win with those accomplishments.  On a side note - comparing their stats doesnt paint the picture in terms of who is better between them. They are in different stages in their career. Not just age wise but they are on different missions. Lebron isn't about averaging 30 12 and 10 (he probably could while still also have the lakers only a few games out of being #1 overall). He's already had those monster stat type seasons. He's on a mission to win rings and that's it.  This isn't about stat chasing either as I don't believe Giannis does that. Giannis is still in the early prime of his career where putting up those stats defines who is he as a player. A younger player is going after it all. Playing every minute hard (fresh legs help that as well). Lebron knows at this stage its not about going hard literally every minute on the floor because he has to preserve what he has left. Not just for this playoff run but also if he wants to play at a high level again next year and the year after. If lebron was told he was only going to play 1 more year and to just ball out, I think he could also try to win DPOY while being at the top or nearly the top of a bunch of statistically categories but he's in year 17 and he has to take that into account.  Not saying the race isn't close. I just believe Lebron is still #1"
"Jesus y'all couldn't miss the point more than this.   James is saying that he doesn't want any animosity to form between him and his teammates because OBVIOUSLY LeBron is living in what is likely better conditions than anyone else there, and some might take offense to that. Even just a little distrust between them can go a long way on the court, I'd imagine.   While ""rigors"" is strange word choice, it still fits. The other players are going to be experiencing more hardships *relative to LeBron*, so that is what he is talking about.   This all but confirms that LeBron is living better than his teammates and that his teammates are aware of it.  Edit: Just as an example that we can better relate to, think of it like this: You and five of your buddies are all staying somewhere at some hotel. You all got seperate rooms. Your room has the only working refigerator. Your friends are going through rigors that you are not."
"I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt but it's crazy to me these are your genuine conclusions.  &gt; Usually the people who says this say it about those with a platform. Who would they want that Nebraska farmer to speak to about BLM? Himself? His wife?   His community? His kids? His church? Etc  Just because someone doesn't live in a big city doesn't mean they have no network lol.  As far as the whole silence is violence mindset, it is definitely a prevailing thought.   https://www.npr.org/2020/06/09/873375416/there-is-no-neutral-nice-white-people-can-still-be-complicit-in-a-racist-society  &gt;No matter how much LeBron or anybody else spoke out in support of HK, there still would be literally nothing we can do about it. Whereas that Nebraska farmer's vote makes a direct impact on the lives of those around him. I'm not sure what the actual change is that you want LeBron to effect.  Your lack of comprehension regarding the power of one vote vs millions/billions of dollars is fascinating.   As you said, voting power is mostly tied to local elections. If someone lives in an area that is basically all white, their vote doesn't have much direct power to increase racism. At least not nearly as much as the power of being a proponent of businesses in places like China. The more money China has, the more influence they have on HK, their own people, and the rest of the world.   Literally nothing he can do about it? That's not true and you know it, or at least you should.   Some background info for you:  https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2019/10/17/lebron-james-nike-china-revenue/3989915002/   Also consider the players that have shoe deals directly with Chinese companies."
LeBron James led the Cavs to a title alongside Kyrie and Kevin Love. They weren’t exactly hopeless
"Yeah they did the ol LeBron James defense strategy. They let Giannis get his and tried to shut down the other defenders. They did that successfully. The issue is that, like you said, they couldn’t buy a bucket"
"LeBron ""he shouldn't speak without knowing who he is affecting emotionally, financially, spiritually"" James"
"The only modicum of respect I give refs is that I don’t often see them cave to the power imbalance. They are literally the low man on totem pole on the court at all times. Like.. imagine T’ing up LeBron James. Someone that could very well ruin their life if they wanted to. I don’t care who you are, that has got to be intimidating."
"I could also ask my 51 year old mom who lebron James is.. and she would not have a clue. And I just never could get into hockey.  I grew up really poor in rural oklahoma so it was basketball, baseball, or football.. couldn't afford more than one pair of shoes every couple years so I had to pick one sport. Basketball was always my favorite. As a 11 year old I watched the entire 2004 bronze Olympic basketball games. Haha I was a spurs fan so it wasn't all that bad I guess, at least Manu had a good run"
"I don't care which star you pick from the West and put him in the East, 8 consecutive Finals trip is a hell of an accomplishment. NBA teams are not a joke, injuries can happen, teams can get cold and hot, teams can change in a season. 8 STRAIGHT TRIPS TO THE FINAL IS NOT A JOKE.   Reminder that Lebron James and the Lakers are first seed in the West."
"I don’t like baseball either, but you don’t like hockey? Best playoffs of any sport. So exciting. The comment also said most people. Maybe that’s an exaggeration but I think it’s fair to say that if you ask, say, a 14 year old girl who hates sports who LeBron James is she would know. If you ask her who Crosby is? That’s more up in the air."
"He would be between Ben Simmons and Lebron James, which would be a damn good player in today’s game."
Where is lebron james? Shouldnt he be criticizing this and ask for apology like he to drew brees?
Yeah he’s better than Lebron James. Whatever you say
Black folks politically only care about other black folks.. look at lebron james and china
1. LeBron James 2. Larry Bird  3. Kevin Durant  4. Julius Erving  5. Scottie Pippen 6. Kawhi Leonard  7. Paul Pierce  8. Carmelo Anthony  9. James Worthy 10. Grant Hill
You spelled LeBron James and Anthony Davis wrong
"Dude, PG13 was literally an MVP candidate last year just a distant 3rd from Giannis and Harden  he has competed Neck and neck with LEBRON JAMES before.  do you seriously not think he doesn't think he's the best?   there's a tier of guys, and if you're in that tier you feel you're just as good as anyone else sans like Lebron given he's potentially the GOAT.  Kawhi hasn't really proven himself to be on that level."
"Shaq and LeBron are pretty much our only big free agent signings in franchise history, besides that we drafted Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Magic Johnson, and James Worthy, traded for Wilt, Kareem, Kobe, Pau, AD. I will give you LeBron pretty much bailed us out in free agency and helped us land AD for our current team, but pretty much every other championship team we have made great draft picks and trades. Regardless, I understand that a lot of fans hate the Lakers from teams like the Celtics, Spurs, Suns, Blazers, Kings, etc, because we have a history of playoff series and big games against them but with Toronto you can't say that."
"People only hate the Lakers because of the name and Lebron James. We really don’t have that many unlikeable players (I can see Howard being unlikeable), but most of our “haters” are just Bron haters and bc of our name, not the personnel. Clippers on the other hand are full of genuinely unlikeable players that have an ego of a 3 peat, with nothing to show for it. The only one on the team that can act like they do is Kawhi, yet he is the only calm and collective one"
So we just ignoring how LeBron tried using a headband earlier this season and [it ended up peeling back his hairline like it was held in place with Elmer's glue?](https://3rwg8o2ujdv92huqkh3ihn24-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lebron-james-hair.jpg)
LeBron James: 10 pts
Okay so Lebron James only played 55 games in the 2018-19 season. Would you characterize this as laziness?
"not really because they will miss games, but i can see them going 16-0 in the playoffs because you have the best iso scorer in the NBA and Lebron James the best playmaker. Even just Kawhi and LBJ are too much, now imagine if you add AD"
PG for Lebron james
*Cavaliers Lebron James has entered the chat*
Man there is no way Lebron James was not the best player in 2018. He was going absolutely insane all playoffs and Kawhi wasn't even playing.
"Maybe. But it’s clear he’s having some issues scoring and doesn’t get up the way he used to be able to do it. People talk about Lebron doesn’t look to score, but he’s not going 9-20 because he wants to. In some of these games he’s getting up shots, he’s just not able to draw the foul or make the basket. This stuff would make more sense if James was putting up an efficient 20 points on low volume. But he is really having some inefficient games."
She's annoying. Literally all she does is make sure Jimmy Butler and Lebron James look good.
"LeBronto literally cannot beat LeBron James in the playoffs, sorry. He owns you."
Michael Jordan were better than the Lebron James are.
"I don't think you totally understand.      PG can fit onto any team, as his skills as a defender and shooter are valued. Kinda like an All-Star version of Robert Covington. Paul George is a complement to a team.     Doncic is the team, as his skills as a ball handler and shot creator are valued. Kinda like a less-athletic Lebron James. Luka Doncic is the team's leader. You need complementary players to fit around a leader. Doncic is that leader, George is that complement."
Anyone know how many Doncic needs to have most in first 3 playoff games?  edit: nvm found it - current top five for first 3 games:   Wilt Chamberlain - 116  George Mikan - 107  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - 102  LeBron James - 99  Kelly Tripucka - 93
Mookie Betts is genuinely more fun to watch than LeBron James.
"Sure but none of those other teams we played had an Anthony David and lebron James problem. Not saying Zach would stop those two or is the difference between us for sure winning or not, but his absence makes winning this series quite a bit more difficult."
LeBRON JAMES!!
"Our team is just cursed this year man.  We played a grand total of **zero** games with our starting 5, only 8 games with 4 starters, and just 13 games with 3 starters  That's just wild man. What kinda trash luck do you have to be where you only get 2/5 starters for 65/76 games...and only 1 starter in 12 of those 65?  Or in other words, we're guarding Lebron James and Anthony Davis in the playoffs with the corpse of Melo and a rookie G-leaguer named Wenyen Gabriel.  Edit: Oh, and CJ's back is broken. Can't forget that. Lmaooooo great year :("
LeBron James are better than Michael Jordan were
That's just because lebron james is a spot up shooter who gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch.
"Steph curry, LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Damian Lillard, Kyle Kuzma, Alex Caruso"
Duncan Robinson  Stephen Curry  Stephen Curry  Rudy Gobert  Rudy Gobert  Kawhi Leonard  Marcus Smart  Kyrie Irving  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Chris Paul  Steven Adams  De'Aaron Fox
"One of the best in terms of hands and footwork.  Other Laker greats that worked out with Olajuwon:  Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, Dwight Howard, &amp; Javale Mcgee."
Fuck Lebron James. He is a racist piece of shit that only works for his own self-interest.
"He’s averaging 30 a game on great efficiency, I don’t know what else he can do.  Lebron James in the 2016 finals scoring numbers.  You can’t post up every single play.  At some point his teammates have to step up"
Trying to see the associations.  LeBron = King = Lion King  Kawhi = Claw = Toy Story  James Harden = Rockets play small ball = Seven Dwarfs  DeMar DeRozan = outspoken about mental health = Inside Out  Giannis = Greek = Hercules
Didn’t Lebron quit on his team in 2010 against Celtics in the playoffs and the 2018 finals   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportingnews.com/us/amp/nba/news/lebron-james-2011-finals-stats-miami-heat-dallas-mavericks-nba-news-eddie-house/8isbyhljod3w1prqp4g1gknwi also apparently this
"There are a lot of elements at play here.  1. LeBron is one of the first superathletes to dedicate time and enormous amounts of money to his body. The other guys you mentioned took care of themselves, but they weren't getting in cryo tubs at home every night. Bronny has access to that. If he wants to make the league, his physical attributes will be maximized to their greatest extent.  2. Much like his dad, Bronny has an eye for passing. He's 6'2 right now, so we can guess he'll be 6'3 or 6'4 by the time he's done growing. Pre-2020 that was a ""6'5"" player in the NBA. That's tall for a point guard. Combine it with elite athleticism and he'd be a solid player anywhere, even if he wouldn't be an NBA player without his dad.  3. He's LeBron's son. There is definitely some implicit collusion there, but people want to be liked by successful people. He'll draw a crowd and fill some seats.  4. He's LeBron's son, in a different way. We've all already heard the narrative that the Jamesgang wants to play together. This makes Bronny valuable. If you draft Bronny, you're either going to get to sign LeBron, or he's going to force his team to trade some assets to overpay for him.  5. He really is a good player with a solid head on his shoulders. Major props to the whole James family, they seem to have raised really well-balanced kids. He doesn't seem to feel a ton of pressure to be great, but he still works hard and shows potential."
"Surely by your own metrics Giannis is miles ahead of AD. He leads the best team in the NBA in pts, assists and rebounds and has DPOY level defence. And he doesnt have lebron james on his team. AD hasnt had as much post season success as Giannis has either."
Warriors get: LeBron James  Lakers get: #2 pick. Draymond and Wiggins  Lakers draft: LaMelo  C: Davis  PF: Draymond  SF: Kuzma  SG: Wiggins  PG: LaMelo  This is the most kino trade.

Gonna name my kid Lebron James Jr. as his first name and see what he amounts to

People seem to forget LeBron is 35 and technically out of his prime while everyone else you mentioned aside from Luka is in their prime/peak of athleticism. There’s a retrospective air of respect in the league that a 30 yo LeBron would be better than his counterparts and most recognize it.. how do you leave KD out of the discussion too? As of this year? It’s a tie between James Harden and Giannis as runner up to LeBron.
PG: Ben Simmons  SG: Bruce Brown Jr. ( mediocre player but wow he’s strong)  SF: LeBron James  PF: Blake Griffin  C: Joel Embiid (strongest in the league)
"I don’t understand this argument. Players with less help have better volume on worse efficiency... exactly what James did, except he was worse in volume and WAY worse in efficiency.   I suppose you can compare team success eventually, but even if Luka loses in the first round it’s no different than LeBron. LeBron joined a super team due to the lack of his playoff success. I can’t believe how his 2016 victory washed that away."
36 yeat old Lebron had 10 points and 6 turnovers tonight while he watched Anthony Davis carry him. And also why in the world you comparing wins and losses this year when the Nets played without Kyrie and Kd? Why don't we take off Lebron James and Anthony Davis from the Lakers and see how many wins the Lakers get?
"""Lakers are better and will always be better"" sure with a 36 year old lebron James, Anthony Davis who's a free agent this year and a front office that has zero idea how to develop talent they will surely ""always be better"" 😂. Incredible how delusional laker fans are. And the meme team will totally get past a red hot rockets team that beat them in the regular season, and the Clippers who nearly beat them without Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell. Whatever makes you sleep at night bud 💀."
":D Because he's LeBron James and we know what he can do in the Playoffs?  Very few others get such excuses, because very few others are anywhere near his level. I wouldn't say he was coasting though, just didn't have it going offensively to start and instead of getting himself going he kept passing, because the Blazers had Nurkic and Whiteside in to double him.  Just off offensively to start and smart enough to go to what works instead of forcing shots to get himself going."
I think Lebron / Pippen is a waaayyyyy better comparison. Pippen being a B tier James
"I mean, if I could already say “I’m a professional NBA player who took on the likes of LeBron James in the playoffs” probably not."
LeBron James is shooting a career 73% from the free throw line and is 3rd on the ALL TIME NBA SCORING list......
"With the third pick, you can drop down to 7 while the first pick can only drop down to 5.  Not precise, but good enough analogy: You and Lebron James each buy $1 million dollar in lottery tickets. You and Lebron have the same odds to win the lottery, but you have much more to lose if you lose the lottery than Lebron. You move up by winning."
"I mean...his name is Lebron James Jr., not quite something many kids can say"
"I'm mad at all the plague episodes we could have gotten.  Can you imagine a medieval bubble???  Adam Silver erecting a leather and cloth bubble dome over an entire castle and all the players having to share castle quarters with each other.  Jimmy Butler running into his old teammates in the hallway, Westbrook woken up in the of the night by the Mediadel ravens next to his room.  Lebron having to make small talk at the lavatory with the former Lakers he traded.  James Harden sneaking wenches in from the secret tunnel and finding Chris Paul down there planning another attack."
If you could tell everyone and anyone who’d listen “LeBron fucking James gave me my first nose bleed ever” you wouldn’t be stoked?
“Ol goat james is back skeeeup”   “There is NO WAY Lebron could ever match the GREATNESS of Michael Jeffery Jordan”   “don’t do dat skeeeup”
"""I pretty much have a broken hand"" - LeBron James  - Damian Lillard"
"Did you watch the game? The game devolved into shooting practice, probably just to get some of the lower bench players in rhythm. Lebron exited the game early 10-7-6 because the Blazers got destroyed, of course he wasn’t taking shots. You know a **playoff** game is a blowout if Lebron James is playing and he only scored 10 points."
A good chance to be a higher offensive impact than LeBron James?  No. Possible but no
"LeBron ""Mason Plumlee"" James with the killer 10/6/7 line"
"Lebron missed a layup right before this, then makes a 3 point bank shot while falling away. Why? Because he's Lebron motherfucking James."
Lebron james scored 10 points and his team won a playoff game  That must be a record
"I was led to believe LeBron James was going to hang up his shoes and AD would leave, throwing us back into irrelevancy."
is that quote really that bad though? if anything it is recognizing the hardship that they went through.   Lebron James openly talks about how it was tough growing up with just his mom all the time.
"Okay you don’t make sense but I will go back to my original point, have you heard of LeBron James and Anthony Davis?"
I need a LeBron James can for every time JR Smith makes/miss a shot. It'd be meme worthy.
"&gt; ""First game I play, y'all coast. Second game y'all play, I coast.""  LeBron James' master plan (probably)"
Lebron james for 1st round pick + andrew wiggins
JR SMITH OUTSCORED WASHED KING LEBRON JAMES

Lebron James played less than 30 minutes and scored 10 points. We played Jared Dudley. We won by 25. If Avery Bradley was here we destroy everyone.

are you all just joking and i cant realize? you all sound very confident in giving lebron james advice on how to shoot a basketball
This game fucking sucks. The only good part is watching LeBron James get held off by a 21 year old sophomore
Rumor has it the court is also set to 50 degrees to keep LeBron James' whine at the right temperature.
Imagine waking up from a coma and seeing GTJ able to D up LeBron fuckin James
You cannot tell me Gary Trent Jr is able to D up Lebron James man
Lebron James keeps passing to wide open shooters who are just tossing up brick after brick.
*lebron James*    Wherever he go when he not on the court his teams be ass lmao
lebron james is basically just a roided up JKidd at this stage of his career  dude has no jumper and refuses to be aggressive  granted that's still an elite player
LEBRON JAMES
LeBron James has lost more Western Conference playoff games than Micheal Jordan ever did

Lebron James will have earned over a billions dollars by the end of his career.  So you are saying Lebron James is a bad person who exploited people.    Besides Jason Terry who has Lebron exploited?
&gt; LeBeijing James is on that same wealth train. That money will stick for more generations than their kids.  That is a gross mischaracterization of Lebron. Lebron (or most Americans for that matter) obviously don't condone Uyghur genocide.    But nothing has stopped for us. Life goes on. We love China and paying to China.   So why must players suffer the financial burden for when an exec mouths off? It's not like by speaking out Morey changed anything?    Instead lebron devotes a lot of his time and money to causes he can actually affect - and he's a real champion for that.
This is fine but what about Lebron James not getting free throws on his drives?
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Vogel told them this when they were up at half in game 1. Nothing will change if they're up 3-1. This isnt the Pat Bev Clippers, it's LeBron James - you have to trust the experience and intelligence of this man. Nothing is a given and he knows that"
None of those teams have Lebron James or AD..do you not watch undisputed or First Take? No one thinks the Heat have a chance against the Lakers..I hope they fucking get swept 🖕🏿
"I’ll tell you why LeBron has only won one title since he left the Heat. (No disrespect to the Warriors, not trying to take away or put asterisks by their titles)  2015: Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving were hurt. LeBron was all alone with Delly as his second best player. It’s reasonable to expect him to win that series.  2017 &amp; 2018: I don’t think it’s remotely reasonable to expect LeBron to be able to beat one of the best teams of all time after they pick up the second best player in the world.  2019: He was playing with a bunch of boys and coasted after he got hurt. He was saving himself for next year.  You really think LeBron James on the Heat could’ve beat the Warriors? Maybe in 2015, but definitely not 2017 &amp; 2018. LeBron would have just as many with *maybe* one more if he stayed. (Jimmy Butler has had an injury history too so we can’t assume he’d be perfectly healthy in 2015 either)  On top of all that, 3 more titles in Miami wouldn’t have meant nearly as much as the championship in 2016 in his hometown. He never would’ve fulfilled his promise to Cleveland and it would’ve been a scar on his legacy."
Because they're against Lebron James.
Because they're the fucking Nuggets and facing a team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Being called the Nuggets should automatically lower their odds against any opponents.
"I mean, taking 3/7 against Lebron James, Kyrie, and KLove, 3 of the best players of their positions isnt bad. Also, losing to the Raptors when you dont have KD isnt that bad either"
"Oh yeah, like how PG and Kawhi did with their forearms on drives? Look at how many FTs they got with Mavs and Nuggets. There is a clear bias for whatever, against LeBron James. Come on, dude. You literally used one example out of a series with 3 games to say he tackles people like it's the NFL. Talk about cherry picking."
"Not to mention this, you dont disrespect Pat Riley, especially after he gave you the best chance of winning out of any team youve ever been apart of. https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2834895-stephen-a-lebron-james-played-video-game-during-pat-rileys-fa-pitch-in-2014"
"Dawg, you linked one game and used that to justify that Lebron James didn't warrant FT's. You can't claim that and not post the other games. The burden of proof is on you not me....yikes. ""I linked every drive Lebron made for game 3, why don't you show me proof from game 2 and game 1"". lmfao...   I'm sure the Lakers filed a formal complaint without any proof. Makes sense."
"Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kareem, Bill Russell, Magic, Bird, and Wilt are definitely ahead of him. He’s in the 8-10 range.   I’d also put Duncan and Oscar Robertson ahead of him too personally and probably Kobe although that ones more of a toss up.  Curry will definitely pass him too and probably Durant.   He’s 11 on my list. Possibly 10 and that’s where he is on most people’s lists. I rarely see a list with him in the top 10.   Harden is not that far off from the top 15. If he wins a single ring he will go there. He’s already a top 3 scorer all time."
Same story happened in Cleveland for years. Quit being so butt hurt LA.  2015: https://www.espn.com/blog/cleveland-cavaliers/post/_/id/1696/is-there-reason-to-cry-foul-at-lebron-james-lack-of-free-throw-attempts
Skip Bayless once said a 50 Year old Michael Jordan could beat Lebron James in 2015
"""Inefficient chucker""...right. Did you even watch the series or are you just misinterpreting numbers?   Lebron was the only offensive weapon on the team. When that happens he does not have the luxury of only taking efficient shots. If you are at a scoring disadvantage, more possessions will exacerbate your disadvantage. In that setting the strategy is mostly one of attrition. Slow the game down, try to grind out points if you can, keep it close and maybe with the random variance and runs that happen you get lucky and squeak out enough to win a game.   Is it beautiful basketball? No. Should he have won a FMVP for it? There's not really a precedent for that in the modern NBA so it's unlikely. Is it ""poor play""?  Learn how to watch basketball rather than being strictly outcome oriented. Zach Lowe had a great article for it on Grantland: https://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-good-and-bad-of-the-lebron-juggernaut/  I'm not sure what you're arguing with me. I have not indicated that Andre winning was a travesty. I have stated unequivocally that there were people who argued that each of them should have won, probably moreso for Lebron than for Curry. Andre winning was a result of great defense, but largely narrative. Curry was expected to play very well, when he does so it is unremarkable. Iggy was not supposed to be a changemaker in the series and some felt like he ""saved"" the warriors--which should tell you how much of an impact Lebron had as essentially a 1-man army that series.   Also, comparing Iggy's performance to Magic Johnson, Kareem, Worthy, Billups, Parker, that is laughable. It's more akin to Kawhi's performance for the spurs the previous year. Which, ironically, he also won for essentially being the best Lebron defender despite being essentially a promising roleplayer for his team.   None of this changes that James lost, losers don't win FMVP, and no one stood out enough for the Warriors for there to be a runaway selection. Injuries suck, sometimes you get unlucky, as the Warriors learned in 2019."
"Well he was better in the playoffs when he had LeBron James, Chris bosh and end of prime shaq on his team. He barely made the playoffs in the eastern conference without them. Harden did all that without any all stars and in the west. How are u defending him when he went 10-41? Imagine if James Harden went 10-41 in a season. U would never see the end of James harden slander if that happened."
"&gt;an Adam Sandler film produced by LeBron James  I think we all know that's going to be a complete mess, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious"
"&gt;You guys are prob the worst shooting team left at this point, so would a zone be effective against yall?  Yeah, true, the Lakers definitely aren't the best shooting team and can be pretty streaky shooting from the 3 point line, but I'm going to copy and paste a part of a comment that I made on r/nba about 6 days ago, but here's this interesting stat:  [According to Tim_NBA on Twitter, ""The Lakers have faced zone defenses 9th most frequently among NBA teams this year, and have been the 2nd most efficient among those 9 teams (8th ranked efficiency overall).""] (https://twitter.com/Tim_NBA/status/1306778650856042501?s=19)  So it seems that the Lakers have the ability to score against a zone defense rather efficiently apparently. If you have LeBron James or Anthony Davis in the middle of the zone defense, then that could break down the Miami Heat's defense since zone defenses become susceptible once somebody is in the middle of it, or somebody drives and kicks the ball out for a wide open shot when the defense gets sucked in. This has happened multiple times before in the regular season in the Lakers/Heat 2 matchups even though the Miami Heat are a different team now lol  Here's another fun stat about the Lakers: The Lakers are 10-0 in the NBA Playoffs when shooting at least 30% from the 3 point line, which is kind of crazy to me lol"
&gt; Juan Hernangomez isn't able to make it because he's filming an Adam Sandler film produced by LeBron James.  That's a funny way to hide tampering...
"Iguodala: on court +14.4, off court -13.1, on-off +27.5  Curry: on court +10.4, off court -11.8, on-off +22.2  LeBron: on court -4.7, off court -40.9, on-off +36.2  Yes; he carried that Cav’s team because Kyrie only played 44 total minutes in the first game and his bench was poor without him. Doesn’t really change the fact he was an inefficient chucker that series with heavy volume because of it. A difference of 9 +/- isn’t enough to win it as a 2-4 losing team; especially when you don’t even lead in other metrics like BPM/Win Shares.   Not to mention that Lebron’s statline was so poor *because of Iggy*. It would be one thing if this was Steph winning it compared to Lebron, but Iggy was the reason Lebron wasn’t shooting well.  It wasn’t even wildly off from the norm for Iggy to win it over Steph;  * JoJo White (over Havlicek or Cowens) 1976 * Magic Johnson (over Kareem) 1980 and 1982 * Cedric Maxwell (over Bird) 1981 * Kareem (over Magic) 1985 * James Worthy (over Magic) 1987 * Joe Dumars (over Isiah) 1989 * Chauncey Billups (over Ben Wallace) 2004 * Tony Parker (over Duncan) 2007 * Paul Pierce (over Garnett) 2008"
"Straight up looking like a bot generated headline.  Edit - Here's the context!  &gt; Among the two dozen or so players who will miss mini-camp with their teams, the most unusual reason comes from Juan Hernangomez. He has committed to filming a movie, which he did not know would interfere with the workouts. This project is with Adam Sandler, who starred alongside former Minnesota Timberwolves superstar Kevin Garnett in Uncut Gems last year. **The movie is about a basketball scout seeking talent overseas and is produced by LeBron James.**"
"    James Harden, Jimmy Butler, LeBron James, Davis Bertans  Three superstars and some dude on the Rockets.  Anyway, now that I think about it, you're right. MJ with a beard would definitely be worse."
I'm sure he was advised against it since he was basically crowned by the media as the next LeBron James. I wonder if Kobe wore Jordans before he had his own shoe.
"Breonna Taylor has a dead body in her trunk in 2016.  Breonna Taylor was a key player in a drug ring. Breonna Taylor was a shit human being.  Fuck LeBron James, the man is intellectually weak, good thing his only job is to play a game."
"Lol James Harden was 4th in the league in fouls committed this year, 1.5 more per game than LeBron"
&gt; the biggest badass in the NBA.  Lol what? Lebron James?
Such a trash comment. You explain everything so eloquently. But lebron James still told Daryl to shut up BECAUSE HW WANTED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE MONEY IN CHINA.  Lebron chose to prioritize MONEY over taking a stand and using his MASSIVE platform to shed light on some of the MANY injustices going on in China.   Here in America we’re so privileged that we like to pretend criminals being arrested in Portland by plain clothes officers is a worse event than the millions of Muslims being sent to concentration/ work camps.  If you can still sit here and say that lebron is a victim u need to find god or something. can’t fix fking stupid
"Yes, the NBA powerhouse Denver Nuggets were guiding the referees' hands against that scrub LeBron James. Poor little Lakers."
Or they’re just accurately pointing out the hypocrisy?? Lebron James said “black people are being hunted when they walk out their door” exaggeration? And at the same time crucified Daryl for saying “peace with Hong Kong” hmmmmm. Am I distracting from BLM or???
"[LeBron James Game 3 vs Nuggets Full Play video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzHZN4zZiB8)  Find me the non-called fouls, I'm begging you."
I wouldn't say team of stars.  In a Miami/Lakers series if you talk about ranking the best players it goes;  1. LeBron James 2. Anthony Davis 3. The entire Miami Heat Roster 4. The rest of the Lakers roster.
"You'r underestimating skills. Lebron James would get his knees kicked in and taken to the floor, dragged out to deep waters and drowned. It's a different kind of sport with a different breed of human beings."
"Basketball is a game of momentum. Lakers went on two insanely hot runs, but Murray/Jokic managed to keep Denver ontop despite going up against LeBron fucking James and AD."
Or the story about LeBron James getting more motivated against players who wear Lebron's signature shoes
"Which is what I can't get past. You (NBA) lose all moral high ground when you suppress you employees speech on one thing and then flout another. It's not Jalen's fault, he can say what he wants. He's not obligated to care about one thing because he cares about another.* But organizationally the NBA can get fucked.   *Except Lebron. He made his bed when he criticized Morey for being uneducated on the issue and mouthpieced for China. Lebron James can get fucked all the way on any morality plays."
“Top 5 player” = needs LeBron to get anywhere  “Not a top 5 player” = takes a team of role players and one decent scoring guard to the conference finals and makes it tough on the supposed top 5 player that has LeBron James  Keep watching with a blindfold on kiddo
"If Rudy Gobert, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Lebron James, and Anthony Davis have all failed to prevent consistently huge games from Jokic, how do you think the Heat will do as well or better than them?"
There's a dude named LeBron james that's pretty good
"Oh, idk, Jimmy Butler/Tyler Herro &gt; Lebron James/AD?  Honestly, bro, do you even watch basketball?"
"**Players entering the floor for the tip-off**  ""Looks like the players are getting ready to start the game. We'll give it to our sideline reporter David Aldridge""  DA: ""Thanks Kevin. The Hea-""  ""Thanks D.A. We'll be back after this Allstate commercial and the ""Where's LeBron James Now?"" segment. """
"Oh dang, you too? Well for me it was kinda the same. This one time in the spring of 2019 (Lebron was resting already), I was jogging with my poodle and as I start crossing this one street out in Brentwood, lo and fucking behold, there is Lebron dancing on a street sign like it's a stripper pole. It was late at night and pretty dark out, so he probably didn't expect to be spotted. Anyways, I sprinted up to him because I love the NBA and relish any chance to talk to a player. He was playing Sisqo on his phone and I just burst out laughing when the ""dumps like a truck"" came on cause Lebron was all inverted and everything. After watching him for about a good 5 minutes (the man is ATHLETIC), he finally notices me (Mr. James was in a trance I guess). He starts acting all embarrassed and covering himself with a towel he had on the ground. He starts begging me, ""Please, please, please don't take any pictures, please, please, please don't tell anybody about this!"" So I ask him, ""what's in it for me?""  You know a guy who won 100K off of Lebron. I have a pair of his crotchless panties."
"Lebron is definitely smart enough to definitely NOT do that. If you’re changing how you play because of refs, you’re not Lebron James"
"ECF Game 7, Cleveland Cavaliers at Boston Celtics, May 27, 2018  LeBron James, 48 minutes, 35/15/9 on 50/38/73 splits.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201805270BOS.html"
and LeBron James settled for jumpers because he was tired of jogging through the open lane to the basket untouched? You're just looking at the game with bias so you wont see it. It's like how I'm a Laker fan so I see Jokic tugging on people limbs and grabbing and shoving them but everybody that hates the Lakers thinks he's squeaky clean. If you think LeBron has only been fouled 4 times total through three games I don't know what I can tell you
"“Fouls per drive rate among superstar players who drive a lot. LeBron - .138 Luka - .141 Dame - .173 Harden - .205 Kawhi - .186 Giannis - .249”   He literally gets less calls per drive. Do you honestly think players just out of nowhere play perfect defense when it comes to guarding LeBron James every time he drives and they just never foul him? LeBron goes into people, and when other players do it it’s “a smart move to create contact and draw the foul” and even Giannis elbowing people gets him to the line. When LeBron does it they go “oh he’s strong so we’ll let the defender foul him a little” it’s just like Shaq. I don’t know you at all but it sounds like you could have a bias on this topic"
No thats a testament to how good lebron james is.  He is so much better than almost everyone in the NBA that pairing him with all stars and superstars is basically a guaranteed finals appearance.  Even putting him on the worst team in the NBA is a guaranteed playoff berth
"Ah yes, the hero for justice and freedom: Lebron James"
"You can watch them all here, just hit FGA in the box score and they should play through.

Only ones that he may have been fouled going up:  * third lay up in 1Q but he doesn’t complain to the refs and it was a dead ball, if he got fouled he definitely would have complained. * 3Q 6:52 the drive after he made the two fade always. He yelled really loudly and made the basket. * Porter steal on his 4th TO. He reached across James but it looked like all ball   There were also a couple bumps early on drives before Lebron gets free and moves to the basket but they weren’t calling those either way last night as far as I remember."
"im in awe of how embarrassingly ignorant people are over this issue. The cops didnt choose to enter the house; they were ordered to by people higher up. They did not commit murder. They were shot at and responded with fire. The people to blame for this are higher up in the police department. Once the cops are being shot at, what do you really expect them to do? Not to mention the beyond ignorant tweets from lebron james. Someone is clearly in his ear spewing garbage."
"No we shouldnt, this has been a thing all season.   There have even been articles about it: https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/1/24/21080019/lebron-james-los-angeles-lakers-free-throws  Also here's a fun fact:   &gt;""LeBron drove 945 times (12th) in the regular season. Giannis drove 654 (39th).  &gt;Giannis shot 629 (2nd) free throws. LeBron shot 381 (16th)  &gt;So, Giannis shot 0.96 free throws per drive. LeBron shot 0.4 per drive.  &gt;https://stats.nba.com/players/drives/?sort=DRIVES&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals""  He's taken 10 free throws for the whole series and 2 of those came from the Murray flagrant. So that's 4 calls for 3 games? If the Nuggets were just ""letting him go straight to the basket unimpeded"" like they are saying it would have been 3 blowouts too."

Even if you disregard all of this thanks for asking for more info instead of just downvoting me. I don't get more people cant just have a discussion instead of downvoting things
"That's a great question. He definitely CAN be the best player on a championship team, but I don't think he can sell out an arena and he deliberately went to be a piece around Lebron James.  So I guess I'd say he's a franchise-level player, but he bumped himself out of superstar status for the time being. Which makes some sense, some All-NBA voters actually forgot he existed."

"Yeah instead they have Lebron “built different” James, Anthony “force my way out of the Pelicans because I’m a baby and can’t win on my own” Davis, Dwight “corny and annoying” Howard, Rajon “the asshole” Rondo, Kyle “fuckboy” Kuzma, and Markieff Morris, twin brother of asshole Marcus Morris"
I’ve felt that the nuggets have learned something and adjusted every game and that cumulated in a game three win.   I’m not ready to discount lebron James at all but the nuggets have been a great team to watch all play offs and I’m rooting for them HARD
"&gt;Not really no.          You're telling me that if LeBron James was like, ""Hey /u/tayklompson you seem like a cool dude, come hang out at (ridiculously exclusive night club) with (very famous rapper)."" You'd be like, ""Nah bro, I'm good."""

"&gt;Evaluating Lue has been somewhat challenging over the past few months. The raw data hasn't been much different than under Blatt, if not slightly declined in some areas. Factually, the Cavs had a worse record with Lue (27-14) than Blatt (30-11).   &gt;   &gt;However, there continue to be moments when it becomes more clear how much stronger Lue's connection is with the Cavs' core players. Game 1 had several examples. The most vivid were from James, who on multiple occasions made sure to explain how Lue's actions were a factor in the victory:   &gt;   &gt;On the strategy of focusing the defense on Hawks guard Kyle Korver, who got just one shot, and allowing Dennis Schroder a playoff career-high 27 points, James said: ""We had a game plan, and we follow the game plan our coaching staff gives us.""   &gt;   &gt;On what Lue did during second-half timeouts after the Cavs blew an 18-point lead: ""Our coach and our coaching staff are very even keel, and we just try to stay in the moment. ... It's a calm feeling when you come to the sideline no matter if you've given up a lead or not.""   &gt;   &gt;On adjustments that were made late in the game: ""There's a game in between the game people don't see. It's up to us to follow the game plan the coach sets for us.""   &gt;   &gt;This is just not normal behavior from James, to look for ways to bring back attention to his coach. It's not as though that has never happened, but affirming the coach was not a part of the way he operated while playing for Blatt. For the time being -- and all coach-player relationships in the league are fragile and subject to sudden change -- James continues to display that he is invested in Lue's success.   &gt;   &gt;Fair or not, deserved or not, that was rarely the case with Blatt.   &gt;   &gt;Those within the team insist this is a product of Lue being more demanding and setting a tone of accountability within the team. And here is a prime example of how Lue has gone about his business: the Kevin Love conundrum.   &gt;   &gt;One of the issues that plagued the Cavs was end-of-game distrust that frequently existed between Love, James and Kyrie Irving. It was normal for Love to have big first quarters but disappear in the fourth. And it was a compounding problem; Love often wasn't effective late, but Irving and James would often forget about him.   &gt;   &gt;Lue attacked the issue from both ends by getting on James and Irving when they didn't involve Love. But he also got on Love for letting down just because he wasn't always getting the ball. This is the accountability he preached when he took the job after Blatt was fired.

"Omg Dwight is talking shit to guys big deal. Every bad aspect?! Like what are you even talking about. Are players complaining to the media? Are players intentionally looking to injure people? Are players disrespecting the nuggets to the media? We had a bad game and the nuggets outplayed us and now we’re getting ready for the next game. Please enlighten me on “every bad aspect” that has come up.   I don’t get why people can’t just enjoy an epic series with two of the best big men in the league, LeBron James, and a breakout playoff run in Murray. Why do fans (including lakers and nuggets fans) need to bitch and be so pessimistic."
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/education/lebron-james-school-ohio.amp.html  Just one example, takes a second to Google.   What has Giannis done that makes you believe he’s more influential than Lebron?"
[Oh here! didn’t know you needed proof about the free throws. ](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/1966/lebron-james) I hope this clears it all up for you
"Rockets should retire 23 for Lebron James, because he fathered us"
LEBRON JAMES SHOOTINGFIELD GOAL PERCENTAGE  First quarter  64.4% (38 of 59)  Second quarter  66.7% (44 of 66)  Third quarter  40.4% (19 of 47)  Fourth quarter  44.2% (23 of 52)  Clutch  0% (0 for 6)
"ESPN: ""Lebron James headbutts Jerry West"""
"Probably not. Colby can neutralize anything James has on the feet by taking him down. Lebron could power out if it but given his age and lack of fighting knowledge, it would be a hard catch up to counter Colby.  Colby by decision or submission in 4"
"Lebron ""Waterboy"" James"
"I want to see Lebron James on the Celtics, but not out of curiosity.  I want to see him in green at age 40, coming off the bench, having signed for the midlevel exception to back up Williams at center because he is chasing MJ's rings and he knows that this is the only way he can win another championship.  *edit- I also want to see Brandon Clarke on the Warriors. It just seems like it would be great."
I don't believe him. It's a well-documented fact that LeBron James has no regard for human life.
"Basketball is pretty much irrelevant in the UK, I can guarantee you more people in the UK know who Ovie Soko is than any basketball player not named Lebron James, Michael Jordan, or Stephen Curyy. OG whose probably the greatest British player of all time is not even a minor celebrity."
"Lol this guy was trolling in the Nuggets sub, absolutely cringeworthy. Do you have any self-esteem that isn’t derived from LeBron James deciding to rescue your team from its dogshit past decade?"
LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE
LeBron James
"Man its almost like he played for a different team with a different scheme 2 seasons ago then his role changed in the playoffs this season to be more of an on ball defender against guys like LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Kawhi Leonard. But you're probably right, he just forgot how to rebound good"
"&gt;He should think this way, and the fact that he has that belief is what makes the Nuggets so scary.  Its good for the players to think like that but not the fans. Let's say we lose game 2, i doubt we come out as flat in this game. I trust in LeBron James and AD, obviously we couldn't lost both but I doubt it."
LeBron crying about being MVP is eyerolling but James is mostly just a cornball.
How dare him guard lebron James and not get as many rebounds as the guy not guarding lebron lol
"Reminds me of that flagrant foul called on Jamal that cause Lebron to over-react. And Regige goes: ""wow you rarely see Lebron on the floor for an extended period of time""  It's like the homie has never seen Lebron James in an NBA setting before and is bewildered with the concept of LeEmbelishmemt"
"&gt; Now while there’s not a 100 percent match of Lebron James to this supposed “LJ.” Or there’s no real proof if this Jessica is telling the truth. There is however, enough evidence to at least raise some concern. The NBA has a possible steroid problem and Jameer Nelson and possibly, LeBron James could be linked to it.  wow the evidence is so solid"
How is Spo higher? Hes been irrelevant post LeBron James. While Stevens brought the Celtics into ECF three times.
"It's hard to get his 'magic medicine' while in the bubble. Although he's in Florida, still very restrictive.   http://dystnow.com/2013/03/04/lebron-james-jameer-nelson-linked-to-miami-steroid-clinic/"
"He's above Jordan.   Also the people above him are Magic Johnson, John Stockton, Lebron James, Jason Kidd, Tony Parker, Larry Bird, Steve Nash, and Scottie Pippen.   See your comment is dumb as shit because everyone above him, except Lebron and Bird, is a pass first point guard or forward.   You're honestly just trying to stick to a shitty narrative."

"Lebron James was preaching to teammates to remain committed, for all the players to continue trying and stay ready for game 4. It was met by some eye rolls and bewilderment, sources said, because James did not back up his words with action in the first 3 games."
"Dude, that’s even worse. You double LeBron with Kawhi and PG so if Bron nails the pass (which he probably will cuz he’s LeBron James), one of Trezz, Lou Will, or whoever is then tasked to rush to the open man.... if Bron spots AD, that’s an and-1 bucket right there.   Like that’s how Jokic killed the Clippers for a quarter in game 7. They doubled him, and he nailed passes to weakside corners, strongside wing, and cutters."
"It's even weirder that the biggest loss in Team USA history (73-92) is against Puerto Rico. Carlos Arroyo, Eddie Casiano, and Larry Ayuso led the PR squad to victory against the likes of Tim Duncan, Allen Iverson, Lebron James, Dwade, Carmelo Anthony, among others in that team. This was also Team USA's first loss since NBA players were allowed to participate in the Olympics, 12 years prior in Barcelona 1992.   This is one of my favorite memories as a kid. A lot of people in the island still remember what they were doing when it happened.   ¡Viva Puerto Rico!"

Thats not what racism is or means. You literally dont know what racism is and youre labeling people as racist because they brought up that LeBron James is materialistic
&gt;it's just a talking point most commonly used by racists  Bringing up how dismissive LeBron James was of the situation in Hong Kong is a common talking point amongst racists? You wanna rethink that statement? True racism exists in this world but going around pointing fingers at people who aren't racist and labeling them as such is an incredibly dangerous herd mentality.

"&gt; LeBron James... was born on December 30, 1984  Apparently I'm 3 months older than LeBron James. I guess that's not really that surprising but I'd honestly never really thought about it.   Hmm. That... doesn't feel great."
In 2004 I was going to college in a little town in Ohio. They restricted us to 2 locations for about 15000 people. No early voting that we knew about. College had 3500 ultra liberal kids.   EDIT: didn't realize until a second after I posted... this happened to be in Lebron James' home county.  We waited 4 hours to vote. Several locals gave up and went home.  Some politicians make policy that allows for easier voting. Some make it harder. It's always intentional.

Kind of like Lebron making fun of Dirk for being sick then losing to Dirk? Then speaking condescendingly to the entire world because when he wakes up he’s “still Lebron James”. Yeah you don’t. But a lot of people are.

"I really wonder how this post came to be. Did OP start with finding out significant basketball events that occurred around the time that LeBron James was conceived, and arrive at this shit post?  Or did he see the date of the scoring title and then notice LeBrons age? Inner workings of an S Tier shit poster is crazy."
You referring to lebron james' support of the chinese government?
"“So many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually.""  This is what LeBron James said about someone in the NBA supporting Hong Kong.   That is doing something wrong. What do you think the shit show would be if someone in the NBA said the same thing about BLM?  He’s for justice when it’s convenient, which makes him an asshole. He doesn’t care unless it’s impacting his community.   If he wasn’t an outspoken “activist” I’d have no problem with his statement. But it’s textbook definition hypocritical. And to see an American “icon” kneeling to the beliefs of a totalitarian dictatorship running concentration camps is disgusting."

I believe 75% of the time the winner of this award will be the winner of the Finals MVP, but the other 25% of the time it is to show who was the best player in the playoffs even if your team doesn’t win the finals. Prob won’t go to anyone who doesn’t reach the conf finals."
Then there is lebron james who is more athletic then the vast majority of these men at the age of 35. Il
Spending money goes beyond signing LeBron James in free agency. Easy example from last offseason was the Bucks letting Brogdon go for financial reasons.  Teams do things like that all the time and don't tell me Marc Lasry couldn't afford to pay Brogdon.
LeBron James Ironman award would fit perfectly IMO
Lakers-Nuggets game 4 went head to head with Dolphins-Jags on Thursday Night Football and the Lakers game lost. That's pretty bad. It's one thing to lose to something like a Packers-Rams game but Dolphins-Jags is pretty pathetic if it's the Lakers with LeBron James in the WCF.

"LeBron also said he wouldn't play without fans. We know how that turned out...  &gt;“We play games without the fans? Nah, that’s impossible,” James said. “I ain’t playing if I ain’t got the fans in the crowd. That’s who I play for. I play for my teammates, and I play for the fans. That’s what it’s all about. So if I show up to an arena and there ain’t no fans in there, I ain’t playing. They can do what they want to do.”"
Or mobilize all this energy in the primaries for better candidates instead of waiting to become a Get Out the Vote fanatic in November after Lebron James starts shilling for the establishment spokesperson

"Dallas wins 2010, 2011 and has a good shot in 2014, 2015 and 2020.  2010: Dampier/Dirk (25 PPG)/LeBron/JET/Kidd/Shawn Marion/Caron Butler  2011: Pretty self explanatory, they won it all, and then you add a 2x MVP  2012: maybe they win it all, they lost Tyson Chandler, and the core got a bit older, but 2012 LeBron was a monster. I think they make the finals or maybe lose to OKC in the WCF  2013: Dirk is injured most of the year, they lose Kidd/JET and have a bunch of one year guys. Probably 2nd round or WCF, not even MVP LeBron gets past San Antonio IMO.   2014: Dirk returns and puts up 22/6/3 on 50/40/90, Calderon and Monta Ellis are added, I think they win it all personally, but maybe OKC  or SAS wins  2015: I think they have another great shot, They add Chandler Parsons and get Tyson Chandler back. Dirk still is averaging 18 PPG, LeBron probably leads them to the WCF and maybe they beat GS, if they do then they win it all.   2016-2019 I think they lose to Golden State, prime LeBron can't carry 37-39 year old Dirk, Wes Matthews and Harrison Barnes to a title.   2020: LeBron James, Luka Dončić, Kristaps Porziņģis and Rick Carlisle I think are the clear favorites to win it all."

"LeBron James is screaming in the Cavs locker room and there is a bunch of arguing going on. LBJ comes out, says “y’all on that bullshit!” Team is imploding. Blatt, wearing just a towel, swings open the locker room door and requests to speak with The King. “C’mon coach,” he says, “I can’t talk to you like this.”  Eventually, James caves into Blatt’s request and speaks with his head coach in the bathroom. There is still screaming coming from the locker room. After a few moments, LeBron comes out of the bathroom, walks over to Tristan Thompson and tells him, “That man was naked.”"

"What if he didn't say anything about it? Echoing or denouncing Morey's statement weren't the only options. Also, was he in China for [this](https://thinkprogress.org/nba-all-star-lebron-james-refuses-to-be-a-witness-against-darfur-genocide-2d3a8fcc2e29/) one too? Seems like a disturbing pattern."

They would be desperate, and would be forced to do something drastic.  Activism and social justice isn't just about saying shit and showing your solidarity from across the globe to make yourself look righteous.  There are consequences.  Stuff had potential to get really fucking bad on an international scale, and that responsibility was thrown on the shoulders not of politicians or ambassadors who specialize in this type of stuff but of people who play basketball for a living."
There is absolutely nothing undervalued about LeBron James
Do you actually believe the CCP would arrest LeBron fucking James and the Lakers LMAO
"Because he's 6'8, can handle the ball, and is a playmaker. The list of guys with those qualities is like Ben Simmons and LeBron long. He seems to have a good feel for the game and can finish around the rim. Plus every team hopes they can improve his jumper.  This draft is bad, and we saw even less of these players than usual. Who is he up against for the #1 pick?  James Wiseman - sure, he's talented. But he's played three games of organized basketball in the last 18 months. I think he's the most talented player in the draft, but big men are becoming less important every year.  Anthony Edwards - he's cool. But will his style work in the pros? Guys are going to be faster and stronger. He'll have to improve his shot to stay as a guard. If that doesn't work, you're looking at a 6'4 SF."
LeBron James is a black man in America who chooses to focus on the rights of black people in America.  It's not fucking complicated.
"This is the worst writing I've ever seen and everyone trying to explain it makes it even more confusing. Here's my breakdown:  David Blatt is naked with just a towel on in David Blatt's office. LeBron James approaches. David Blatt opens the door, and invites LeBron James into his office. LeBron James doesn't want to talk to David Blatt because David Blatt is naked, so LeBron says to David Blatt, ""C'mon Coach, I can't talk to you like this."" Then LeBron caves and still talks to David Blatt. Then LeBron leaves David Blatt's office, and tells Tristan Thompson, ""\[David Blatt\] was naked."""
"Bron never defended a ""murderous Dictator"" He just said, ""I think Morey needs to think before he speaks""  Which even if he had good intentions is true, Morey cost the league close to a billion dollars from 1 tweet.  Thats money that comes out of everyone's pockets, not just Lebron James, but also the facility works, staff, trainers, etc.  If Morey wanted to see change, he should have gone to elected officials and brought it up. Instead he dragged the most reputable team in China to the ground.  Other execs in the league were all thinking it, Kerr even wanted to say how stupid it is but Kerr didn't have the balls like Lebron."
"So this is interesting for projecting Tatum couple weeks ago [I made a roster challenge for a 5 yr window](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z50z92bz86UUerr4V6JHpvqb4CZBwhEibpbxV-_SS54/edit#gid=1755208056&amp;fvid=1386227081)(which you are welcome to try if you want) and I had to come up with prices projecting for this. I gave weight both to my own evaluations and general public consensus. What I had for top player prices was Luka $58 Giannis $58 Kawhi $57 AD $55 Jokic $53 LeBron $52 Steph $51 Harden $50 Dame $47 Tatum $44 Embiid $41. So htat's 10th.  Now in reality if I was only using my own evaluations I would have Tatum higher. He would be ahead of Dame and Harden at least for me. I didnt do this because I knew I would value older players less and if I made the prices such everybody would just take old players but still you get the point.   &gt;then Tatum is already top 8ish and on his way to reaching a similar height:  I think as is today Tatum is probably top 12ish. Now for projecting if we try to be as objective as possible [here's that same PIPM data site and they have a model for predicting future value lets look at Tatum](https://winsadded.com/nba-pipm-player-projection/)  They say over the next 5 yrs he projects to be $234 in value. From 2023-2025 their wins added projection has him between 12.3-12.9. Data suggests [in 2019 this woulda ranked 7th in the NBA](https://winsadded.com/by-date-player-impact-plus-minus/). 2018 like 6th. 2020 was abbreviated but it was on pace to be that same general range.   So if we are talking about top 3 vs top 6-7 from there it comes down to other things. Playoff performance, narratives etc. Like the past 4 yrs its just an objective fact James Harden has been a better regular season player than LeBron James on totality but nobody would call Harden better than LeBron all that other stuff matters, rings, playoffs etc. So that's probably what it will hinge on.   &gt;and that leaves Tatum as the best SF under 29 years old.  Last thing Id in general be very careful with this type of logic. Things happen in ways we dont anticipate. Look at a top 10 player list, Jokic, Kawhi, Jimmy, Giannis none of them were lottery picks. Dame, Steph were outside the top 5. We often overestimate our ability to predict the future by underestimating these factors we dont see coming, surprises will happen, guys will rise from nowhere."
"**Analyzing the context:**  &gt;As James made his way out of the locker room,  Okay so LeBron was on his way to the locker room   &gt; he was stopped by Blatt who ""swung open the door to his office,""   when David Blatt stepped out his office to stop LeBron  &gt;requesting to speak with The King with just a towel on.   Where David requests to speak to LeBron while only wearing a towel.                                  (presumably after a shower)  &gt;“C’mon Coach,” he said. “I can’t talk to you like this.”  LeBron responds, stating he can't talk to Blatt when he's (Blatt) practically naked.  &gt;Eventually, James caved into Blatt's request and spoke with his head coach.   Eventually James complies, and despite Blatt being almost naked he decides to speak with him (Blatt) in his office.  &gt;After a few moments, LeBron came out of the office, walked over to Tristan Thompson and told him, “That man was naked.""  After the meeting, LeBron walks over to Tristan Thompson talking about how Blatt was naked.  &amp;#x200B;  **In summary:** LeBron was on his way to the locker room when David Blatt steps out his office *half naked* to request to talk to LeBron *in his office.* LeBron initially tries to refuse due to the unbecoming appearance of Blatt right now, but eventually complies and talk with Blatt in Blatt's office. After the meeting (in the office), LeBron walks over to Tristan Thompson talking about how Blatt was *naked.*"
"Should’ve had LeBron James publicly tell people not to do this. I don’t know how big of a difference it would’ve made, but it would’ve been the right thing to do."
"I still disagree with regard to pitcher. Yes they have more of an impact but one pitcher doesn’t have as much of an impact as say Lebron James.   Ultimately everyone deserves credit, but the players deserve the most. A coach and GM are only good if the players execute. Execution is the hardest part and therefore the most important. Arguable the best NFL coach of all time, Bill Belichick, said “players win games and coaches lose them”. Of course in order to be the best you need both - that’s why no one individual should ever get full credit. Again, that doesn’t mean individual players shouldn’t receive praise and credit for performing and executing when it matters most.   As to your last point, that’s a fair hypothetical to make, but it’s not what actually happened. We can’t make determinations on hypotheticals, we have the facts in front of us and we use them to determine our subjective opinion. The same people that say wilt would’ve won just as many on the Celtics are the same that discredit Bill Russel for being on that team. I don’t think that’s fair to do. If you favor individual statistics over winning, that’s fine. But if you’re going to make hypotheticals then you also have to adjust what Wilts stats would’ve been on that stacked Celtics team. Logic tells us that he wouldn’t have put up the same numbers because of his supporting cast. So you give Wilt the benefit in terms of stats and Bill the benefit in leadership and winning. It’s up to each of us to determine which we think is more important, I happen to think the latter is."
I’m black. It’s not racist to say all black men should aspire to be like LeBron James. He’s a role model in our community
Imagine if most blacks were like LeBron James

"Or you're not giving enough credence to Jordan's own ability to fit said system, which to that point wasn't even looked at favorably in the NBA. Erik Spoelstra is a fantastic coach, and the Heat actually did have a system, however they performed less than their teams talent was expected to. Jordan's teams performed better.   It's not ignoring anything, that sort of argument can go on all day (ie, you're ignoring that LeBrons own style of play limits what systems he could be maximized in. For example, replace Jordan with LeBron and while that team would still be great, Pippens role would be significantly diminished so their ceiling wouldn't be as high and you also take the ball out of LeBrons hands significantly in a triangle offense, which is obviously not maximizing his own ability). This isn't NBA 2k where ratings are all that matter  Curry is arguably the most portable Superstar in NBA history (Next to a guy like Bird). THAT is what people focus on. It doesn't matter what system you run or who your coach is, he isn't ball-dominant and can score off the dribble, catch and shoot or in transition, moves a ton off the ball, sets great screens and he's unselfish enough to constantly keep the ball moving. A souped-up Reggie Miller with passing ability on offense. He'd supercharge ANY offense because he has almost no qualities that would negatively impact teammates or their games.  LeBron does, as LeBron is maximized by letting him completely control the offense while he's on the floor. So while he'd still be great on any team, he's obviously not as portable. A team with Magic and LeBron, for example, would have lots of redundancies and wouldn't maximize either player. Whereas you put Curry with Magic and their ceiling would be higher. Jordan isn't as portable as Curry but he's displayed his game is maximized playing in a system where he doesn't have the ball in his hands for longs periods of time.   I'm not sure what's hard to understand about this?  Also, exaggerating by pointing out they complained about it? They literally said they had to change/mold their game and we saw it with our own eyes. Obviously, for the sake of winning, most players would do it, but it still shows that LeBrons game doesn't always allow his teammates games to be maximized, which obviously lowers their ceiling. Here's Ben Taylor of Backpicks pointing this out:  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; LeBron’s one of the more complex offensive players ever to evaluate, not merely because of the breadth and depth of his skill shown above, but because he’s played some of the most ball-dominant roles in history and has redefined the stat sheet as the center of his team’s universe. His on-ball approach is heavier on scoring than pass-first wizards like Steve Nash and [Magic Johnson](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsma02.html), but volume passing *and* volume scoring won’t maximize most top-end talent. Instead, James is the greatest floor-raiser in NBA history, able to do more with spare parts than anyone ever by simultaneously bolstering an offense while upgrading the defense.

And fucking LeBron James lol. That team is beyond stacked.
LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE
Lebron James has 10 seasons with a better true shooting percentage than Kobe’s best season.  Why would I want the much less efficient guy to be the ‘scorer’?  Edit: Kobe is also a .329 career three point shooter. Why wouldn’t I just sag off him and let him shoot threes?
"you’re just ignoring that LeBron initiates a ton of the contact in the first place. he goes in with his elbows up purposefully so guys try to crawl at the ball and their hands come down when he makes contact. let’s not act like LeBron doesn’t have a pretty obvious push-off he uses a ton too. plus the hook on his post spins? dude creates a ton of contact and the defense is allowed to play defense    i think it is pretty crazy after watching how much special treatment Magic, Bird, jordan, and kobe got from refs that the NBA wouldn’t do the same for LeBron. like what could possibly be the reason why the league wants less LeBron James?"
I think Lamelo has never had to try hard in a basketball game in his life and he pretty much knew he was going to be in the NBA no matter what. Whether or not he can flip the switch and have a better motor is the only question on whether or not he can be a successful basketball player. His talent is immense and his passing instincts are only matched by players like Lebron James and Luka Doncic.  He will shock people with his defense and his passing is on a Lebron James/Luka Doncic level. His defense I would say is like a James Harden...someone that can look very bad due to no effort whatsoever but when they want to to clamp down they can play amazing defense. He seems to have amazing instincts on picking the passing lanes and believe he will one day lead the league in steals as well as assists.  If I had to make a comparison I would say he's a 2020 Gen Z version of Jason Kidd.
Oh for sure. It’s because [Kobe Bryant lives inside LeBron James](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGVnyrihEaM/?igshid=a23bjabydh5z).
"LeBron James is American, not Chinese. Don't pretend like you understand the first thing about Chinese politics."
Wow so now the Heat lost in 2011 because they had no bench and not because Lebron James averaged less points than Jason Terry in the finals? You are a clown for thinking let alone typing and posting this.
"I don't agree with that, nostalgia makes us (or them) see the past as better than the present but you just have to watch some clip to realize there's been much more talent over the last 20-30 years than ever before. Just think about if it, how many rings would James Harden have had the played in the 50s or 60s? What about Shaq? Wouldn't have LeBron obliterated the competition? Would Bill Russell himself had been able to stop Giannis?  I agree there are 30 teams now so it might be easier for guys to make it into an NBA roster but until scientists prove otherwise I will maintain a bench player nowadays would be an all star on that era."
"I’ll admit jump shooting isn’t his forte, but he is far from awful. He shut 37% from 3 pt range, very respectable. Also, let’s not forget Lebron has hit an elbow jumper to clinch a championship (2013). I will also point to towards the entire 2018 playoffs.  Apart from that he’s probably the best finisher in nba history, definitely the best passer on that listc, and an argument can be made that he’s the most efficient scorer. He’s only the fourth player to lead the nba in scoring and assists, after tiny archibald, James harden, and Russell Westbrook.  Pretty strong case for best offensive player imo"
That was hillarious though:  Lebron James: \[whispering\] Hail Hydra
Michael Jordon because if he played today he would make Lebron James look like Paul George
"You truly are crazy if you actually think Lebron the person who should be mentioned. Look at his free throw attempts per game for the last few years. He’s never finishing at the top of the league like he should be.  Harden - 11 per game  Giannis - 10 per game  Luka - 9 per game  Lebron finished 18th in the NBA at 6 per game.  2020 Free throw totals  Harden - 916 in 68 games  Butler - 716 in 58 games  Giannis - 710 - in 63 games  Lebron - 531 - in 67 games  For each of the past 6-7 seasons James Harden has attempted anywhere from 200-400 more free throws than Lebron does on a yearly basis.  Harden played 1 more game than Lebron this season and attempted 385 MORE free throws than Lebron did. Jimmy Butler played 9 LESS games than Lebron this year and still attempted 185 more free throws than him. Lebron played 67 games this year, Dame Lillard played 66 games, yet Dame shot 34 more free throws. Trae Young played 60 games this year and shot 29 more free throws than Lebron did.  2018 - 8th in attempts per game  2017 - 10th in attempts per game  2016 - 15th in attempts per game  I just don’t get why you would name one of the players who actually have a legitimate gripe with officials.  You want techs for complaining, what about punishment for awful officiating? What effects more games? Players complaining or bad refs?  So let’s get real about this. Is complaining a problem? Yea it can be, but you’re just blindly talking about this rather than actually examining it."
"I made this the other day.. it’s insane to say Lebron gets to do what he wants when the calls haven’t gone his way in a while.

The refs literally decided to do something that’s never been done before, and they decided the end of a finals game was the best time to do it.   Come on bro... Let’s get real"
Danny Green talks far too fast.  I'm sure LeBron James will be there when the season resumes.  It's not like him to do load management.
"According to the time lengths of the video, I can safely say that LeBron James is the undisputed GOAT."
"Super Big Ball is more likely.  6'9 Magic Johnson and 6'8 Lebron James Height of PG willl be normal.  Wings are more allowed to be smaller, as they only asked to shoot threes most of the time like Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro.  Bigs will be 7 footers and Above. But they will have guard skills. I mean you cannot steal the ball from them easily.  But I would say POST UP will still come back. It just takes one Generational Post Up Player with enough Guard SKills and Athleticism. To change back the league again"
A match 7 worthy of the legend of LeBron James.
This is indeed a strong possibility for the Lakers.  The confidence that came from this first title together for the LeBron James - Anthony Davis duo will strengthen the team for next year.  It remains to be seen how the Lakers will manage the freelance business from now on.
"Right here:  &gt; On draft night, the Bulls traded Kirk Hinrich, a solid and gritty contributor who had helped them make the playoffs in five of his seven N.B.A. seasons, and the 17th overall draft pick to Washington for a future second-round pick.  &gt; It certainly did not make the Bulls a better team on paper, but it did put them $29.2 million under the projected salary cap of $56.1 million for next season.  &gt; That in itself is not enough cap room to sign both James and Bosh to maximum free-agent contracts, and it means the Bulls would have to make another move.  So basically instead of making another move to clear cap space the Bulls actually made a move (signing Boozer) that shrunk their cap space to the point that LeBron would have to take a haircut. Pretty obvious at that point that they weren't getting him. No team was going to hurt their chances of signing LeBron to grab Boozer lol  Wade even talks about the cap issues a little here: https://www.nba.com/bulls/gameday/dwyane-wade-tells-story-2010-free-agency"
If Lebron James is a top 3 player all time who makes 100 million a year and you call him trash. What does that make you??? 🤔

"Think of it as weight. Having boxing training gives Jake paul another 20 pounds. So his 189 + say 20 so he’s say an average guy of 209 vs nates 177 plus 10 for athleticism. 209 vs. 187.   You could argue boxing experience / training is 30 pounds extra weight.    Lebron James 265-285, Jake paul gets demolished."
"I meant in terms of pure talent. Dennis was playing the backup to CP3, Shai and Ferguson/Dort, he should be fine to playing backup to LeBron James, even if he would prefer a starting spot(who wouldn't?)."
The day he decides to do that is the day LeCoast becomes a 100% of Lebron James. As opposed to the 40% now
LeBron James would destroy Colby Covington dude lol that’s not even close to the same thing as saying Nate would beat Jake Paul. Weight/size classes exist for a reason and LeBron is literally nearly double Covington’s weight and height. You don’t understand physics and mass if you can’t recognize that
A “your mom” joke in 2020. Bravo. You’re right Kawhi is such a better basketball player than LeBron James. Riveting takes you’ve got
"Sixers (1st):  &gt;The Sixers went big across the board. Ownership confirmed the worst-kept secret in the league by going all-in to get Morey when he and the Rockets parted ways. The team went all-in to get Rivers instead of Mike D’Antoni and others who’d been linked to the head coaching gig after Rivers and the Clippers finalized their unexpected divorce. Morey and his new front office moved quickly to improve the roster by adding proven shooters in Green and Curry to surround Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons; Broekhoff went .373 from deep last season in Dallas. Maxey’s no shooter yet (29 percent on 3s at Kentucky), but he’s a talent. Good intel on Howard’s year with the Lakers convinced Philly that he could work as Embiid’s understudy, a position the Sixers thought Horford would fill last season. They (and those like me who agreed with them) were wrong; he and his big contract are now in OKC. Everyone comes to Philly with something to prove: Morey still seeks to pilot a Finals team; Rivers has to overcome his Clippers going belly-up against the Nuggets in blowing a 3-1 series lead. Excellent work all around by Josh Harris and his ownership group. That is a sentence I have rarely written, if ever.  Lakers (8th???):  &gt;It is instructive that GM Rob Pelinka was not at all sentimental about the team that won it all. The Lakers did not hesitate to replace Playoff Rondo with Regular Season Schröder, the latter being younger and much more dynamic on the ball. Matthews will step right in for Green. Harrell and Gasol have a lot more to give to complement LeBron James and Anthony Davis on offense than McGee and Howard did. But a lot of veteran brainpower and defensive heft in the middle has gone out the door. The Lakers won it all because they became a shutdown defense, and because Rondo and Howard were outstanding in supporting roles in the postseason. I don’t see that going forward with this new nucleus, though Gasol is still really smart and is still a solid team defender.  Thunder (30th):  &gt;As I always have to write for the team ranked 30th: this doesn’t mean I hate what OKC did this offseason. The objective here is to determine whether a team is better or not after the offseason. And any objective analysis of whether the team that will take the court at Chesapeake Energy Arena this season is better than the one that took the court last season would conclude the product isn’t as good. Having said that, the Thunder’s plan to acquire every pick in every NBA draft through 2031 is proceeding quite nicely. And there is a serious method amidst the seeming madness.  &gt;OKC is methodically stashing high-upside international talent like Pokuševski and Krejci that will cost nothing on the parent club’s cap (and bringing over another stash that Philly took in 2014 in Micic); taking fliers on athletic players that haven’t yet panned out in the league like Leaf and Jackson — and, of course, methodically adding to its trove of future draft picks by flipping veterans it brings in for that sole purpose. (As Oubre told me last week, they’re very professional about it.)  &gt;I’ve lost track of all the firsts OKC controls one way or another through 2025, but the long play for the Thunder is clear: someone from among Houston, New Orleans, Philly and the Clippers, to name just a few of the teams the Thunder’s done big future trade business with in the last 18 months, is going to have an unexpected down year between now and then, maybe more than once. And OKC will be the beneficiary. None of this helps Daigneault, OKC’s former G League coach, in his first NBA head coaching gig. Assuming Horford isn’t re-routed, he will be the graybeard on an otherwise insanely young roster."
"Those raptors stood about as much of a chance as the romans did at cannae.  Boom, Jake Paul = LeBron James = Hannibal Barca"
"There are high level talents at his position on the Lakers ... namely LeBron James and frankly the other guards in front of him are better defenders than he is. His job is to come in and give the offense a jolt as a secondary creator, he's not here to do a Kyrie impression.   Does this quote strike you as coming from a guy who's prepared to sacrifice to win? Because to me it sounds like it's coming from a guy who has a large agenda outside winning and that's the last thing the Lakers need."
That's a myth.  They didn't want to pay big money to Isaiah so they moved him to a different contender to play with LeBron James and have a chance to win a title.  Hayward and Horford both got huge money to play elsewhere.    The team has been pretty good about finding good situations for their vets if they decide to move on.
I was shook when he hit those. Fucking LeBron James. Legend.
"I think folks see his APG numbers and associate 4-5 APG for a center as being a good playmaker.  That's not to say Bam doesn't have good vision or that he is a bad playmaker, because he does have good vision and is a decent playmaker for a center, but you have to consider the situation he is in. He plays on a team that has great ball movement, as well as lots of spot up shooters and slashers. There is not a traditional PG on the Heat so the ball finds itself in a lot of players hands, meaning you have four or five players that average 4-6 APG each, rather than one guy who averages 10+ APG a la Steve Nash or Luka Dončić or LeBron James. Put Bam Adebayo on a team with Harden, Luka or LeBron and his assist numbers go down for sure."
"The problem with all these brands is that they don’t get that no matter who they sign, no matter how much they try to shove it down our throats, you’re not going to take a chunk of Nike.   They’re miles ahead in recognizability, r&amp;d, design and pretty much anything else.   If Lebron James left Nike today and started a new brand under New Balance, I guarantee every single retro Nike Lebron would outsell anything that NB puts out.   These companies keep dumping money but it’s for a lost cause."

idk why you are downvoted for calling Lebron James a nerd this made me laugh
"I thought that tale was even more bizarre than that -- it was Blatt, not Bron, who was the one who was wearing just a towel.  &gt;Funny postgame moment: As James was leaving the locker room, Blatt -- wearing only a towel -- swung open the door to his office and called James over to him.  &gt;""C’mon Coach,"" James said. ""I can’t talk to you like this.""  &gt;He did, though. James obliged and after the two briefly chatted, James turned and walked toward Tristan Thompson. ""That man was naked,"" James said.  [source](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2016/1/5/10716514/cavaliers-david-blatt-lebron-james-naked-maybe)"
"He does not project to be a long term turnstile on defence. He has shown flashes of really good defence and has all the tools to be a positive defender. Millsap has said that MPJ can be an elite defender if he puts in the time to learn nba defence. You have to realize this is a kid who hasn't played 2 and a half ncaa games, 2 years ago and was thrusted into playoff basketball as his first time starting. He was getting targeted by Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Kawhi, PG, Lou, and Lebron James. They'll make most defenders look stupid, let alone a kid who hasn't played in any meaningful basketball game."
I miss classic nicknames like this. We need to revive that part of nba lore. I wanna see pure 70s nicknames. Lebron “Jivin” James. Steph “Bubblegum” Curry. Ben “Sweet Papa” Simmons.
LeBron James
"eh, don't be pedantic, replace ppg with Drtg, Lakers have a pace of 100 so both are similar.   &gt; Based on what? Like there is no basis for this claim at all  the basis is that Lebron fucking James would be free to do whatever on defense. of course the defense isn't getting worse. it's a no brainer."
I agree. He probably makes life much easier on Lebron and I’m sure James is all about that easy life during this season.
"well, we clearly disagree on the defensive value of Lebron James being free to help / double team on defense.   I think it will improve the Lakers defense by 4-6 ppg a game, you think it have small to no effect 0-1 ppg."
"LeBron is an asshole about the number.  &gt;""I just think what Michael Jordan has done for the game has to be recognized some way soon,"" James said. ""There would be no LeBron James, no Kobe Bryant, no Dwyane Wade if there wasn't Michael Jordan first.""   &gt;   &gt;""I feel like no NBA player should wear 23. I'm starting a petition, and I've got to get everyone in the NBA to sign it. Now, if I'm not going to wear No. 23, then nobody else should be able to wear it.""  For LeBron to switch to #6 after saying that shit about Jordan and everybody else was an insult to the great Bill Russell, who *actually* paved the way for these guys as a civil rights champion with dignity and character. Jordan paved the way for global marketing deals.  Side note:  the Heat having retired Jordan's number is one of the most pathetic decisions in sports history."
"This is one breathtakingly stupid take. So you watched Kawhi Leonard tear through the Orlando Magic and 6 games against the Sixers averaging close to 40ppg on 70% TS and you're surprised that he finally has a bad shooting game? Have you not taken a basic statistics class in college? Do you not know what regression to the mean is? I haven't even mentioned the fact that hes forced into a ton of bad shots because the entire team other than Ibaka choked so hard they're passing up wide open shots and being too scared to shoot.  You also must not have watched much basketball if you've not seen Lebron with abysmal shooting nights. Lebron James shot so badly in an entire playoff series he averaged 17points and got destroyed by a team hes heavily favoured to beat.  Also, are you seriously comparing Kawhi to Demar? Who the hell trades for Kawhi Leonard to have him pass the basketball. You need to work on your basketball iq...i mean just IQ in general."
"&gt; Durant feaasted on lebron in all of their finals matchups, lebron actively looked to switch off of him all the time.  Yes because as I said, Kevin Durant is an unrealistic expectation for any defender, let alone one who's already burdened with the majority of the offensive load.  &gt; He guarded rose for like 8 possessions and they blitzed and doubled him, the one tiny example of him guarding a point, and he didn't eat his lunch lol.  From ESPN's Stats and Info Department, ""After going 0-for-5 from the floor with a turnover when guarded by LeBron James in Game 4, Derrick Rose struggled against him once again Thursday, going 1-for-10 with two turnovers in Game 5. Rose shot 6.3% from the floor in the series when defended by James, lowest among any player that defended him on five or more plays."" So no it wasn't just 8 possessions and I'd consider 6.3% lunch.  &gt; Jokic feasted, what is this? Dwight was hacking and bumping him non-stop, but you are going to give him credit for like 5 switches?  Giving Lebron credit doesn't mean Dwight doesn't get any. I'm just proving that when necessary Lebron can guard 5s.   &gt; Pau worked him on switches, Kg did, Duncan would have if lebron ever tried to guard him lol, david west worked him, jokic did, shawn marion scored on him, he didn't guard dirk   Based on what are you saying this? You can't just name random bigs lol. I don't understand why people are so insistent on denying his ability to guard 1-5. Do I need to show evidence or something? Here's lebron guarding an allstar [wing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hkh4Nnz9Ie8) [guard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2r45koedTE) and [big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L_X2_sIHOI)  &gt; gerald wallace was the main offensive weapon for charlotte, ak-47 had a sizable role in every offense he was in, marion was a 20 ppg scorer, artest was too before the suspension?? yet all still took primary assignments and provided the helpside defense that only lebron can lol.  none of these guys had a fraction of the role lebron did on offense lets not kid ourselves. Apart from maybe Marion and Artest, they weren't better defenders than Lebron anyway. Lebron doesn't get extra credit for not trying, its a massive criticism of his. We just acknowledge that when he tries, like in his Miami days and right now on the Lakers, he's one of the best defenders in the league. Stop exaggerating and saying 'he's never showed that'. Nobody gave him DPOY votes for fun"
Lebron James always been a class act. We’re humans and we all make mistakes for sure but you see a hs freshman kid talk and act like this and you just have to really think what a good heart this guy has always had
"Well that would make sense if Lebron James played on the same team as those guys, but he doesn’t. So try again."
"Brook Lopez, Middleton, Wesley Matthews all had a higher +/- than Lebron James. I think you need to come up with a different reason."
lebron james or kyle kuzma? who should the lakers really be building their team around? hmm.
lebron james
"&gt;Since he commonly gets compared to a young Kidd  First time I'm hearing this. LeBron James, Magic, jumbo Rondo, Lamar Odom, etc I've heard. Kidd? Never. Only player I remember being compared to Kidd is Lonzo Ball."
LeBron James......... your joking right? LeBron has been at best an average defenders for at least 4 years now.
LeBron James
Other than Lebron James the reigning NBA champion and best player in the world?  Even with the contract and agent give me LBJ and another 💍
"&gt; If he was consistently the best player at his position for a whole decade while other players swapped in and out for best player at their position, then there's a high chance he was the best player in the league then, hmmm? Especially considering NBA had a ton of elite guards during his prime years such as Wade, Iverson, Nash, Kidd, Paul, Deron, etc.  I don't understand the logic here? Other players swapped in and out, as they left their peak and exited but Kobe was never the clear no.1 .   &gt; You know if you pass the ball to a player and he makes a basketball move and then shoots, the player that passed still gets an assist right? Yeah, that's Kobe's career.  What is this even supposed to mean?  &gt; And you're talking about makes. Look at his misses. You answered your own flaw on how statistics is wrong. Kobe wasn't a mediocre 3 point shooter, he just shot way too many shots he should not have shot. Bad shot selection doesn't make you a bad 3 point shooter. If he was a mediocre 3 point shooter, then how can he make an NBA record 12 (at the time)?   Ok, let's say Kobe really was a great 3 point shooter.  (even though he didn't even attempt more 3s than league average for most of his career) You agreed that Kobe took too many bad shots, this reduces his efficiency to a below average one. Purely looking at how it impacts the score, does this make him any different than a mediocre 3 point shooter who has better shot selection but still has the same efficiency? No, you don't get extra credit for tough shots. Kobe may have been a much better 3 pt shooter if his shot selection wasn't bad, but we're here to talk what happened, not hypotheticals.  &gt; And Nash was never the best player in the league, are you kidding me? Lol. He was an exciting player and the best PG in the league but his defense was pedestrian and he had a stacked team at his disposal.   At this point, you've seemed to call out everybody who has a differing opinion for their age. Now I have to ask, were you even alive then? Sure his defense was pedestrian, but what makes up for it is a top 5 offensive peak all time. All of the top 3 offenses ever by rOrtg were led by Nash. Nash did have a strong supporting cast, but it's clear that he could dominate without them, like when he won 57 games in 2006 when Amare missed the whole season. Why on earth would a 2 time MVP not have an argument for the best player in the league?  &gt;  KG never achieved anything in Minnesota so no one is ever going to call him the best player in the league at any point rofl.  KG never achieved anything because of his team. Minnesota was arguably the worst run franchise. Not only were they unable to find solid help for KG, they literally weren't allowed to by the league because of the whole Joe Smith nonsense. Now for 12 years, Garnett waited in Minnesota, and the best help they ever found for him was Latrell Sprewel in the last 2 years of his career. And as KG hit his peak, what did he do? Carried what was literally a 7 win team without him to 58 wins and the WCF, and set the record for highest RAPM in a season. Don't confuse team accomplishments with individual ones.   &gt; Duncan has an argument but in no way is a 20-10 PF ever going to be the best player in the league when there's a Jordan-esque guard averaging 30-5-5. Duncan was never better than Kobe during Kobe's prime years, he was always one of the best players but never the best.   Calling Tim Duncan a 20-10 guy is the most idiotic thing I've heard in my life. The man who anchored the best defense in the league for a whole decade and a half, and you narrow him down to a 20-10 guy. This is why we need some real advanced stats sometimes. Most people don't know how to interpret box score numbers correctly. Duncan's highest BPM in a season is 8.5 and his highest WS/48 is .257. Compare that Kobe's with 7.6 and .224 . This isn't even accounting for the fact that box score stats can't measure defense accurately.   &gt; Take your fake Lakers flair off and put on a Stephen Curry flair or LeBron James flair on because that's who you truly root for.  Suddenly because I don't rate Kobe extremely high I can't be a Laker fan? Being a Laker fan doesn't mean I have to be delusional, I can appreciate Kobe for what he did to our team and not overrate at the same time. In fact if you go through my post history, you'll find a post in r/nbadiscussion where I claimed that Kobe was top 5. Obviously I don't believe that now, but in case you think I hate Kobe, there it is."
This is another problem with this comparison.  Lakers were really the only party realistically in that race for AD.  Celtics backed out and the Lakers had literally nothing to lose by their recent seasonal history. If I got 35 wins with Lebron James I’d send half my team to NOLA too.  None of the contending teams that can afford Tillman’s asking price are in a position where they either can’t just ride it out a bit or aren’t already setting up for a certain free agent that will just cost them massive cap.
"I thought about that but figured that someone like LeBron James would then be confined to like one team when he had multiple years worthy of being among the best. I can definitely make one where it's players can only be on one team, in which case I'd probably take 2019-20 Jimmy Butler for the Heat seeing as he led his team to the Finals shooting less than 30% from three lmao."
"&gt; Why are you quoting redditors as if they are credible reporters  I quoted Rondo and you wanted more, so I gave you Redditors who watched LeBron's entire career.   &gt; “He killed the [Lakers’] chemistry,” an anonymous NBA executive said of James to Pincus. “He shouldn’t have been so public about it. Even during the all-star draft, he laughed about [wanting Davis to be his teammate].”  &gt; According to Joe Vardon of Cleveland.com, some of James’ teammates have begun to complain that the four-time NBA MVP has recently been slowing down the game with his ball-stopping.  &gt; “Players have grumbled that James has slowed the ball movement, holding onto the ball until he sees an ‘assist’ pass, rather than moving it quickly,” he wrote.  &gt; If Cavs head coach Tyronn Lue has noticed a similar trend, it’s possible that he was referring to James when he told members of the press that his players need to abandon any personal agendas that might be getting in the way of collective success.   &gt; “I never really get concerned,” Lue said after the Cavs loss to the Toronto Raptors. “We’ve got to be better. We know that. But until we play better defensively, I think offensively sharing the basketball, everyone on the same page, and if guys have agendas, we’ve got to get rid of our agendas and play the right way.”  We have clips of LeBron shoulder bumping coaches, then getting them fired. What more do you want?"
"You're really out here trying to make fan opinions hold any amount of importance on the distinction of whether or not LeBron James is a good leader. LOL  That guy was right, you really are a closeted Warriors fan. Who else would be hating so hard on LeBron."
"Why are you quoting redditors as if they are credible reporters   “The meeting in Memphis was a retort of sorts. In what became an open forum, several players spoke up. Players focused on James’ inconsistent body language throughout the year. The four-time MVP copped to the critique, telling his teammates that, in essence, cutting out behaviour like slumped shoulders and sideways glances has been something he has tried to work on his entire career.”  ""McMenamin said it appeared that James took the critiques to heart, as he showed a bit more focus on lifting teammates, staying engaged and putting his arms around other players during timeouts.""  Thats an explanation from an actual respected reporter about your first situation. A story of lebron taking on his teammates advice, admitting fault and trying to do better"
"&gt; “When guys are making the same mistakes over and over and over, it’s hard to bite your tongue but I tried to get [James] to focus on his body language.  &gt; “Those young guys were looking at everything he did. If they missed four shots in a row and LeBron was making a face, it was crushing to them. He was their Michael Jordan. They didn’t want to let him down.  All while LeBron tells Lakers to trade the young Lakers squad for AD then telling them not to get distracted lmao. Horrible leader."
"Either I’m getting shadow band for, or I responded to the wrong guy. It says in my history that I sent you the comment two hours ago? Check my history it’s the one where I talk about the Cavaliers, the Rockets and the Warriors are being able to beat the clippers  And you said that they matched up really well against the Warriors which is just a subjective theory. Not saying that they couldn’t beat the Warriors were just saying if they couldn’t beat the Rockets and the Warriors beat the Rockets four games to one, that doesn’t farewell for your argument that the clippers could beat the Warriors  And literally any team could dominate Timothy Mozgov interest in Thompson… The thing is you were going up against LeBron James. Since we’re coming up with hypothetical situation so I don’t exist, who’s to say that Kevin love and Kyrie Irving also don’t get hurt? What if all three are playing? You’re going to tell me that a Clippers team with Jordan, Blake, and Paul was going to be able to contend against a team that’s basically all LeBron James? The Cavaliers were not a team effort"
"&gt;The reality is that AD demanded he be traded to the Lakers.  And that trade can't be made if all you're offering is Lonzo, Hart, and Kuzma. Yes, I read the same shit you did but they still had to create a package they'd accept. They traded Brandon Ingram by guy, they didn't exchange shitty players for an All Star just cuz they're the Lakers. Celtics fans were laughing at the Lakers core before Lebron got there.   &gt;Yes the Lakers did well, but don't kid yourself into thinking that they pulled out some genius move getting Lebron and AD. I coulda figured that one out given that both Lebron and AD basically shipped themselves to the Lakers.  Who called it a genius move? They positioned themselves well and got Lebron to buy in BECAUSE of the talent they had drafted. Yes it's LA, but you're kidding yourself if you think he still goes to LA without them being IN THE POSITION to trade for another All Star. Took em a long ass time to get to that point but they still had to hit on at least one lottery pick and they did.  I'm simply not trivializing an NBA championship like you are, it's literally the whole point of this sport. Win or compete for a championship. Hell yeah they deserve credit. You can have a Lebron James lead team and not with the chip, people love to talk about how easy it is to just get Lebron but that only takes you so far. Their team building and coaching hire were laughed at.  I'm not criticizing the Celtics for not trading for AD, you're arguing against something I'm not even talking about. I've found this whole thing funny because Lakers fans have pretty much everything over Celtics fans and there's not much left to cling to **in that specific rivalry**. Even when the Celtics are in the ECF and the Lakers are in the lottery, the Lakers were able to win a championship in less time. They should have the right to make fun of the Celtics for years IMO"
"he took more threes maybe because he couldn't get to the rim because you know, covid, a respiratory disease impacted him.. and also, the whole coming back from an injury quickly...   and honestly, in 5 games vs the lakers, he was bad in 2, average in 1, great in 2   like game 3 - him and harden did enough to win, they lost because the other team had LeBron James and Anthony Davis   game 4 - he was really good, James Harden went 2/11 and had 21 points, i don't see how that's his fault  i think it would have been a disappointing showing as in they would have lost still, but Russ wouldn't be questioned as much at all if he was healthy"
"There's a difference between tanking and rebuilding and I think one of the biggest mistakes that people make is conflating the two.  I also think that one of the biggest mistakes that teams make is trying to force the end of a rebuild instead of letting it happen organically. In my opinion teams should usually be more interested in acquiring future assets, rather than paying market value for players on the free agent or trade market unless those moves are going to elevate the team to a title contender.  When you take a look at a lot of the teams that ""never tank"" and aren't in top FA destination cities with arguably a top 5 coach in the NBA the number one thing that links these teams is that they acquire and develop a lot of young talent. You don't necessarily need to tank to get that young talent, but when you're a bad team that has been bad for an extended period of time you aren't likely to have assets to kick start a rebuild any other way.  Buying your way to an NBA championship just isn't possible. With the possible exception of LeBron James, you just can't pay market rate for talent and assemble a team that will be able to win a championship. The best way to get undervalued talent is through developing young players."

"Correct. LeBron James is very muscular, weighs more then Giannis actually. This guy gives terrible takes, don't try to explain yourself anymore lol."
"I mean when you discuss who's the better basketball player you don't operate under the assumption your team is gonna have a top 5 player to lead the lesser guy to a ring. A vast majority of franchises are taking Harden because they don't have a LeBron James. Likewise in a fantasy draft scenario or a scenario where you don't know who the teammates are gonna be you take Harden every time, you're never going to assume you end up with another top 5 player, you take the guy that you know FOR SURE is gonna win you more games.  If you're taking Harden in 80% of scenarios hes just the better basketball player. Its wonderful that AD may be a better fit alongside LeBron James but he's not a better player than James Harden and its extremely obvious to anyone who's been following their careers closely before this season."
"12 PM (ET) ESPN - Milwaukee Bucks @ Miami Heat - A rematch of their 2nd round playoff series, Giannis goes up against one of the teams he is most likely rumored to join.

"""Not everyone is LeBron James""  Bro.. You don't need so much money that you cant possibly go broke lol"
It’s hating cause at no point has Kawhi Leonard done “everything” better than Lebron James
"Harden. I’d like to see what AD does with any of those Houston teams. Him and CP3 would be CP3 and Blake 2.0, but that also includes the injuries.  It depends where honestly, but more often than not, superstars don’t usually have the luxury of playing with another superstar, no less LeBron James.   Therefore I’d take harden in that he’s a positive in every possible scenario, whereas AD is marginally better but only in some scenarios."
"I don’t think it’s fair to judge a 6’0 tall player on his ability to switch. I think it’s even more unfair to judge him by his ability to guard LeBron Fucking James. The only man who stops LeBron, is LeBron, and he hasn’t done that since 2011."
"I said nothing but facts. Sorry that you don’t like it. But I get it, you’d rather forget that no matter who the Boston Cavs meet in the ECF y’all just won’t be good enough.  It doesn’t matter if it’s LeBron James or the 5th seed in the east."
"Ben Simmons, Marcus Smart, OG Anunoby, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Giannis, Mikal Bridges, Jrue Holiday, Jonathan Isaac, Kris Dunn. Fairly sure those are safely the top 10, in no particular order."
One played with LeBron James. I think saying “AD doesn’t hold a candle to Luka” is an exaggeration. But you’re acting like AD carried the Lakers to a ring.
"Almost a day later and it seems pretty accurate so far. There are 2 major things that I see wrong with it though: 1) Why is Steph Curry higher than LeBron James on this list and 2) Why is Kawhi Leonard on the second page behind Donovan Mitchell? See, I get that Mitchell did great in the playoffs but Kawhi is still a top 5 player guys."
Lebron james is the best player jordan was better than  peak shaq is the best player lebron was better than
One of my favorite dunks ever.  This one  JR Smith flying  Tom Chambers two handed  LeBron James over Tim Duncan  Pau Gasol over Duncan and Robinson
"This is also true of nearly any sport. I played tennis competitively growing up. LeBron James is a much better athlete than me. But even if you give him 6 months to train, there's almost no chance he beats me, because even the best athletes can't build the skill needed for most sports to beat someone who is actually decent at them.  The only reason people think fighting is different is because we inherently think of fighting as a pure test of athleticism, rather than a sport which requires a mix of skill and athleticism."
"The thing is, as good as bam is, you don't win championships by having such a player with a max contract. Looking from recent years, LeBron James, steph curry,  Kevin Durant, kawhi Leonard, these are the caliber of players that championship winning teams had on a max contract"
"Yeah but you understand the context of the comment being ""Lavar Ball's son and Lonzo's brother and so lets gamble on him"", which isn't the same as ""lands us Lebron mf James"". Ed Davis and Anthony Davis have ""literally the same name"""
LeBron James is one of the most well known men alive. Nobody else in the NBA is even close to that level of notoriety. He’s absolutely the face of the NBA.
"Exactly the only person who can ever take over the established GOAT(Michael Jordon) has to be someone who is ""destined"" to do it. Someone like LeBron James."
"Exactly, Heat would not have the best record in the league by miles without Lebron. It's equivalent of giving a MVP vote to James Harden in 2016, and explain that Rockets (8th seed) would be a lottery team without him, thus Harden was more valuable. The logic was just plain dumb."
"I disagree. With the fully random method, you’re getting a lot of junk data. There’s zero value in someone rating Kawhi Leonard over Juan Toscano-Anderson. In order to get the best consensus sort, you need to start reducing the window within which you’re sorting so that voters make decisions that matter. If Lebron James and Giannis are 1 and 2 with 20k responses but only 100 people actually voted on that matchup (numbers pulled out of ass), then you didn’t really get a good consensus understanding of which player is better according to the community.   I suspect this method gives you a pretty good overall spread from best to worst, but isn’t going to get you the best resolution when you look closely."
Let's see jake paul vs lebron james.

Your weird worshipping of Lebron James makes me uncomfortable
"Of course not LeBron but I would take Harden over AD.  Harden is one of the most durable players in the league and has never missed the playoffs in the western conference.  AD is basically the best #2 in the league, while James Harden is a top-5 #1."
"This was the entire point of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar famous  skyhook  https://youtu.be/uxm88cFu6UM?t=49  In his younger years especially, Kareem would release the ball at such a high point that it was going down towards the basket as soon as the ball left his hands.  This made the shot virtually unblockable, apart from the very rare player such as Wilt Chamberlain,  who could occasionally block the shot as it was leaving Kareem's hand  Kareem's unblockable shot is one reason why I rank him as the second greatest player of all time.  He's behind only the king himself, LeBron James."
[This is what I found from googling it](https://thesource.com/2020/09/21/lebron-james-sends-message-to-ufc-trump-supporter-colby-covington-anybody-can-talk-from-outside-the-ring/)
"mike would make lebron james jaw sore for atleast 2 weeks, just because you’re athletic doesn’t automatically make you a good fighter, yes in the typical street fight being stronger/faster and having more stamina than someone will help, but it’ll just boil down to if you know how to fight, a 6’2 225 pound swole athletic build guy who’s had a couple fights in his life time vs a 5’10 175 pound amateur boxer with merely 1 year of training... 9/10 the boxer takes the fight,"
LeBron James has been underpaid $200 million dollars during his career.  For just $5 a month you can help LeBron recover this devastating loss.  Text LePoor to 5555 to start giving.  Thank you.
I would take lebron james
Imagine saying this while Lebron “may be hurt financially by China” James is the face of the nba
"""We have no clue why Nate thought this would be a good idea. We're launching an investigation to see why his agent would agree to him fighting someone 4 inches taller, 20 pounds heavier and with more boxing experience.""  - Chris Paul and LeBron James, soon."
"&gt;Jake would knockout lebron james and thats fact. this sub would cry cause they dont wanna believe it to be true.   that's a no from me dog, i agree with the rest though"
Lebron james.
"Just put I don't know, then reason why... I don't know enough about Lebron James to answer"
"Tf you mean? You realize the NBA is already doing backflips to get all eyes on Zion. They literally made the play in tournament in the bubble so the Pelicans could make the playoffs. Zion is THE most hyped prospect since Lebron James. He’s going to be in every Christmas day game, opening night, etc. Zion is box office."
Jake would knockout lebron james and thats fact. this sub would cry cause they dont wanna believe it to be true. Actual boxing skills and experience&gt;No boxing skills and experience. Nate was fighting like he thought he was in the hood scrapping. Jake actually fought professionally and schooled him
People love to hate Jake paul and thought just because nate is an athlete he would destroy jake paul.. truth is Jake could probably Knock out 90% of nba players (One of them being lebron james)
"Lmao trust me there are threads about this, weight class matters yes in the professional sense but not outside. People look at the Mountain vs Mcgregor sparring match and think everything is gonna be like that. Lmao not everyone is a near 7 foot 450 pound of muscle, even still id take Stipe or any of the top 10 heavyweights over Halfthor, vs a 155 or less opponent against Thor.  Really don’t get how there are a SHIT TON of people that think LeBron can take on a world class professional fighter and wrestler just because of a 60-70 pound difference. LeBron has 0 fight or wrestling experience and Colby is the #1 welterweight contender in the world. You’ll find threads on here after James’ comments about someone shitting their pants"
"Yes I agree, although you severely underestimate the advantage Jake had based on training. Combat sports are not like other sports. There is a very specific skillset that can only be gained from years and years of training. Its the reason that Lebron James would get pieced by even welterweights in the UFC, or any similar comparison. Its also pretty odd to not point out that Jake was an all state wrestler in Ohio, which is very difficult, and has also been an athlete his entire life. Again, not saying that Nate's performance wasn't embarrassing, but to say that this was not the expected outcome is pretty dumb"
"Going back and looking at the 80s MVP voting onwards.   Getting 90%+  - Moses Malone, 83.   - Larry Bird, 85.   - Larry Bird, 86  - Michael Jordan, 96  - Shaq, 00. Missed by 1 vote.  - Kevin Garnett, 04  - Lebron James, 09  - Lebron James, 10  - Derrick Rose, 11  - Lebron James, 13. Missed by 1 vote.  - Kevin Durant, 14  - Steph Curry, 16  Steph absolutely deserved unanimous, but so did arguably these players too. It being unanimous requires luck as well, unfortunately.   edit: Chuck got fucking robbed in '90."
Jon Jones vs. LeBron James next please :P
Nah I seriously doubt Lebron would be able to avg 10 more points and match his best season of efficiency ever even if he had more usage. He was able to be so efficient those 2 seasons because he had Wade and Bosh. ISO is usually not an efficient offense for anyone not named James Harden.
We’re too invested in them trashing our favorite players to make other players look good. Ex. See the microcosm that is Lebron James hot take coverage.
"It's almost as if he's Lebron James, player often compared to Michael Jordan, considered one of the greatest players to ever seen foot on a basketball court."
"""I am playing defense this year.""   -  LeBron James"
"Cavs improved every year with Irving until James came. He had none of these issues then, as he got the success he got worse which obvious was put out in front with LeBron there."
You're telling me I can't compare Bob Cousy to LeBron James?

"Ah yes, Wes Iwundu scored as much as LeBron James. As expected."
"50/50?????????  LeBron James in his prime with Chris Bosh and Dwayne Wade won 2 championships. And he's only won 3 his whole career. Jokic and these nuggets are talented and dangerous, but winning a championship is very, very hard. I'd put their odds much lower"
Lmao he is always putting the blame on his teammates with the classic [gesture](https://www.complex.com/sports/2019/03/lebron-james-reactions-meeting-lakers) which he got called out on.
Then why is Lebron called King James when his name is Lebron?
"Holy fuck I feel bad for Marvin. I don't want to be patronizing to him but he can be a top PF in the league with some All-NBA nods in his peak.   A LaMarcus Aldridge/Chris Bosh kinda player. Which is good, but not good enough to be taken right before the 2nd-coming of LeBron James."
"Lebron James: ""I don’t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Javale [about his support to free the people of Buckets]. But I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech but there can come a lot of negative things with that."""
"learned from the best  lebron ""we need a playmaker"" james"
Wow.  Lebron James and Dwight Howard combined for 20 assists and still lost
Markelle Fultz just took over and won a game featuring Lebron James
Welcome being a Lebron james team
"LeBron James, spot up shooter."
Lebron james
me so i can get free chicken wings.   &amp;#x200B;  but for real I want Lebron James on there.
"I still remember my mom texting me when she was watching his games. I am not exaggerating when I say that I don't think my mom know who Lebron James is, but she watched Jeremy Lin."
"A lot of real ballers, even past pros? Most people understand his defense is otherworldly, and that he does do good things on offense. Most players today praise him. The best player in the entire NBA, Lebron James, who works as hard as anybody, nicknamed Ben Simmons the Young Prince. He doesn't throw around that lightly, and hes a basketball genius you dumbass"
"For starters, Lebron is 3-6 in the finals so let's not speak of him like he's Jordan and act like he hasn't had failures in his career and say he's a ""real fucking winner"". Lebron is obviously better than James Harden, no one is even talking about him here so it's incredibly irrelevant to what you are even trying to prove.   Harden has a bad game and you two clowns act like without him Houston would even scratch the playoffs in any of the years he was here."
"Kobe is better than Lebron once and for all. Has almost twice the all nba defense awards, is the better scorer, better free throw shooter, 2 more championships, MJ said he's better, the next day he embarrassed Lebron James at the all star game.    ""Kobe Bryant Embarrasses Lebron James at the All Star Game""    https://www.nbclosangeles.com/local/all-star-kobe-bryant-lebron-james-chris-paul-lakers/2056002/    This sub is young!"

"Lebron just a couple months ago for non basketball reasons. People fucking hated him for the China debacle. Went from Qing James posts to how is he still doing this, posts."
ESPN: Lebron James to add on Trae ???
"A couple people changed their opinions on Lebron James in 2010 and Kevin Durant in 2016, I forget why though, some stuff."
lol he was hurt for a bit in the first half of the season but he was healthy the second half and couldn't get his team to win games and then gave up on the season...so you don't think Lebron James should be in the all star game I guess
LeBron James 2016 Finals  Dirk Nowitzki 2011 Finals  LeBron James 2018 vs Toronto  Steph Curry 2016 vs. OKC
"You're literally downplaying every advantage Jordan has while giving LeBron the benefit under the same circumstances.   ""Jordan might be better on defense but not by that much""   He won MVP and DPOY, 200 steals, 100 blocks AND led the league in scoring in the same season.  LeBron has never came close to doing something like this. He was basically the best player in the league on both sides of the ball at the same time.   ""Also the offensive side of the ball is more than just scoring. While Jordan is, once again better at that part, LeBron is not that far behind"". You then go on to say ""when it comes to play making LeBron is vastly superior"".   How is he ""vastly"" superior ? If you're going to use the ""assist"" argument, the difference in Jordan and LeBron assists is 2 assists. LeBron is better at putting teammates in position to score, but to say he's ""vastly superior"" at it is... exaggeration to say the least. But on the other hand, you're  going to say that LeBron isn't far behind Jordan in terms of who's the better scorer? Jordan's skill set is vastly superior to LeBron's. In almost every way. LeBron has playmaking and the 3. Jordan was a better shooter, free throw shooter, he's better at the rim, he's better at driving, better foot work, better post game, better ball handling, better offensive rebounder... offensively it's not even close... Unless you're going to try to argue statistics...  ""Free throws go to Jordan but those aren't really that important""   James Harden is literally leading the league in scoring by a lot because of free throws.   ""Then you get to rebounding where LeBron is better"".   Is he a better rebounder though? I mean he's 6'9 250 and a Forward. Jordan is a 6'6 195lb shooting guard... But the difference in their rebounding is 1... And Jordan was a better offensive rebounder. Given the size difference, position and offensive rebound numbers I don't think you can actually say LeBron is a better rebounder unless you're strictly arguing statistics."
LeBron James
"Jimmy Butler, Lebron James, that random shooter on your bench who normally sucks, Ish Smith"
LeBron James absolutely cares about his legacy.
"remember the game where lebron hit game-winner vs bulls in game 4? blatt didn't want lebron taking that shot, he wanted lebron taking it out of bounds. also in the same game he called for a timeout when the team didn't have one which should've resulted in a techinal in a tie game late. this is what brendan haywood said about blatt and the things that added up:   &gt;I remember last year telling somebody on the team, ‘I love David Blatt. But if we’re in a close game, he can’t help us,’. That’s not a shot at Blatt. But … David Blatt can’t come to a huddle and draw up a play that would get us a good shot. David Blatt doesn’t understand sometimes substitution patterns.  &gt;The mistake he made against the Bulls when he didn’t have the ball in LeBron’s hands at the end of the game… There were obvious mistakes he was making, and you start to see it as a player, where ‘We’re going to have to win this on our own, because he can’t do for us what Gregg Popovich can do for the Spurs. He can’t take advantage of a mismatch the way Steve Kerr did in the NBA Finals – Steve Kerr made it so it was hard for us to play James Jones. They attacked him every time he was in the game."
"Players with stats equivalent or better than Ja Morant:  Lebron James   Anthony Davis   James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Luka Doncic   Nikola Jokic   Damian Lillard   Rudy Gobert   Donovan Mitchell   Bojan Bogdanovic   Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   Chris Paul   DeMar DeRozan   LeMarcus Aldridge   Brandon Ingram   Devin Booker   Kawhi Leonard   Paul George   Karl Anthony Towns    With Ja Morant, that makes 20.  Is Ja better than 8 of these?"
"that cavs team would've had a winning record even without a coach. as far as i understood, it wasn't much about in-game stuff, players didn't respect him off the court (lebron wasn't the only one). i think haywood summarized the situation pretty well in this article: https://cavsnation.com/brendan-haywood-gives-eye-opening-revelations-about-david-blatt/  &gt;Coach Blatt was very hesitant to challenge LeBron James. It was one of those situations where, being a rookie coach, and LeBron being bigger than life, it was a little too much for him. I remember we had James Jones [talk] to Coach about how, ‘Hey, you can’t just skip over when LeBron James makes a mistake in the film room.’ Because we all see it."
"Arenas was easily the James Harden before James harden, in terms of scoring, and crazy 3 point range. Obviously the games opened up a lot, and Harden takes a bunch of threes and scores a mind blowing amount; but Hibachi was just one of the best scorers in the league, up there with Kobe. He had it all, floaters, deep 3’s (they used to say “that’s from Arenas range”) He could lay it up, and he was clutch.   If I remember correctly he had a game winning 3 pointer against the Jazz and he turned around, and put out the 3 fingers, all before the shot fell. So Gilbert was maybe never top 5 but easily top 10. Kobe, Lebron, KG, Pierce, T Mac, Carter, Nash, Duncan, etc. Point is there were PLENTY good players in those days."
Out of current players? Of all time? Lebron fucking James
My old college professor was good friends with Isaiah Thomas. He taught my small physical health class for about an hour and talked straight basketball. He said that after you pass your physical prime you enter your mental prime. The best example of this is Lebron James.
Yeah he played great as the number 2 option to LEBRON JAMES but how about his track record as a number 1 option? Like did you even watch last years Bucks v Celtics [series](https://youtu.be/jUBsqfkBmYE)?
You guys failed to reach the postseason with LeBron James.
Who was better? LeBron James or his father Jerome James?
He’s taking up after his role model Lebron James.
"I think it’s hard to conclude that a relatively shallow decline like that is due to only surgery and not the natural decline in athleticism that every NBA player not named LeBron James has gone through. I think if his decline were due to the surgeries, it would be more pronounced and have taken a more drastic and acute dip. To me, his athleticism has declined, it’s not unnatural though."
Players age 21 or younger to average at least 25 points and 5 assists in a season  Trae Young  Luka Doncic  LeBron James  Michael Jordan
&gt; as soon as James declines even a little bit they’re out of contention   As soon as LeBron declines from being arguably the best in the world to what merely top 10 they're out of contention? What a silly statement siakams.
This guy isn’t impressed. Your attitude towards this stat reminds me of how Skip Bayless reacts to every Lebron James accomplishment.
"I am, unlike LeBron James who stands in the corner and looks at his phone the whole time."
Absolutely. It will be like having a second LeBron James out there. You'll barely be able to tell which is which.
"Gary Payton, Kobe, LeBron James (defends Draymond), Kevin Garnett (defends KD), David Robinson/Hakeem."
"I don't like our depth. Kuzma will be unplayable in the playoffs. He is easy to defend because he can't dribble and can't finish consistently in the paint.  Avery Bradley is a good defender but without lebron on the floor. He ain't serviceable in the offense.  Danny Green will lit up for 20 points in one game and play mediocre for 5 straight games.  Cook, Dudley, and Daniels are like kids hanging out with the adults. Don't get fooled by our record but we have one of the worst 12th to 15th man on roster.   Also Lebron and Davis chemistry is extremely exaggerated by media. They win games well because they are superstars but their chemistry ain't as good as steph-klay.   Also Lebron James doesn't play defense like what people say in this sub. He doesn't rotate and help on defense.   Lastly, one of the reason this team can't dominate fastbreak/ quick scoring despite having lebron and davis on the receiving end because nobody wants to inbound the fucking ball. Goddamn I miss lonzo"
This season a guy named LeBron James is playing really well and I can argue that he can make the same impact as anyone you've mentioned
"Magic Johnson  Kobe Bryant  LeBron James  Hakeem Olajuwon   Wilt Chamberlain    Matchup wise, I’d put Kobe on Steph since Magic would somewhat struggle on a quick guard, but would work guarding Klay. Defensively, Steph is struggling guarding either.  W/ the backcourt settled, I’d feel confident putting LeBron, in his prime of course, matchup w/ KD. His athleticism, strength, &amp; IQ we’re at it’s best then &amp; would out-duel KD.  Hakeem is out of position technically, but he has the agility/elusiveness of a 3/4. He’d be able to guard Draymond, especially since he lacks a dynamic offensive game + work him in the post w/ his footwork &amp; post game.  Lastly, at center, the only player whose strength is comparable to prime Shaq is Wilt. He’d be the best option to push Shaq off the block &amp; make him settle for more jump hooks than comfortably w/."
	Giannis Antetokounmpo 	James Harden 	Anthony Davis 	LeBron James 	Joel Embiid  	Nikola Jokic 	Durant 	Curry 	Kawhi Leonard 	Jimmy Butler  all these guys i'd put above rudy but one deep playoff run and Rudy could overtake one of these guys easy.  Bonus:         Paul George 	Luka Doncic 	Damian Lillard 	Pascal Siakam  tl;dr Is Rudy Bogert top 10? i don't think so. not yet. is he top 15? maybe/yes.
PG - Chris Paul   SG - Michael Jordan  SF - Kawhi Leonard  PF - LeBron James   C - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
Allen Iverson x Lebron James x Derrick Rose. But I’m with you... he is simply just Ja.
"Connor is a piece of shit, but LeBron James is literally top 1% of role models in the world"
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
Do you think ~~LeBron James~~ Joel Embiid would still be the best player in the league if he had to wear sandals every game?
"&gt;I actually said this to Tony Robbins because I read something about LeBron James a while back, about maybe a year ago, that he spent $1.5 million annually on his health: his nutrition, his training, his everything. And I spent nothing.  Sounds exactly like me"
"Yes, but have you seen what LeBron James did to Toronto?"
LeBron James.
LeBron James
"The Cavs have had two firsts since lebron, Dwight was drafted by Orlando first, Andrew bogut by Milwaukee, James worthy was first overall like 2 years after magic, and Houston drafted Yao first in 02."
"Potential Assists Per Game, per NBA Stats  1. LeBron James - 18.9  2. Ricky Rubio - 16.9  3. Luka Dončić - 16.6  4. Ben Simmons - 16.5  5. Trae Young - 16.2  Trae is averaging more MPG than any of these except Simmons, so even if he’s creating the least points off of assists per game, he’s still doing so in the same amount of time. And that’s with a top 5 usage rate (only shared by Luka in this list).  NBA Stats also has an Adjusted Assists Per Game stat. Leaders:  1. LeBron James - 12.3  2. Ricky Rubio - 11.2  3. Luka Dončić - 10.8  4. Trae Young - 10.5  5. Ben Simmons - 9.8  Adjusted Assists probably isn’t a perfect stat, but it does account for some different factors."
"I don’t think the first one can be done because there’s simply not enough data out there on it.  1. There’s a small sample size of superstars going to small markets.  2. Individual sales figures for teams are not reported, especially in small markets.  3. You would have to be able to control for a lot of other variables, such as overall sport popularity in the market, moving trends, the individuality of that superstar and if it can be replicated (think: LeBron James vs. Anthony Davis), etc.  The second I have no idea since the description you gave is very vague."
"You know who else didn't go to college?  LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant..."
"Some highlights I found interesting:  - Knicks Trade Marcus Morris to Heat  - Sixers Keep Al Horford, Acquire Alec Burks from Warriors  - Suns, Cavaliers Agree on Kevin Love Trade  - Derrick Rose Rejoins LeBron James with Lakers"
"&gt;I actually said this to Tony Robbins because I read something about LeBron James a while back, about maybe a year ago, that he spent $1.5 million annually on his health  Conor McGregor and Tony Robbins in a room together.  Is this what hell looks like?"
"Cont.   LAST SEASON THE Heat were 10-14 in games decided by five points or fewer and just 19-22 at home, where they let winnable games slip away. They missed the playoffs by two games and were full of regret.  With one of the league's best closers in Butler leading them this season, the Heat have made a huge turnaround in their clutch-time execution. They're a dominating 6-0 in overtime games. At home they've been almost untouchable, going 17-1.  ""There's a reason why we chased him so hard, and backed up the Brink's truck to get a max player,"" Spoelstra said. ""That was the idea: to have a guy that we believe can take us to a different level.  ""That's what he's doing right now.""  Butler is averaging a career high in assists, making the Heat's offense go without a traditional point guard and allowing Dragic to settle perfectly into a sixth man role -- one he has arguably played better than anyone in the league this season.  Butler also espouses all the principles of ""Heat Culture"" -- to the point where Spoelstra thinks about what could have been had the Heat drafted Butler in 2011 rather than Norris Cole, two picks before the Chicago Bulls took Butler with the final pick of the first round.  ""It felt like he should've been with us all along,"" Spoelstra said with a smile. ""All along. I was joking about it with [Heat senior adviser] Chet Kammerer. ... I was saying, 'Man, looking back on it now, how great would Jimmy Butler have been drafting him after that first year with the Big Three?' Could've slotted him in with LeBron be the point, Dwyane, Jimmy be your 3, CB, Shane ... that team could've gone on.""  That is an alternate reality. In this one, the Heat are hoping Butler can be the lure to stars in the way Wade, his fellow Marquette product, was 10 years ago. Yes, Riley was able to persuade James and Bosh to come to the Heat in that wild summer of 2010 -- but that happened only because Wade was already there.  Part of why the Heat struck out in free agency for several years was they didn't have anyone for stars to play alongside -- just one of the reasons Bosh's medical retirement was so devastating. Butler, they hope, changes that.  ""I'm just here to hoop,"" Butler said when asked if he thought about the future possibilities for the organization when he agreed to come to Miami. ""I'll let Coach Pat, Coach Spo and everybody else in the front office deal with all of that.  ""I just know that I wanted to be here, I am here, and whatever we do, if we stick with this team, our job is still to win. We're locked in right now, and we'll worry about the future when it gets here.""  THE ASCENSION OF Adebayo might prove as important as the addition of Butler. Adebayo is an ideal fit for today's NBA -- athletic enough to switch onto virtually anyone on the court and skilled enough to dribble and pass like a wing. The differences between Adebayo and his talented but less versatile predecessor at center in Miami, Whiteside, are glaring.  ""Our organization is built on: You've got to earn it,"" Adebayo said. ""I feel like I've earned the right to be here and they're letting me expand my game.""  The max contract handed to Whiteside in 2016 is as telling as any of Miami's other questionable deals. He frustrated the Heat with his inconsistent effort. When asked about how Miami was winning despite Butler's modest numbers, Spoelstra referenced Whiteside repeatedly without ever mentioning his name -- even alluding to a postgame interview in which Whiteside said he was ""trying to get my NBA 2K rating up.""  The Heat have surrounded Butler and Adebayo with the type of under-the-radar finds the Heat are known for developing. Kendrick Nunn, winner of the first two East Rookie of the Month awards this season, was an undrafted free agent the team signed at the end of last season. Duncan Robinson was on a two-way deal with the Heat last season and has developed into one of the league's most accurate 3-point shooters. Chris Silva is on a two-way deal and is playing himself into a full roster spot down the road, while Tyler Herro has looked like a potential steal with the 13th pick in the draft.  Spoelstra credits Butler and Dragic, veteran players who have allowed those younger guys to take on specific roles, an assessment Robinson agreed with.  ""For sure,"" he said. ""Both those guys, particularly on offense, get us organized and get into stuff. It makes it more palatable for us. Particularly for myself, I know my job is to be aggressive on offense, space the floor, shoot it when I'm open, and sometimes when I'm not, and defense, just compete, be in the right spots, contain the ball and just focus on what's in front of me instead of getting too far ahead of myself.  ""They've both been awesome.""  The Heat are third in the East, back among the elite. They'll keep looking to add another star this season or this summer, though any such deal could cut into their ability to get a big free agent in 2021. But any doubts about Riley's ability to make a major move should be suspended. Riley is feeling lucky.  ""I'm an Irish guy,"" he said. ""I sling shamrocks around to my friends all the time. It's my favorite emoji."""
"PAT RILEY'S INCREDIBLE track record aside, it was hard to take him at face value nine months ago.  ""Whether you believe me or not, we're at the launching pad right now,"" Riley said during his annual postseason news conference. ""We've been through this now a long time. We know how to do this. We have done it in a myriad of different ways. We're going to figure it out.""  Riley's Miami Heat had missed the playoffs for a third time in five seasons. The Heat were capped out and had gone from chasing stars to overpaying role players. As a result, as the rest of the NBA was about to embark on one of the wildest summers of player movement ever, Miami seemed doomed to be relegated to the sidelines.  Riley, though, was undeterred.   ""Don't make any conclusions that we're stuck with certain contracts. That would be foolish thinking,"" Riley said. ""There aren't any obstacles, there are only opportunities.""  The Heat front office saw something they thought doubters were dismissing. Their choppy last few seasons aside, they believed their franchise and the city of Miami hadn't dimmed as drawing cards. They felt they didn't need cap space or high draft picks to make it happen. They needed only a star who wanted to be in Miami.  Sure, the Los Angeles and New York teams were rivals, but that was nothing new. The Heat had beaten those teams for stars in the past. Riley and his trusted lieutenants firmly believed an active marketplace played to their favor, and 2019 free agency would be active.  Once again, the old master was proved right. It showed in his wide smile as he sat alongside Jimmy Butler last July, the landing of a star that has become a turning point. To some, it was an unexpected sign-and-trade. As Riley predicted he could, he unloaded Hassan Whiteside's bloated expiring contract, creating the path for Bam Adebayo to elevate from role player to second star.  In short, the Heat are back, and back to doing what they've always done: gathering stars and contending. From Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway to Dwyane Wade and Shaquille O'Neal to the ""Heatles"" of Wade, LeBron James and Chris Bosh, Riley has done this time and again since joining the Heat 25 years ago.  Now the Heat are on the hunt for another big catch. Whether it's a member of the desirable 2021 free agency class or some other star, Riley has one more chance to create a Big Three on the shores of Biscayne Bay.   THIS REEMERGENCE OF the Heat as a force comes after five difficult years. James left in July 2014. Bosh re-signed, but recurring blood clots derailed his career. That they appeared for the first time just as the Heat were trading for Goran Dragic was a cruel twist of fate. All of it set the stage for Wade's ugly -- albeit brief -- departure.  The failure to sign any major free agents -- namely Kevin Durant and Gordon Hayward, on whom Miami put a full-court press to land -- was a reversal from the success the Heat had previously enjoyed.  As a result, the Heat changed tactics. In 2017, on the heels of failing to get Hayward, and after just missing the playoffs following a 30-11 close to the regular season, Miami invested heavily in non-stars. The Heat made more than $100 million in four-year investments to retain Dion Waiters and James Johnson -- deals that remain millstones around the team's neck.  ""There aren't any obstacles, there are only opportunities."" Heat president Pat Riley ""That's on me. You can put that all over me because I'm the one who made the deal at midnight [on July 1, 2017],"" Riley said last year. ""I didn't want the two guys on someone else's team, which would've been an even worse scenario.""  Riley also gave free agent Kelly Olynyk a four-year contract that summer. All of that followed the Heat's decision in 2016 to match a $50 million offer to reserve guard Tyler Johnson.  In settling for role players, the Heat adopted a slogan and hashtag to justify the method: ""Heat Culture."" And in fact, the Heat's culture has long been considered among the best in the NBA. But culture didn't deliver rings to Riley in Los Angeles and Miami -- stars did.  ""EVERYBODY IS LOOKING for a star,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Not everyone, though, can land them. Riley has proved, time and again, that he can.  The man proved to be a wizard of a coach and one of the league's great innovators. But Riley's best work has always been getting stars -- and getting the most from them.  By the time last season ended, Riley had made the course correction and was vowing to return to his roots. That's what led to his brash proclamations. While the Heat were proud that they always competed hard, and swore they enjoyed the chase for a lower playoff seed, they had reached a decision to get back to being the old Heat.  Riley admitted it might take until the summer of 2020 to get a star, and he hinted he might even have to pay a surcharge to dump some of his bad contracts. But once Butler became an option, Riley pounced.  General manager Andy Elisburg executed the sign-and-trade that required four teams to pull together. Complicated deals have long been an Elisburg specialty, whether it was the five-team, 13-player mega trade they executed in 2005 that stocked their 2006 title team, the Eddie Jones sign-and-trade in which Elisburg had 20 different machinations of Jones' contact in 2000, or the James and Bosh sign-and-trade deals in 2010.  The Heat were doing Heat things yet again."

He referred to LeBron as LeBron and Harden as James throughout the entire piece. Why would he change it up at the end?
I cannot explain how fun it is to watch LeBron James' teams.
It is not fair lebron james single handedly taking over the ball game!!!
Lebron James is the most effortlessly great player in history.  Lakers are garbage time GODS
LeBron James still the GOAT
"How much better would the Blazers be if they got Lebron James, Jimmy Butler and Popovich"
god LeBron James is so good
LeBron James is so good at basketball
"https://www.nba.com/article/2017/04/12/blogtable-what-criteria-matters-most-making-mvp-decision      &gt;Shaun Powell: In this particular case: Have I seen it done before? And the answer is: I""ve seen what Harden did before, seen what LeBron did before, seen what Kawhi did before. I've never seen a guy average a triple double. And I don't understand why this is even a debate.      &gt;John Schuhmann: My vote went to the individual who had the biggest effect on why a good team was good. That was the guy averaging 29 points and 11 assists for the No. 2 offense in the league. The Rockets had the league's third-best record primarily because of their offense, and James Harden put up historical numbers running the show.      &gt;Ian Thomsen: I love this award because it’s all about value: who has done the most for his team? Which is why, in my view, LeBron James is usually the player to beat. It has taken extraordinary numbers by Harden and Westbrook to beat out LeBron. In the end, as much as Westbrook has done for the Thunder, I believe Harden has done a little bit more.      &gt;Lang Whitaker: I'm doing my best to keep it simple: Value. I'm trying to vote for the player in the NBA who is the most valuable. (FWIW, I also hate that whoever you choose is somehow also seen as a total rejection of the other candidates. I can appreciate greatness on multiple fronts!) And you can throw new-fangled stats and numbers at me and summon the Fun Police on me if you want, but to me there was no player in the NBA who was more valuable to his team and his teammates (and fans of the game, if you want to include the entertainment factor) this season than Russell Westbrook.       It's not that weird of a concept to say a lot of voters don't think about defense. Two guys interviewed there mentioned defense and one of those still went Harden/Westbrook."
I’ll just leave this here:  https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/07/11/628137929/episode-427-lebron-james-is-still-underpaid
Not a Cleveland fan? You literally have a Cavs flair lol. If your just a Bron fan switch to [NBA] LeBron James flair
Predictions:  2003. LeBron James: All time Great  2004. Dwight Howard: Great  2008. Derrick Rose: Great  2009. Blake Griffin: Great  2010. John Wall: Good  2011. Kyrie Irving: Great  2012. Anthony Davis: All time Great  2014. Andrew Wiggins: Decent  2015. Karl-Anthony Towns: Great  2016. Ben Simmons: Good  2017. Markelle Fultz: Decent  2018. DeAndre Ayton: Good
Or maybe it's really fucking hard to find a #1 championship option so teams make due with who they have?  Not every franchise can just draft LeBron James ya know.
"Not every trademark applies to all uses. LeBron, from a NYT article, had an LLC file for a TM on Taco Tuesday:  &gt;The company seeks protection for use of the phrase in a host of forums, including “downloadable audio/visual works,” podcasts, social media, online marketing and “entertainment services.”  So that would not infringe on Taco John's trademark, but this ESPN article does actually contain a quote saying that what I said was the purpose, was in fact the whole purpose, and why it was denied:  &gt;""The applied-for mark is a commonplace term, message, or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment message,"" the USPTO wrote.  &gt;A spokesman for James told ESPN's Dave McMenamin that the application was filed ""to ensure LeBron cannot be sued for any use of 'Taco Tuesday.'""  &gt;""Finding 'Taco Tuesday' as commonplace achieves precisely what the intended outcome was, which was getting the U.S. government to recognize that someone cannot be sued for its use,"" the spokesman said.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27596576/lebron-taco-tuesday-trademark-filing-denied"

"My point was last year, you could make for exemple Taco Tuesday and have some kind of sale rate.   This summer, Taco Tuesday or 🌮 Tuesday   gears from any print shop or a taco tuesday social media handle would have a Spike in viewers.  https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=taco%20tuesday  If  you look at the interest over time  from 2004 to present. There is a huge spike that sticks out of the history. It also shows that is started in June this year and was higher in the CA, AZ and NV.   That spike is what LeBron was trying to keep away from dwellers and opportunists.   As you seen with Spencer Dinwiddie(making his contract a stock option), Lonzo Ball (trying to license a brand to a Big Shoe  company, LeBron James(Self branding over team branding) Shaq(Record Deal) Jordan(Shoe deal) or Junior Bridgeman( Franchise empire), setting the precedent to new ways to make money is big business. So I don't think it was an attempt at making himself the inventor of it. He wanted to block of any business es that would have tried to make money off it now while it's hot."
"wait, when he says most people would say healthy KD and James, isn't he talking about Lebron?  But then he'd pick harden over both?"
He literally has chosen1 tattooed on him.  Lebron didn't adapt to drama. Lebron James is drama.
"Don’t have a favourite team so all players are a go  1. Steph Curry  2, James Harden  3. LeBron James"
"Bro people post threads on whether LeBron James would be as popular if his last name was Jim, highschool mixtapes, and WNBA highlights. Does any of that happen to do with the NBA either?"
"I don't think Kawhi wanted to or even thought for a second that he would be more popular than LeBron James. Even though he sees himself as his equal and more than likely thinks he's better at basketball than LeBron is, I don't think Kawhi is a moron. I'm sure he knows there is almost nothing he could do in this world to make him even just as popular as LeBron James is.   I also don't think being one of the most popular players in the league was ever one of his goals if we're being realistic."
Fun fact: Lebron James is 1st on the list of players with most wins in the past decade. 2nd place goes to Serge Ibaka
**Fuck that script** - Lebron James.
Yea I just saw LeBron James
Saying Boyz 2 Men are going to butcher a song is like saying you could block a Lebron James dunk
"In Game 3 of the 2017 NBA Finals, Lebron James played 45 minutes and 37 seconds of 48 minutes, and was +7. The Cavs were -12 in the 2 minutes and 23 seconds he sat. Kyrie Irving played all of those 2 minutes and 23 seconds."
Stat passer? Lebron James breaking records and passing the likes of MJ on the all time scoring list is one thing.   Ive never thought of Drummond as a “stat passer” like Lebron.
Only one team in the past decade has won a championship without an elite defense. That team had LeBron James
"Props to Dan Gilbert, Koby Altman, Collin Sexton, LeBron James, and Cleveland for letting this happen"
&gt; Lebrons cavs were again one of the best defensive teams in the league for most of the tenure.  You keep saying this. Do you know who the best defensive player on those Cavs was? It was Lebron fucking James. Guys like Booker put up the 27 points but provide no defense that's why the stats don't translate.  &gt;You're also blatantly ignoring that the suns have openly tanked the last few years.   Except Sarver and Booker publicly claimed they would win and are trying to win and are sick of losing.
there are people who don't want Lebron James playing for their team?
"Yeah I'm serious, are you? A dude like Nikko Hurtado (speaking of LA artists) is booked fucking months in advance based on his work, not based on the celebrities he tattoos. He has celebrities on his waiting list all the fucking time. Those who don't wanna wait, just walk into any parlor or to some dude who markets himself as a celebrity tattooer. The best tattooers in the industry cost thousands of dollars and have each day and each session planned out for months. Their work is shared on their instagram to hundreds of thousands of followers and goes into their portfolios. Nobody is paying these guys thousands of dollars because they tattooed Lebron James, they're paying them because they saw the work they've done and want work of the same quality"
Pretty sure tattooing Lebron James is far better business than telling some random that sorry gotta cancel your booking today. Lmao like are you serious right now?
So the third best player on the Bucks team is better than ???  You aren't owed shit because of your record.  Lebron James didn't carry his entire team to the all-star game.  Neither should Gianns.  Do you expect the entire all-star team to just be the Bucks?  GSW had four all-stars because they literally had 3 hall-of-famers on their roster.
Looks dope. Can you imagine hearing in 2010 that Lebron James will eventually be on the Lakers and have a Kobe Bryant tattoo?
It’s Lebron fucking James lol. I’m sure any great tattoo artist would accept him for walk ins.  Especially when it’s to honor the greatest player of that city
They will for Lebron James
Lmao you really think any artist wouldn’t drop everything they have if Lebron James walked in?
"So you're arguing that the word of the person in question, the dude that's reportedly self-conscious about media reports of his weight, the guy that steps on the scale every morning, is unimportant?   Or are you just misunderstanding what an official source is?

"1 ) Bron was a starter, so fans voted him in a la Trae Young this year   2 ) You just fuckin compared Devin Booker to Lebron James, what ?"
"Very smart to do it the other way, prevents all the comparisons and lets us just focus on the tribute.   Can you imagine all the clickbait titles? ""LeBron James thinks he's as good as Kobe, steals his number"""
"Is the 1988 All-NBA team the best All-NBA team? Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon. Honorable mention to 2006. Steve Nash, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Dirk Nowitzki, Shaquille O'Neal"
LeBron James
Thanks for disambiguating LeBron (James) and Giannis (Antetokounmpo) from the other NBA players with those names.
"Volume shooters pad their stats with lots of shots. Booker is scoring over 27 points per game with over 50% shooting and 6+ assists per game, only other players to do that? LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird... I would label that a volume shooter..."
"To all of the idiots on here saying a few of the following things, in one way or another:     * Start playing better and stop complaining. * CP3, Westbrook, Lillard, Mitchell, etc., are better. * &lt;insert tired double team, pickup game joke&gt;. * Corny response. * Win more.  Play better? CP3, Westbrook, Lillard, etc., are better THIS SEASON?      **The only other players in NBA history to average 27 PPG and 6 APG on 50% shooting in a season are LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Steph Curry and Oscar Robertson.**      **No NBA player had ever averaged 27 PPG and 6 APG on 60 TS% and missed the All-Star Game until Devin Booker.**  Devin Booker’s true shooting percentage is 10.8 points higher than Russell Westbrook. Booker bested Westbrook in every single important advanced metric and shooting efficiency.   Here’s how Devin Booker ranks in advanced metrics compared to his competition for an All-Star spot (Mitchell, Paul, Ingram, Westbrook, Morant):     PER = 1st   TS% = 1st   VORP = T2nd   BPM = 2nd   OBPM = 1st   WS = 2nd   PPG = 1st   How the hell do so many of you idiots exist, much less reply on this post when you CLEARLY don't know a damn thing about Devin Booker. You clearly don't know how amazing the guy is. He's having a top 5 as it relates to offensive efficiency, ALL TIME season.     You should have your basketball knowledge cards checked and revoked at the /r/nba door. Damn fools."
1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Stephen Curry 6. Anthony Davis 7. James Harden 8. Paul George 9. Nikola Jokic 10. Damian Lillard 11. Joel Embiid 12. Klay Thompson 13. Russell Westbrook 14. Chris Paul 15. Luka Doncic
So they both have lost more than they won on every team they’ve been on without LeBron James? Also winning is a team thing. The ineptitude of the suns should be taken into account for this.

"Cool dude. But there are people that dont have parents, or their parents arent around, or they get left home all the time in front of a TV because their single mom has to work two jobs to put food on the table.  Unfortunately, not everyone is as lucky as you to have parents that actively can teach them what or what not to say or do. Lebron James has spoken countless times about the weight that falls on him as an example to young black boys without fathers, but I guess that means nothing to you.  People in major spotlights are nearly always accountable for what they say, and should be mindful of the impact they have. These are the only role models some kids have, but it seems like you are too callous to even realize that.  Maybe you should get out of your own neighborhood every once in while and realize not everybody has the same privileges and life you do. Not everyone gets to be an engineer and have an education. Grow a little fucking empathy and realize that everybody has a role to play in fostering the youth, especially the people that society elevates.  But you sound like the kinda guy that swears in public in front of children and then states 'its your freedom of speech', so I wont be holding my breath"
LeBron James was on a shitty team last year and made the all star team.
Wait... What? CP3 is like number 7 all-time assists leaders behind Oscar Robertson and ahead of Lebron James.
"Apparently, LeBron James. He's just hitting his (seventh?) Prime."
"Are you actually trying to argue that Booker should make the all star team over Lebron James?     There’s a lot of hills to die on, this one ain’t it. Lebron deserves to make the all star team over booker every single year until he retires."
i agree that booker should be an allstar this year.  that being said if you're trying to say that Lebron James and Devin Booker are comparable just because they had a similar ppg and shooting splits you're out of your mind
He stopped being on the same team as Lebron James?
"Assisted points 10.5 Screen assisted points 16.8  Total points assisted 27.3  LeBron James  Assisted points 25.8 Screen assisted points 1.4  Total points assisted 27.2  Look it up. Very significant stat. Very.  The Heat were an absolute trashcan before Jimmy for years.   We’ve seen the least amount of top ten picks of anyone in the league for the past 30 years always remaining competitive while being a smaller market that doesn’t attract big free agents.  Bam has no jumper, no post game and can’t create his own shot for shit.  He’s the biggest beneficiary of playing with a bunch of 3 point shooters and Jimmy. Layups, Dunks and putbacks pretty much sum up Bams offense.  He’s extremely limited offensively. It’s a fact.  A superior basketball team?   Your 32-15   We’re 31-17 and haven’t had our best player the whole season while losing a ton of other key guys to injuries the whole year.

We’ve seen the least amount of top ten picks of anyone in the league for the past 30 years always remaining competitive while being a smaller market that doesn’t attract big free agents.  Bam has no jumper, no post game and can’t create his own shot for shit.  He’s the biggest beneficiary of playing with a bunch of 3 point shooters and Jimmy. Layups, Dunks and putbacks pretty much sum up Bams offense.  He’s extremely limited offensively. It’s a fact."
"I'll copy and paste it below. It's written by Ann Wroe who is the greatest obituary writer I've ever seen, but it's a tradition of *The Economist* to not put the writer's name on an article.  &gt;WHENEVER HE WAS asked why his whole life had been spent playing basketball, Kobe Bryant’s narrow eyes searched upwards, and his mouth trembled. The answer was simple, yet so complicated. It began with the orange ball, the smell of it, the feel of the pebbled leather grains and the perfect grooves under his hands; and its bounce, and the way it sounded different on concrete or polished hardwood. Then came the net, the shot slithering right through it with that triumphant springing whoosh, while he howled with joy. Then every movement of the game, the strategies, the dodging and feints, the squeal of sneakers on the court. Whatever had thrilled him as a child (watching his father, also a pro player, on TV, wearing his own little 76ers outfit, running and jumping along with him) still thrilled him when in 2016 he retired from the game. “Dear Basketball”, he wrote,  From the moment  I started rolling my Dad’s tube socks  And shooting imaginary  Game-winning shots...  I knew one thing was real:  A love so deep I gave you my all.  “My all” meant training obsessively, like a maniac. He would go to the gym and shoot for hours, all day, all night. Hundreds of times, not just taking shots, but making them, running steps and patterns, practising shots off the rebound. I ran up and down every court/After every loose ball for you. He would ponder what would make his game unstoppable and then work backwards from there, building it piece by piece, move by move, repeatedly. Then, when the actual game arrived, it was all just muscle-memory. He perfected his own works of art: the jab-step-and-pause, using unexpected footwork to pass the defender, and the fadeaway, shooting while he jumped high and backwards from the basket.  For 20 seasons, a very long time to stay with one team, he played as a shooting guard for the Los Angeles Lakers. With them he won five NBA championship rings and was most valuable player in two finals. His 81 points at home against Toronto, in 2006, was the second-highest individual score recorded in league history. By the time he retired he had the third-highest points total, 33,643, overtaken only days ago by the game’s present leading star, LeBron James. His own stardom brought him in a salary of around $30m a year, allowing him to dress in Gucci and to keep house in a gated community in Newport Beach, California. It also brought sponsorship deals, such as the one with Nike, whom he asked to design shoes with heels and midsoles that could shave precious hundredths of seconds off his reaction time. For he didn’t care so much about money, points, or the fans’ applause; they could turn against him anyway, as they did after he was accused in 2003 of sexually assaulting a woman in Colorado, a case dropped but never cleared up. He cared about being the best, winning games. Simple and plain.  His obsession could make him by turns hustling, mean and dejected. When he joined the Lakers, his dream team, in 1996, traded from the Charlotte Hornets, he was only 17, the youngest player in the NBA. He had been picked for the pro leagues straight from his suburban high school and had lived as a boy in Italy, two things that made him odd. But he came in burning with self-belief. No babying for him; he was hard, focused, a lone artist, and much of that stayed. He called himself the Black Mamba later, an assassin-snake, ruthless in the strike. Unjust foul calls and lost play-off games—especially the finals against the Detroit Pistons and the Boston Celtics—threw him into misery and vows of revenge.  On the court, lithe and nimble, he wanted every game for himself. Team-mates thought him selfish, not passing enough and shooting far too much, missing more shots in his career than anyone in NBA history. He hit back at that, since at least he stayed with one team and didn’t go off somewhere else; he wanted the glory of winning the play-offs for the purple-and-golds, not just himself. Yet he so loved the ball that it just seemed drawn towards his hands. And he went on shooting, and shooting, not least because he sometimes saved a game with a fabulous floater in the final seconds. Besides, airballs too could look and feel good, good from trajectory to follow-through, on-line, on target. Some people thought Mozart had too many notes.  As in most love affairs, he had competition. One was Michael Jordan, the greatest basketball player of the era, the Buddha on top of the mountain and winner of six rings, whom he once asked for advice while he was guarding him. Another was Shaquille O’Neal, a charming giant who also played for the Lakers, but infuriated him because he little-brothered him and did not train like he did. (No one trained like he did.) To prove he was the best of basketball’slovers, he would go on playing when he was hurt, shooting left-handed when his right hand was injured, staggering on when ankles, knees and back were all sore. If he decided he was playing, no manager or coach could do anything about it. I played through the sweat and hurt/…because YOU called me.  He claimed to have no memory of the last game he played, though he scored 60 points in it from 50 shots. For a while his interests had been branching into multimedia, writing, film-making and setting up a Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks. But most of these still had basketball at the core. His longest film, “Muse”, was about his career, and an animated short based on “Dear Basketball” won an Academy Award. He gave motivating talks in America and Asia in which all his life-lessons were carried over from the court. At Thousand Oaks he coached his second daughter Gianna, among many others, in how to play his way.  With a lover’s impatience, he increasingly took helicopters to get to and from games, events, his office and the academy, in which case he might take Gianna with him. Carpe diem, seize the day, was his motto, learned at school in Italy; tempus neminem manet, time waits for no man. Bad weather would hardly deter him."
"Lebron ""Tree Trunk"" James"
Youd expect anyone but LeBron James to be hobbling after playing 87 games and having to carry a team to the finals.
"The ringer ran an article in what players create the most points for their teams via points created by points, assists and screen assists. Was a pretty good article and i will link it. Book led the suns with 43 and gobert led the jazz... not mitchell, with 39. We all knew gobert is very valuable defensively but i was surprised he was more valuable on offense.   https://www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2020/1/24/21079412/points-creation-giannis-antetokounmpo-luka-doncic-lebron-james"
"NEW ORLEANS -- Miami Heat president Pat Riley on Friday forcefully responded to criticism leveled against LeBron James by Boston Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge.  ""Danny Ainge needs to shut the f--- up and manage his own team,"" Riley said in a statement released through a Heat spokesman. ""He was the biggest whiner going when he was playing and I know that because I coached against him.""  Ainge said he was at a loss to explain why Riley should have gotten into such a lather in the first place.  ""I stand by what I said. That's all. I don't care about Pat Riley. He can say whatever he wants,"" Ainge said in the runway shortly before Friday night's game against Atlanta.  Ainge couldn't let it go without one final shot at Riley.  ""I don't want to mess up his Armani suits and all that hair goop. It would be way too expensive for me,"" he said."
"I've made numerous top level posts with golds/silvers etc. about this fact.   We all know Ben Simmons leads the league in deflections and steals. Some other facts:      Ben Simmons is one of only two players in the entire history of the NBA to guard positions 1-5 more than 10% of the time and hold every single position below their point per 100 possession averages. In today's league guarding multiple positions is more important than ever because of the popularity of switching to free up shooters/mismatches. This skill is the most valuable it's ever been and Ben Simmons is the best player in the history of the NBA at this skill (Gary Payton is the other who also did it though on lower volume).      According to backpicks.com which is the stat resource I pay for, Ben Taylor's Thinking Basketball resource: Ben Simmons is top 25 all time in overall passer rating. This accounts for a ridiculous amount of different factors and their analysis are usually spot on/trustworthy. Backpicks has him rated as the 7th best player in the league this season, now I think that's a bit generous perhaps but he's the only player in the top 10 whose box plus minus is more defense than it is offense, their formulas account for things like opponent % FG etc.      Currently, he's 3rd in points created off of assists trailing only Luka and Lebron James this season and he's 1st in 3 pt assists despite having worse 3 point% shooting teammates than Luka/Lebron. This is elite company and Ben Simmons has all time rated court vision both offensively and defensively. Offensive vision and defensive prowess are two of the most valuable weapons a player can have. At an elite level, these along with basketball IQ are the rarest skills.      Ben Simmons burst/speed is currently arguably the best in the league as Wesbtrook ages. He's fast and he's the best player in transition offense in the NBA currently. He is a one man transition unit and this adds an entire component to any offense he joins. He doesn't fit very well with slow players which is why playing with Horford and Embiid definitely can be a negative to him sometimes.      Ben Simmons is 23 years old with a case for the most versatile defensive guard ever, a top 25 all time passer, an elite transition player, he's proven elite defense that is even better against good players (see stats on him vs. Kawhi 7 game). His recent 30 point triple double is one of the most efficient triple doubles of all time on 86% FG, it only compares to efficient triple doubles by Centers like Jokic and Shaq. I haven't looked this one up so I won't state it but I would not be surprised if I looked into it and it was the most efficient 30 pt triple double of any guard not named MJ. He's a hard worker and is not injury prone with an elite motor. He's building on the kind of things you build on to go from great to all time great from age 23-27/29 and it's very likely we look back on his career to find a man who has 8 all star appearances, multiple titles, multiple all defensive NBA teams, and a case for the best defensive guard of the modern era."
Those were the trades that led to LeBron James and Anthony Davis ... is his point I believe.
"Damm, i thought it was another James Jones, some executive type guy, but it's actually the James Jones forever teammate of Lebron?"
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/raptors-computer-program-lebron-james-2013-3
"We have to retroactively take away the all star selections of Kyrie Irving, James Harden, late career Kobe, second stint Cleveland LeBron and so many more."
Shams = Klutch = Lebron = James Jones
"You found a list of some random-ass advanced stat developed by god knows who with an unknown methodology littered with random players in the top 20 and expect us all to take it as gospel just because it includes some good players on it. I have no idea what that stat measures or how it comes to those conclusions. Why would I pay any attention to it?  Here's my own list, I'm calling it HNI and here are the top players measured by defensive and offensive HNI:  1. Devin Booker, +478 HNI 2. Jevon Carter, +102 HNI 3. Luka Doncic, +98 HNI 4. Luol Deng, +95 HNI 4. LeBron James, +92 HNI  How can you look at that list and tell me Devin Booker's not an all star?? Ignore the outliers, please."
That's what LeBron James said when he was bullying Kevin Love's brain right?
Nobody  I do call LeBron James “Black Gordon Hayward” though
Probably. If we aren't counting injuried players your top team should look something like this in not particular order  1.	LeBron James 2.	Giannis Antetokounmpo 3.	James Harden 4.	Anthony Davis 5.	Kawhi Leonard 6.	Joel Embiid 7.	Luka Dončić 8.	Damian Lillard 9.	Nikola Jokic 10. ??????
"probs like 4-5 all-nba selections, he's also playing in the West, and he's the number 1 offensive option, Lowry has never been, oh yeah also an MVP.... like you know guys like Lebron James, Giannis, Harden, Steph are MVP's kinda like the best individual accomplishment a player can get and in all the other years he missed out he was probably top 3 or 5 in voting for all those years."
Lebron James
"I’m curious what determines the 3rd team all NBA spot. I mean, he’s ranked 3rd at the small forward position, behind Lebron James and Kawhi in PPG and several other stats."
Holy fuck the thought of LeBron James tackling you at full speed w/ them big ass legs is scary.  And shit I'm getting emotional seeing this guys have a good time.
"For anyone who can't find a proper list of the starters + reserves + potential snubs  **EAST**   STARTERS:  - Backcourt Kemba Walker - Backcourt Trae Young - Frontcourt Giannis Antetokounmpo* (captain) - Frontcourt Pascal Siakam - Frontcourt Joel Embiid  RESERVES:  Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Ben Simmons, Khris Middleton, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo, Domantas Sabonis  POTENTIAL SNUBS:   Bradley Beal, Fred VanVleet, Devonte Graham, Andre Drummond, Zach LaVine, Malcolm Brogdon, Spencer Dinwiddie, Nikola Vucevic  **WEST**  STARTERS:  - Backcourt Luka Doncic - Backcourt James Harden - Frontcourt LeBron James* (captain) - Frontcourt Anthony Davis - Frontcourt Kawhi Leonard  RESERVES:  Damian Lilliard, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, Brandon Ingram, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul  POTENTIAL SNUBS:   Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Karl Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Hassan Whiteside, LaMarcus Aldridge"
"You’d rather have Ingram and DLo over LeBron James and Anthony Davis? Also understand, none of us wanted to get rid of long boy."
The difference in scoring efficiency between Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell this season is the same as the difference between Lebron James and Ricky Rubio.
LeBron James
Ya people r gonna love facing lebron james in the play offs with Anthony Davis lol  Somehow with all this shitty shooting. Lakers r still first in the west. It's almost like shooting isnt the only aspect of basketball  Playing defense will naturally hurt ur scoring numbers Cuz ur using more energy on the defensive end. Lakers already shown their offense can explode
"Consistency is the mark of his greatness -- the difference between himself and most players.  For example, consider James Harden. Game-by-game, his highs are high but his lows are low. He can shoot 60% or 20% from the field. LeBron meanwhile, if you look through his game logs, is consistent. His FG% range is tighter. He can shoot 60% or he can shoot 40%.  The result is LeBron is rarely a liability offensively, ever. If he has an off shooting night, he'll be selective and won't turn in forced possessions. For most other all-stars this is not the case."
I would agree if refs had a track record of being good at officiating but they have shown themselves to be massively incompetent too many times  - Kevin Durant out of bounds no call. James Harden literally saved the refs ass in that game  - Lebron James blatent carry no call  - Denying blatant correct challenge calls by coaches  These are just a few recent notable instances.
"Because Magic played in a pass-first style and his primary function on the team was to set up his teammates or initiate the offense. Lebron and Luka also initiate the offense but their primary functions are to score. For example, Kobe was also his teams primary ball handler and, primarily during his years with Shaq, was responsible for setting up the triangle. His main role, however, was to score points and that's why he was never referred to as a PG similar to James and Luka."
"There is a reason people say ""he is the Michael Jordan of something"" and not the Lebron James.  Asides from this, NBA changed a lot. Jordan was a dominant force in the late 80s and throughout the 90s. But you can hardly compare that era of basketball with today's league.  Way more three-point shots today, defense and foulcalls have changed.  I believe Jordan would still be elite in this era, and probably work on different areas of his game that weren't that important back in the 90's (like three point shooting). The other day I had an argument with someone who told me that Harden is a better offensive SG then Jordan.  People will forget how good players were in the past. Therefore compare players within the same era."
"&gt; According to NBA.com 90% of Bjelica's production from 3 point range is from catch and shoot shots.  That's a downside. That should tell you his 3pt % is inflated and if we need him to rely on him making his own than it won't work. Davis recently went down with injury and Kuzma scored 17.2 ppg during that period. Bjelica is not the type of guy who can fill any playmaking void, he's just a spot up shooter. We have a lot of shooters on the team already.  &gt; The reason why the Lakers need a secondary playmaker and shot creation is because the normal Lebron James formula of Lebron handling the ball, driving, and dishing isn't working as well as you want it to.  I mean...its working really well actually lol, #1 team in the west. Lebron handling the ball is great its just that he can't handle the ball 48 mpg, he needs help.  AD is not going to play significant minutes at 5 during the regular season. He probably will during the playoffs at which Lebron/Kuzma can play the 4. And as great as AD at the 5 sounds on paper it has its downsides. Defensively Bjelica of course doesn't bring as much to the table as Dwight or Javale. Putting in a stretch 4 is not going to automatically make the Lakers better.  I don't know what move they can make is better, but I'd rather them keep Kuzma then go for Bjelica. We have a lot of shooters to surround Lebron and AD with. If anything Kuzma can still have trade value next year or keep developing his game and help us more in the future."
"Silence I can understand, but if you're faced with a moral dilemma and choose money over morals, especially when you already have bucket loads, I think you're a coward and frankly a bad person. LeBron James is a coward. Anyone who defends China is a coward. I'm working my ass off just to get by right now, but if the Chinese government offered me any amount of cash to sell out for them I'd tell them to fuck off. Surely these millionaires and billionaires could do the same. It pisses me off to no end.  Sorry for venting on your comment but it just bothered me. This goes beyond ""spending other people's money"" in my opinion"
Exactly . Lol  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23270138/bojan-bogdanovic-indiana-pacers-draws-raves-defense-lebron-james
"You're looking at a symptom and not the underlying cause.   The reason why the Lakers need a secondary playmaker and shot creation is because the normal Lebron James formula of Lebron handling the ball, driving, and dishing isn't working as well as you want it to.   The reason it's not working that well is because the Lakers 3pt shooting outside of KCP is inconsistent and you have traditional centers instead of a stretch 5 to space the floor.   https://stats.nba.com/players/catch-shoot/?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Bjelica  According to NBA.com 90% of Bjelica's production from 3 point range is from catch and shoot shots.   Having a consistent catch and shoot guy and more spacing due to having Anthony at the 5(a line up that they've said countless times they plan to implement during the playoffs anyway), affects other areas of the game in a positive way.  I do agree though that this shouldn't be the only move the Lakers make, they definitely need an overhaul at the guard because outside of KCP and DG everyones shot is inconsistent, the passing isn't great, and the defense is mediocre at best.   Still, what move for Kuzma are you guys gonna make that's better?"
LeBron James will probably be in the Hall of Fame
Michael &gt; LeBron &gt; Kobe  I know Kobe recently passed but you can't really think that Kobe is on LeBron James' level.
"It's immeasurable how much impact Michael Jordan, Lebron james and Kobe Bryant have made for the NBA. If you ask a NON-NBA FAN if they could name 3 basketball players, they will probably be the ones who get mentioned. There's no need to ask about status."
He’s definitely at least top 6. Better than Shaq(even though Shaq is my favorite player of all time). Better than an players who played before the 80’s. He’s one of the goats. Even LeBron James looked up to Kobe.
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo   2. LeBron James  3. Luka Doncic
"They have just as much to do with the NBA as LeBron James Jr, so...Thanks for making my point?  Man, imagine being this sad."
"\*Lebron James nervously looking at the film of the 81-point Toronto game\*  ""Look at that subtle yellow-bright coloring. The tasteful fitness of it. Oh my god... they even got scored on by Kwame Brown."""
Now what's going to happen to the bitch that called him the N word?? Or to the people showing lebron james highlights while described kobe??   Basiclly what the fuck is going to happen to all the racist ignorant bigots who are given a platform to showcase their low IQ?  Probably nothing.. oh wait I mean suspension with pay
imo lebron james is good at basketball
"Well, neither of those teams should be behind at all. The lakers also have LeBron James, Anthony Davis and 17 banners.  The warriors just had a dynasty."
"My friend messaged me on Discord saying Kobe had passed, and I thought he was kidding, so I took a headline that said ""LeBron James passes Kobe Bryant for 3rd on the all-time scoring list"" and edited it to just say ""LeBron James passes,"" and I sent it to him and said ""no man, lebron did."" Then he told me he was serious and I looked it up and then cried in the toilet."
"I think The Kobe Bryant All-Star MVP Award would at least be a little motivating.   Imagine LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, and Trae Young all playing in the all-star game.   I think those dudes would go *a little bit* harder for the Kobe Award than some no-name meaningless trophy.  Plus, it kinda fits with Kobe’s whole ethos. “Give 100% in this meaningless game. These are the best of the best? Distinguish yourself among them.”"
We're out there honoring Michael Jeffrey Jordan and LeBron Raymone James while we're coasting to the NBA finals to sweep the Bucks of Giannis Siga Ougko Antetokounmpo. Life's good.
"Harden is a loser. even if he had Lebron James/MJ next to him, he wouldn't win."
"Kyrie is think one of the few or dare I personally say only player I genuinely believe had that “mamba mentality” that’s unique in players like Kobe.  I hated to fucking see it, but who in the world decides to shoot a dagger go ahead three against the 73 win Warriors in game 7 of the NBA Finals in Oakland when you have literally LeBron Fucking James on your team? Oh; Kyrie that’s who."
"what he has is a huge set of talent and nothing else matters. what do people expect to happen, i'm sure rachel nichols will have a virtue signal monologue on her show, he'll get a fine and beyond this thread that's it.  remember when lebron bowed to china and was qing james on reddit for 3 days, season started and everyone is on his dick again. antonio brown's texts released and he's getting endorsed by the face of espn to sign with a team while sitting next to jalen rose's wife. all the nba players love chris brown and cardi b.....  this dude is signing a deal next year and no one is gonna care, just like how it's just a inside joke about hiring a fall guy."

"There are a lot of high-level athletes in that documentary, Scott Jurek for example is basically the LeBron James of Ultra Running. I'd argue the reason there's not even more is simply because only 2% of people(in the U.S. at least) are vegan. It's just not a mainstream thing because almost none of us grew up vegan."

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kareem.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into football in the last couple years. So you never watched KAJ in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""competition of his era"" or ""efficiency"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kareem’s game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest Center ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that Lebron James is better than Kareem, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kareem in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kareem is better.  You might be jealous of Kareems rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest clutch performer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Celtics fan who watched basketball in the 80s, or a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 1990’s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kareem isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like Michael Jordan The Greatest of All Time™, but leave the Kareem talk to the adults. Fair?"
"'84-'86 - Larry Bird  ('87-'89; Bird on the decline, Magic sustained his excellence, Jordan rising, it was a bit muddied here as all 3 were relatively equal)  '90-'93 / '96-'98 - Michael Jordan  '00-'03 - Shaquille O'Neal (though I suppose there is an argument between ""best player"" and ""most dominant"")  '07-'08 - Kobe Bryant (It could be argued that he was the best in previous years but that was still when Shaq was dominant and an argument could be made for Duncan as well)  '10-'18 - LeBron James (around the '09 season was when Lebron really started to make a case for best player; I'd still give the edge to Kobe at that time but it wasn't really undisputed either)."

"The room sat silent. An emotional Rob Pelinka had just finished addressing the Lakers for the first time since Kobe Bryant’s death two days earlier. His anguish was evident. Now, Frank Vogel, emceeing a luncheon designed for members of the organization to collectively grieve, had opened the floor at the team’s El Segundo headquarters to anyone who wanted to share stories their own stories about Bryant.  No one spoke. Finally, after about 15 seconds of silence, LeBron James rose from his seat. “I’ll go,” he said.  For more than 10 minutes, Lakers players, staff members and executives, including owner Jeanie Buss, sat rapt as James shared stories from his battles with Bryant as opponents and their time as teammates in a pair of Olympics. The group was gathered in an event suite overlooking the team’s practice court, directly across the gym from where the Lakers championship trophies could be seen in Buss’ office window.  When James redirected his focus to what lies ahead for the grieving franchise, James said he could handle the burden of playing through grief in pursuit of the Lakers’ 17th championship.  “God gave me wide shoulders for a reason,” James said, according to multiple people who were present.  The lunch served as the first formal team gathering since the Lakers learned of Bryant’s death while they were on a flight home from Philadelphia. The Lakers legend was on a helicopter that crashed in a hillside in Calabasas, killing all nine people aboard, including Bryant’s 13-year-old daughter Gianna.  When Pelinka, who was Bryant’s longtime agent before he joined the Lakers, addressed the room, he told stories about Bryant and “Gigi” sharing a love for basketball. They were flying to her game Sunday morning, and other victims of the crash included two teammates, three parents, and a coach.  Among those who also spoke were senior basketball adviser Kurt Rambis; assistant coaches Lionel Hollins, Phil Handy, Miles Simon and Mike Penberthy, who won a championship with Bryant as a backup point guard for the Lakers in 2001; and Dwight Howard.  Howard, who left the Lakers after one season in 2013 on bad terms with Bryant, returned as a free agent last summer, and their relationship had begun to thaw. In the fall, Bryant told the Los Angeles Times that Howard was “going to have a hell of an impact on the Lakers.” The former adversaries joked around when Bryant attended a game in November and last week, days before Bryant’s death, Howard had begun to campaign for his former teammate to assist him in next month’s dunk contest.  Tears were mixed with some laughter, sources said, as the stories about Bryant flowed and the Lakers began the seemingly monumental undertaking of moving forward.  By Tuesday, the league was grinding back into motion. It was the third day of games since the crash, and general managers were working the phones in anticipation of next week’s trade deadline. But not in Los Angeles, there has been a sense of basketball paralysis.  How could the Lakers ever get back to basketball when the whole city and a global fanbase were grieving? The NBA postponed the Lakers game against the Clippers on Tuesday, due to an understanding that the Lakers would not be ready to play in the aftermath of the tragedy.  Just days earlier, nothing felt bigger than that matchup. The city’s two teams fighting for supremacy in the Western Conference. There was pressure for the Lakers to avoid falling to 0-3 in the season series. The game mattered.  How long will it be before anything feels that important again?  Time, presumably, will help. The Lakers will not play now until Friday against Portland, giving them five days to process Bryant’s death and steel themselves for a return to the court. The team had a light shootaround-type practice on Tuesday and is scheduled for a full practice on Wednesday morning.  The Lakers will slowly get back to the business of basketball. And in time, that may start to feel like the most significant thing again. At least sometimes.  “It’s never going to feel normal,” one Lakers official said. “It won’t.”"
LeBron James (2008/09-2012/13)  Michael Jordan (1987/88-1991/92)
"Okay, so just for the record, you think John Salley is better than LeBron James? You think Robert Horry is better than Michael Jordan?"
"Think it's crazier that Kareem was about 22 when he was drafted. Kobe and Lebron already had a couple years head start, yet Kareem holds a record that's still taking Lebron James time to catch up to"
"A lot of players actually. I'm in disbelief seeing that James Harden, who I predicted to be among the top in total points scored like 3-4 years ago, is still not acknowledged in this regard. This dude is insanely durable (76 82 62/66 78 73 81 82 81 72 78 games played, no notable injuries), has a very low risk of injury type of game and has been scoring like a man possessed for the last few years.   Actually, in this pace inflated, high usage % era, a lot of superstars who are just starting their career have a good chance at ending up on top of these cumulative stats list. For example, I see many guys with a good chance of ending up over lebron or at #2 for total assists, like doncic, luka, ben and maybe morant, all guys drafted in the past few drafts.      James will get it. KD still has a chance too. Then all the younger guys are long shots, but book, doncic, trae have a good chance."

Lebron James at 40+ still ending people’s careers.
Lol no he didn't receive any votes. Rose did [source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/minnesota.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2012/5/12/3016309/nba-mvp-award-2012-voting-results-kevin-love-lebron-james-kevin-durant-chris-paul-kobe-Bryant)
"Crazier: if Memphis got the first pick, it doesn't go to Detroit. Memphis adds LeBron James to Pau Gasol."
List of people that love Cleveland.  1. Drew Carey 2. Lebron James
As a bulls fan I can say confidently I fucking hate with a burning deep boiling passion the even mention of the name Lebron James
Just like the Logo having Shaq fall in his lap...  we really don't know yet the behind the scenes senarios on how Lebron ended up a Laker. there was planning though https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/10/11/kobe-bryant-advised-jeanie-buss-to-fire-her-brother-so-lakers-would-have-better-chance-of-signing-lebron-james/
Fun fact: LeBron james was the only 2016 all-star on the Cavs. Also Kevin Love was literally a significantly negative player in that finals series. Him getting hurt for game 3 got them back in the series.
"Lebron James never lost, let alone swept in the first round.   Jordan ain’t befriending you for defending his honor, he doesn’t care about you.   If lebron was an 8 seed? Lmao please. Lebron won’t be 8 seed, just like he won’t. Lose. In. The. First. Round."
Playing at the same time as Lebron James kinda makes it hard to ever be the clear cut best player...he would have been in plenty of other time periods
"OP didn't ask who has the most gravity. OP asked the best gravity player. To qualify for that, the player just needs to have gravity. Since LeBron James has gravity as defined by the OP, he is a better gravity player than Steph. If you want to discuss most gravity, maybe another thread would be best for you.  Most gravity is still Harden. Every single quantitative output also supports that."
KD's numbers took a drop-off in playoffs in OKC. He was no different than James Harden at the tie.  Of course nobody would ever dare to put KD's name in same mention as LeBron.
"I like this timeline. Imagine Hypthetically: Bronny, drafted 2nd overall (big reach, according to analysts) by the cavs, just to have another of the James family on the team. He doesnt have a historic career, something like averages of 16-3-5. Makes it to the playoffs a time or two. Has Lebron Sr. on the sideline at games, sometimes he might even be a guest commentator, at which point he gets way too hyped about Bronny dunking on a fastbreak.   I'd want to see that future."
"[Like this?](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/in-taking-control-of-lebron-tyronn-lue-has-created-a-monster-in-cleveland/)  &gt;Blatt's use of Kevin Love, refusing to get him the ball in the post and relegating him to a stand-still shooter when all else failed, bordered on ridiculous. By letting James overwhelm him in the huddle during timeouts, Blatt unwittingly ceded control -- and demoralized the rest of the team. By not being comfortable enough to rein in James, the dynamic of the team became one of LeBron and then everybody else.  &gt;Lue changed that the moment he first told James in a huddle, ""Shut the [expletive up]. I got this,"" according to a person who heard the exchange -- and a few others like it. If Lue was going to get the stars and the role players to buy into the strategic changes he was determined to implement -- play faster, space the floor, move the ball, take full advantage of Love's versatility -- he was going to have to restore order first.  &gt;He did it in every way possible, starting with James -- calling him out in film sessions, barking at him in practice, seizing control back. Only then could the Cavaliers evolve into the juggernaut we are witnessing now.  Ok now its your turn to post your sourcing."

Lebron James is a playoff junkie

"&gt;The Warriors drafted literally all the key talent they used to win 2015. That's insanely unprecedented when it comes to winning chips as most championship teams will trade for at least one star if not more.  What exactly is your point here? The cavs luxury tax was borderline _historic_ that year. You guys have Prokhorov to thank for not being the worst in history. You weren't ""trading for at least one star"", you bought a roster. I'm pretty sure the cavs returned like... 3 players from the previous year or something along those lines.  &gt;Second, any good owner who sees the opportunity for a championship in front of their eyes would pay any amount for it.   Then why don't we see more teams doing this? Because it's simply not true.  Are you telling me Prokhorov was a good owner lol? Shit are you trying to tell me Gilberts a good owner even? The same guy who posted [this](https://thespun.com/news/dan-gilbert-lebron-james-letter-comic-sans-2010) publicly?    &gt;Winning a chip is just Cleveland things? Thank s, most of us would agree.   How can you say that with a straight face lol. The cavs have been historically inept, outside of periods where LeBron decides to show up. Are we supposed to think the cavs are some great franchise?"
"while you're right i disagree with your statement that teams dont need an elite defensive center to win. Basically the only team to win a chip in the last 10 years without an elite defensive center are lebron james led teams, and bosh did play the role of an elite defensive anchor for a while. Really 2016 cavs are the only team without one. Spurs had duncan, golden state had draymond, who you're right played the 4 a lot, but in big moments is the 5, toronto had gasol, the mavs had tyson chandler. You need an elite defensive player on the inside to win."
"BPM is the best predictor here:   &gt;BPM (Box Plus Minus) All-NBA teams:  &gt;First team: F: Giannis Antetokounmpo (12.0), F: Lebron James (8.2), C: Nikola Jokic (8.4), G: Luka Doncic (11.4), G: James Harden (9.3)  &gt;Second team: F: Anthony Davis (7.1), F: Kawhi Leonard (7.1), C: KAT (8.2), G: Damian Lillard (6.6), G: Ben Simmons (5.1)  &gt;Third team: F: Jimmy Butler (5.3), F: Bam Adebayo (5.1), C: Mitchell Robinson (5.3), G: Trae Young (5.0), G: Chris Paul (4.8)"
"I could not agree more.   That single championship is worth at least 2, maybe 3, championships to me personally (nobody has to share that opinion).  2016 was completely unique, almost a freak accident when talking about all NBA finals in history.  Lebron James was that fucking good."
Andrei Kirilenko - AK47  Paul George - PG13   LeBron James - King James  Dwyane Wade - Flash
Lebron James only going back there because he happened to be born in the Cleveland area is absolutely a fluke.
"&gt;He just tells his GM the guys he want's gone and the guys he wants to play with.   Right, and he is the one who brings those guys in. Kevin Love requesting a trade to Cleveland is the only time a star player has ever requested a trade to a small market. Anthony Davis was the prize of the league that every gm in the league as been planning to trade for for several years. Who got him?   How did Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, and Lebron James all end up free agents at the same time in 2010? What GM has gotten more top talent to play for him than Lebron? The answer is only Jerry West.  &gt;Lebron literally leaves every team he plays for completely decimated and devoid of any actual talent or assets.  So Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade are not talent? Cavs lottery picks weren't assets? That 8th pick two year ago?  &gt;Lebron literally leaves every team he plays for completely decimated  Because he carries them? He's the best player in the league too 2nd best all time."
LeBron James and the city of LA deserve credit for the Davis trade
The Cavs would be known as the worst NBA franchise ever if Lebron James wasn’t born down the road.
"shit idk bout all that bruh, Dirk had to deal with DWade in his prime, Chris Bosh, and Lebron James  basically, Lebron aint have to play himself in 2016."
"Truly. You guys are deep into a rebuild right now, but the Cavs have essentially been a non-franchise for any year that doesn't involve LeBron James. Putting the Hawks and Cavs in the same sentence is only looking at the past couple of years."
"I really like Herro, one of the best values of the last couple drafts considering where they got him. If we're lucky maybe Porter can be viewed in a similar light. Bam has clearly developed into a special player, I honestly don't think any current Cav can/will compare to him, Sexton or Garland maximizing their potential have the best chance, but I don't think they can reach his tier. Still, the last piece is the big one, we couldn't get major free agents when we had the 22 year old best player on the planet, there is no Jimmy Butler comp coming to Cleveland in 2-3 years. We'd have to get a desperate borderline playoff team to trade for Love then get Giannis/Kawhi-level lucky with a future superstar falling in the draft to the point we could get him with a protected pick. Or just win the lottery in the year of LeBron Jr and run it back with a new flock of James jerseys in Cleveland."
It is truly a miracle LeBron James won a title in Cleveland
"Kyrie, Pat Beverly, Klay Thompson, Lebron James, Chris Bosh would be my wet dream"
There's already another new LeBron James who was born in Cleveland
"&gt;and a better GM than most GMs too.  This is so ignorant. Do you honestly think Lebron James understands the complexity of the NBA salary cap? No, he doesn't. He just tells his GM the guys he want's gone and the guys he wants to play with. That does not make him a good GM. Lebron literally leaves every team he plays for completely decimated and devoid of any actual talent or assets."
I hope cavs fans enjoyed that championship cause they aint getting another til a new lebron james happens to be born in akron again
I don't even want to think about that alternate timeline where we have LeBron James for 11 seasons and win zero titles.
"I was thinking about this the other day - if you had to replace the TNT desk with active players, what combination of players would match their experience level?  - Shaq is a 4x champion, MVP, 15x All-Star  - Chuck is a MVP, 11x All-Star  - Kenny is a 2x champion  So all together the TNT desk consists of 6 rings, 2 MVPs, and 26 All-Star appearances. Every analyst has at least one MVP *or* at least two rings, and **they have never been teammates**. They have also played a career minimum of 22,213 minutes.  A combination that meets these quotas:  - LeBron James (4x MVP, 3x Champion, 16x All-Star)  - Steph Curry (2x MVP, 3x Champion, 6x All-Star)  - Russell Westbrook (MVP, 9x All-Star)  The only downside is that the TNT desk has a Forward, a Guard, and a Center. Meanwhile this combination has two guards and a GM."
"&gt;""For days and weeks leading up to James' Sunday announcement that he was indeed leaving, team sources have insisted to Cleveland.com that the Cavs would not go into full tank mode if James left, in which they essentially try to lose, clear cap space and rebuild through the draft.  &gt;""Sources re-affirmed that position on Monday, for instance holding to the organizational line that Love is not on the trading block.""  &gt;It's possible in the weaker Eastern Conference that the Cavaliers could make a run at the No. 7 or 8 seed, though a team built around Love, rookie Collin Sexton, JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, George Hill, Kyle Korver, Larry Nance Jr. and Jordan Clarkson, among others, still has a pretty low ceiling.   &gt;The Cavaliers won't be a bad team by any stretch, but teams like the Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers, Toronto Raptors, Milwaukee Bucks, Indiana Pacers and Washington Wizards all have higher ceilings.   &gt;And there will absolutely be interest around the NBA in Love, a five-time All-Star. The 29-year-old never put up monster stats during his time in Cleveland, often playing second or even third fiddle behind James and Kyrie Irving, so it's easy to forget he averaged 26.1 points, 12.5 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game in his final season with the Minnesota Timberwolves (2013-14).    https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2784198-cavaliers-rumors-cle-wont-trade-kevin-love-tank-in-lebron-james-absence"
"Giannas, Lebron, Stephen, Kevin, Kawhi, James. Despite which of the 6 you would consider to be top 5 I think the remaining player would win more than an avg of 21 games a year."
I agree with all of this except “should have been Lebron James before Lebron James.” Bit of an overstatement.
"Yea... No.   Lamar Odom didn't come into the league too early where his talents weren't utilized or anything like that. He came up in the modern nba. 6'10, great athlete, played point forward for the Lakers cuz he had a solid handle and was a good passer. Could shoot, could post. By all accounts, Odom should have been lebron James before lebron James.  He wasn't, and the only reason he wasn't was because he didn't want to be. Lamar wasn't just fine being Kobe's sidekick, he WANTED to be Kobe's sidekick. He was a passive personality, which made him a good point, but he didn't have the mindset to attack on either end of the floor.   He was a fine player, but he had no desire to be THE man. If he came into the league now I don't think it would be that much different, the man wasn't ever about being the best, he was fine with being just good enough."
"And especially A.D. man. LeBron's always been in the spotlight, but A.D. went from playing his entire career for an irrelevant losing team (no offense Pelicans fans, I think you have incredible potential with your young core) to dominating the West on the most lucrative team in the West. He's now BFFs with Lebron mothafuckin' James off the court and be a part of the most devastating duo in the league with him on the court.  On a side note, the other day I saw Anthony Davis's ""first ever chip deal"" ""signature flavor"" Lime &amp; Jalapeño Ruffles. They were delicious."
"&gt; Millions of people would do anything to be in your shoes.   No. No they wouldn't. Story time.   Basketball saved my life. I won't go into details but I was in a pretty bad place as a kid and after discovering basketball it was a kind of escape for me. 20 minutes of shooting in the morning turned into hours which turned into playing for my school and shortly after, a local club. Every day after school, I went to an outside court and played streetball for hours before my club practice. I was good. Undersized, annoying ref-arguing little brat, but damn good.  After finishing school I had a chance to play in a low level european club. This was it, the launching pad. I can't tell you how rigorous the training regime was. There I was, a person living and breathing basketball and I couldn't keep up in some shitty level european league. It was just too mentally taxing to do nothing but ball and talk about basketball *literally* all the time. That's why I have a really hard time believing just about anyone would make it NBA.  It's always a little weird to me hearing about some players not caring. Just to be in the spot they are they need to care *a lot*. I can't stress that enough. Sure, Michael Beasley might not work just as hard as LeBron James but he still has to work really fucking hard.  So no, millions of people wouldn't do anything to be in his shoes. Even if by some crazy luck of being tall and athletic and talented there would still be a ton that would collapse under pressure and go back to their normal life. 12 millions or 100 millions be damned."
"He didn't get kicked though. He got sent to Cleveland, to play with LeBron James on the team that had just gone to 3 straight finals winning 1 of them."
"Well I actually believed Kawhi would come to the Clips this offseason, so currently 1/1.  Regardless, Giannis is an alpha dog in the way he acts on the court. Look at the way he chose his All-Star team. He's not going to a team with Lebron James on it.  Honestly, I think Giannis goes 1. Bucks, 2. Dallas, 3. Toronto, 4. Miami.  A lot of that depends on how Luka progresses, how Toronto manages this offseason's contracts, and if Miami tries to swing big."
"Let's see..  Round 1.. Orlando Magic  Easy team for any top 3 seed to absolutely demolish.  Round 2..  Philly. Embiid has illness during first couple of games. And you have a lot of bigs to match up with Embiid, simmons, and tobias harris.   Multiple players on the team said they had chemistry issues Cuz they were such a new team that they didnt clearly establish who should be the ball dominant person   If Embiid wasnt sick during the beginning,  you guys prob dont even make it out of that round.   Round 3.  A Bucks team that had inflated ass wins in the reg season because cause they played in an extremely weak eastern conference with No Lebron James.   There weren't ANY scary teams in the east what's so ever except Bucks and raptors.  Celtics were trash and obv had players going into FA and wanted to jus put up good numbers for good contracts. No oladipo.   East super easy for any contender.   Bucks had good players but they stilled heavily leaned on Giannis who was mostly gaurded by 1 player. Kawhi  Let's see..  Round 4.  Raptors face a warriors team full of injuries. KD injured, Klay injured. Curry had been having severe pain on his hand. Iguodola was injured and playing through it. Even Kevon fucking Looney.  Count that. 5 injuries to major players on the team lmao..  All you had to do was double team steph. And game 6 klay was still completely shitting on the Raptors.   I dont need a bull shit little graph. Consider the context   Man you Raptors fans r gonna hold on to this championship for ever even tho any contending team wouldve beat a GSW team w. That many injuries.   Fuck you. You're the moron. Atleast I can be honest about my favorite teams flaws.  ""Her derr but I have a graph""!!  Teams sucking ass or not playing well can make your defense look better than it actually is lol  Let me reemlhasize :  IF EMBIID WASNT ILL U MOST LIKELY DONT EVEN MAKE IT OUT OF THE SECOND ROUND . THEIR BEST PLAYER DEALING WITH FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS FOR FIRST 2 GAMES AND U WIN SERIES BY 1 POINT..  It's ok man.  Call me a fucking moron.  Doubt raptors win again in my life time lmao  If they do they may need the entire starting line up on the opposing team to be injured on the bench for a chance  Suck a dick   Before u throw a graph around like it means anything, consider the match ups, and the context of the situation  Smh .  Raptors. AKA lebronto. Soon to be Giannto.  Regular season kings. Got lucky lebron went to the west. Got lucky east was so trash. Got lucky Embiid was sick. Got lucky GSW was injured.  If you deny that you are just delusional   Anyway man gl rooting for Lebronto. I mean Giannto which they will be. If the celtics dont knock them out b4 they can even face the Bucks"
"lots of ppl already think he's equal to or better than mj, and a quick way to ""win"" that argument is 3-6. more rings will legitimise his claim to GOATness. it's not that ridiculous or rare of a viewpoint (and believe you me, being lebrontoed doesn't make saying this any easier). bron's [advanced stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8qri48/mj_and_lebron_an_advanced_statistics_approach_oc/) slightly ekes out jordan's, but if you're an adherent to eye test orthodoxy there's [film analysis](https://backpicks.com/2018/04/08/backpicks-goat-2-michael-jordan/) that u can use to prop up [bron's strengths.](https://backpicks.com/2018/04/05/backpicks-goat-3-lebron-james/\))  personally i take mj cuz the mafioso gambling shit and dickhead attitude brings him over the edge 😎"
LeBron James  Avery Bradley  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  Dwight Howard
"Everybody talking about endorsements should bear in mind that the only players currently making more in endorsements than him already are [https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2019/10/23/with-long-endorsement-list-lebron-james-remains-highest-earning-nba-player/amp/](LeBron, KD and Curry). And he’s been a star for far less time than any of them.  He’s not missing much now, and according to him he’s been turning down a bunch of them."
"*Lebron James and Anthony Davis*  Basketball is a strong-link sport.   Having the best player, let alone two, is almost always worth it."
Not Lebron James
"Harden LeBron, James Paul, George Chris, Pail James"
"anthony davis, paul george, lebron james"
"This is pretty insulting to book right here. Do we forget Lou is in his thirties? In his 5th season (same age and year as book right now) he was averaging 14 pts..... Right now book is very very similar to harden at the same pt in their careers. Not notice harden has had his faults, but would we call harden not a superstar because he's not LeBron?

This dumbass fucking sub just accused me of wanting to murder LeBron James. We’re not dealing with the brightest bunch.
"Yeah you’re right, LeBron James is going to die tomorrow and the FBI will come after me.   You’re a thoughtful person and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise."
LeBron James and Anthony Davis
Yeah the only other team besides lebron James teams that gave the warriors trouble no chance/s. I also have multiple comments saying we literally have to play perfect to win. Flair up before you talk shit dude.
Clippers doing all this just to get beat by a 35 year old LeBron James in the WCF
"&gt;Can you explain the incentive for LeBron James or the Los Angeles Lakers to take part in this trade? To even send back $500?  I'm glad you finally realized my proposal was actually possible. As to why the Lakers would have wanted to make such a trade, it's because it would have been preferable to dump Luol Deng's bad contract than to stretch him (as they instead ended up having to do). Listen, since you've now realized that what I wrote back then was indeed possible, you should go re-read it because I explained it all back then. If Cleveland had followed my plan they'd have been much better off than by doing what they did."
"i do believe Lebron James wants to win basketball championships, yes"
He wasn’t better than curry lebron James harden (the real mvp) kawhi Leonard or KD
"james does not have a problem scoring on kawhi one on one. james has the handle, the speed, and the strength to get a step on kawhi and of course always has the step back to fall back on. thats why you see the clippers have STILL had to send a double when they play each other. this is why the rockets are a tougher matchup for the clippers than the lakers are. lebron does not have the speed to beat kawhi off the dribble anymore and he can't bully him because kawhi is just as strong. the rockets backcourt is going to be hell for any team now."
Take out Lebron James and the Cavs have been rebuilding for like 30 years.
LeBron James first Cavs teams
"If LeBron had opted in, yes, the Cavs (only with LeBron James permission, because LeBron had one of the NBA's only no-trade clauses in his Cavaliers contract) could have traded him for as little as a conditional 2nd round draft pick that never came to be, or a player that will never play in the NBA to which the Lakers have rights like Chinemelu Elonu. Hell, they still could have traded him to the Lakers for cold, hard cash. I'm not even sure there's a minimum - how about $500 for LeBron James.  That's a legal trade. That doesn't mean it works.   You want LeBron and the Lakers to agree to sending back an unprotected 2019 first (the one that ended landing them Anthony Davis, no less).  Also, a legal trade.  Can you explain the incentive for LeBron James or the Los Angeles Lakers to take part in this trade? To even send back $500?   LeBron James (loses money, team he's going to loses asset) nor the Los Angeles Lakers (lose asset) gain anything from it, because the Lakers had enough cap space to just sign LeBron for more money on their own."
Scapegoated so hard what a trash organization congrats on Lebron James being born 35 years ago it’s the best thing that’ll ever happen for ya
I feel like this is all regular season production mostly playing with lebron James so it has nothing to do with my argument
"Wasn't there a time the Rockets tried to get LeBron james, Paul George, Chris Paul,  and James harden all the same team?  Would have been James, Harden, Paul, George with last names.  Would have been Chris, Paul, Lebron, James with first names.  Would have been"
"God bro I’m so fucking sick of people bringing this up. Was what he said fucking dumb and hypocritical? 100%. BUT LeBron James has done more good for the world than you, I, or anyone on this sub. Get the fuck over it. He’s still a massive pro to society."
"From your description, I'd say Lebron James. With his Basketball IQ and physical prowess, he can do a LOT of things that can demoralize opponents."
"Don't give fake empathy when you can't expand on your thoughts because you have nothing of value to say.  Instead, think for yourself for a change and post when you have something of value to say!    That way when you think about insulting a figure about a civil rights issue that has given back tremendously (while going out of his way to do so) to people struggling in forms of financial support (LeBron James Family Foundation), education (a la his education initiatives in Akron, his I Promise School, full ride scholarships to U of Akron, etc), outspoken advocacy in his public life &amp; professional projects (AKA shut up &amp; dribble and The Shop)... You won't because you'll actually educate yourself to not be a moron.    There's so much wrong with people who think like you.  I don't believe these comments will influence you at all because.. well you're incapable currently.  But there's always lurkers willing to re-consider their own stances."
"""Who said what? Lebron James... the actor?"""
"I have to ask, does anyone else feel that Klutch Sports Group is a conflict of interest with Lebron James' agent being so involved."

Boomer James is my favorite LeBron lmao
"You're totally ignoring the injuries to other key role players and the effect of chemistry and time together on a team's performance.   &amp; you also totally ignored the argument of the comment you replied to. The Lakers are -5.25 with Davis and without James for the season. If they had missed only LeBron for 13 games their record would be worse. If they had missed James for 13 games and Davis for 21 games (sometimes simultaneously), their record would be even worse considering the almost total lack of competent backup ball handling and individual shot creation outside of those two."
"Comparing injuries between the two teams is a total joke. Each of Leonard and George have missed more time than Davis and James combined. Kawhi Leonard has missed 13 games, Paul George has missed 21 games (not including games he's left early), Landry Shamet has missed 17 games, Patrick Beverly has missed 15 games, and Jamychal Green has missed 10 games.  LeBron has missed 2 games, Davis has missed 7 games, Kuzma has missed 9 games, and Bradley has missed 14 games. The Lakers are trash without James so if he sat out for 13 games they'd have a far worse record."
"Kevin Garnett.   Anthony Davis.   LeBron James.  Chris Bosh.   Probably, in hindsight, Jordan. If he had swung a trade to the Knicks with Ewing... fawkin' forget about it. Detroit wouldn't have won any titles."
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2837508-giannis-antetokounmpo-net-worth-breaking-down-salary-shoe-contract-and-more  is it a new contract than this one? cause this one doesn't seem that inspiring. per this article the big dogs make more than 9 mil a year:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2779254-stephen-curry-net-worth-breaking-down-his-salary-shoe-contract-and-more   Also, nike will throw 10 mill a year at him to keep someone else from signing him. That is very much in their wheelhouse.   &gt;Considering what Harden ($200 million), Kevin Durant (an estimated $300 million) and LeBron James (possibly more than $1 billion) are making on their shoe deals, does anyone believe Curry's deal is still for only $4 million a year?"
"See Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Klay Thompson"
That's what we're hoping for tbh. Great learning experience for young dudes in what winning playoff basketball looks like first hand while being swept by LeBron fucking James
"""Opt in and trade""s only work if the player with the option is going to a team that doesn't have the cap space to sign them outright.  The Lakers had the cap space to sign LeBron James outright to a max contract.   In fact, LeBron James loses a couple million dollars right off the bat opting in, because the Lakers were able to sign him to a larger first year year contract than his option with the Cavs.   You're also incorrect that it's how the Rockets acquired Chris Paul. Paul wanted to go to the Rockets - who assured him they would be interested in maxing out his deal, which the Clippers hedged on. Houston did not have the cap space to sign Paul if he opted out, so the only way he gets to the Rockets is via that opt and trade. That forced the Rockets to send out Montrezl Harrell, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverly, and filler. If the Rockets had the cap space to sign Paul to the contract he wanted, he just would have declined his option and signed with them, rather than have his destination team gutted.  Your trade suggestion was unrealistic."
"We are talking about KB tho.  Here is another fun one from BR.  With a brutal seven-game victory over the Celtics in the bank for Bryant, the 2010 offseason is dominated by LeBron James' decision to leave Cleveland for Miami.  What matters to Bryant is Phil Jackson agreeing to return to coach the Lakers again in pursuit of a third consecutive NBA title. Bryant sends James a text message. It goes like this:  ""Go ahead and get another MVP, if you want. And find the city you want to live in. But we're going to win the championship. Don't worry about it.""  https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2172186-kobe-bryant-reveals-competitive-fire-unique-kindness-in-untold-stories.amp.html"
LMAO who the fuck said Harden's defense is **anywhere** near Giannis'??  You're just making shit up at this point because you have no logical defense for your bullshit takes.  &gt;Have fun getting kicked out in the second round again  LOL didn't you guys just become the first team **ever** to not make the playoffs with LEBRON FUCKING JAMES on your team?? ahahahahaha
"I had always thought that Dwight was enormous, but it turns out I was being fooled by how jacked he was. He's still a huge human, but by NBA standards 6'9 isn't that wild. He's Aaron Gordon, LeBron James size, and legitimately smaller than guys like Simmons and Giannis, yet I still think of him as a 7 footer. It's a hard thing to shake."

Oof....what an insecure comment. I’m sure you were alive for exactly 1 of those. You were likely a Warriors fan last year lmao  Maybe don’t miss the playoffs with LeBron James on your team 😘
"I don't think so since Eric Thomas likes to bring up the A listers in his lectures. Maybe he talked about Lebron James (he likes to talk about him) Kobe Bryant, or Steph Curry. I googled ""dead coach"" with all those names but due to unfortunate recent events I only get results about Kobe.  What I do know that before each game that player looks up to ""banners"" or something. Sorry I only recently started following this sport."
So being LeBron James basically
"“Ended up with” seems a little dismissive of how the Cavs acquired Kyrie. Griffin saw an opportunity and asked Gilbert if he would be willing to pay $28M for Baron Davis’ contract. Remember, those Cavs had set a record for consecutive losses - but Gilbert still was willing to shell out the cash. Many owners would not.   Furthermore, Koby Altman traded Kyrie, not Dan Gilbert - and Kyrie had threatened to shut it down with surgery if he didn’t (and then he shut it down on Boston). I don’t disagree that maybe the Cavs should have called Kyrie’s bluff,  but again, Altman made the trade. In the end, the Celtics got absolutely nothing for Kyrie Irving.   I blame Gilbert for mishandling Griffin, and for forcing a couple coaches onto GMs. Absolutely, and I think that was a contributing factor in Kyrie leaving - but what we’ve seen the last couple years from Kyrie certainly suggest he wanted his own team.   Gilbert’s never been the GM, drafted players, or made trades.   I’m also really not convinced the Cavs “chased LeBron away.” The only move they made that wasn’t go for broke was holding on to the pick they got for Irving. They were prepared to deal it if LeBron stayed. It’s just as likely LeBron moves his family to LA for non-NBA reasons regardless of any moves the Cavs make. It’s not like they didn’t give him a team that would support him enough to make the Finals each year in Cleveland. Last year was proof you don’t just make the playoffs, let alone the Finals, simply by having LeBron James on your roster.   And that “all in” attitude is both what makes the Cavs so shitty in the non-Bron years and in the Finals the others."
"&gt; I think you mustn’t trade anyone that you invest this much  That's a sunk cost fallacy. There are definitely times where you should trade players despite having sunk a lot into them. We saw that with the Sacramento Kings. Vivek told everyone he was trading Cousins and got Hield, and people thought he was crazy to trade away the star they had invested so much in. But the new roster for the Kings showed a lot more promise than they did with Cousins.  &gt; But AD is 3th/4th canditate for MVP/DPOY imo. Players are not cars. Trading AD would also have major complications on our team chemistry.  Would it? Where has Giannis been reported to foster chemistry issues? By all accounts, he's a super focused person who wants to win. I'm not saying that AD is an issue chemistry wise - I just dont understand where you're getting the narrative that Giannis would be a detriment in that regard.  It's also worth noting that AD is the 3rd/4th candidate for MVP partially because he's the benefactor of playing with Lebron James.   &gt; But i don’t think AD has any legit health concerns. His injuries are not serious. He is mostly a cry baby. Kobe or Larry Bird wouldn’t even subbed out for some of his injuries. Some people just have lesser pain tolerance and it’s ok.  That still is my point though - regardless of whether his pain is serious or if he's just a crybaby, he's still missing games because of it. That's not ideal."
"Detective LeBron James stars in the noir thriller ""Broken Ankles, Broken Dreams"""
"LeBron James 1 season, AD the next. Yeah we didn't get Kawhi but we can't win them all."
"Yes, that was without 3 other guys who all need the ball. One of the 3 major ball handlers has to go from this team. Lebron, Chris or James. This team needs a spot up sniper"
LeBron James and Kobe Bryant
"Its the fucking worst part of being a Laker fan for sure. A bunch of insecure children that feel entitled to every superstar and butthurt when they don't sign.   Even this clown above you ""we signed lebron james"".   Like cool bro an aging Lebron who saw an opportunity to put his kids through private schools and make money off his image is somehow a win for us.   i don't get it. Then again its easier to swallow 6 mediocre to bad seasons when you aren't 16 years old and know that sports are cyclical."
"Not all passes are to jumpshots I would say, and passing on the level of Magic Johnson, Lebron James, Pistol Pete, Stockton, etc, is methodical and transcendental,  is it not? If X player passes to Y player only in Y players best statistical chance  spots to make a shot, and does the same for player V, W, And Z, along with passing in creative and distracting ways to *further*  improve the likelihood of making their shot by backing a defender off by baiting him, or distracting him with a fake or passing so fast he can't react well, is that not making somebody hit their shots?   Any fundamental improvement in improving another players shot can be argued to the point where you are indeed making them make their shots, or do you mean to guarentee at a 100% rate to make their shots? Which I would argue is reductionist to a fault."
It’s 2020 and LeBron James still just fucks around  and coasts until he feels the need to prove he’s the best again. king shit.
LeBron James hairline is as bad as my bank account.
Lebron James is not fucking fair
There are few humans that have existed that are more athletic than lebron james. No nba player ever is more athletic than him. He’s a fucking freak
Giannis bro this is a perfect time to use that post fadeaway you've been practicing   Because you're not gonna bulldoze Lebron James man
"Weird thing is Lakers are putting LeBron ""no defense"" James on Giannis for some reason"
"Lebron ""Lonzo Ball"" James and Anthony ""Zion Williamson"" Davis"

"michael jordan and lebron james combined have 1 total finals appearance before the age of 25, which as it happens, is the age of giannis."
I fucking love Lebron James. When he sees an advantage in size he almost always goes to the post. I wish a pussy like AD would do that to his defenders. Most of the time he will face up and do some bullshit that ends in a fadeaway in the paint.
LeBron James is the best player in the NBA

"lol you know nothing about chuck if you thought he's born with it.  LeBron James and? Michael Jordan were born with it.  Guys like Kobe, Chuck,  Dennis Rodman worked for it.

"2016 at 5:10, a wild LeBron James appeared"
"To be fair, I don’t think he was 100% when he came back from his injury. Dude in the article said it should have been a 6 month injury. Not sure how reliable this is though.   Link: https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/physical-therapist-shares-extent-of-lebron-james-groin-injury/ar-BBV8Yiz"
"It doesn't, it's just a product of the fact they have a reliable ball-handler in LeBron James.  The reason they don't have another reliable ball-handler is because they constructed the team around the fact that LeBron will play 43 minutes a night in the playoffs and that it won't matter the fact they don't have a 2nd guy to fill in for him.  That makes the supporting cast look bad when he is playing 36 minutes in the regular season because it doesn't fit, but when you look at it in isolation this team is actually loaded and in the playoffs that problem will be severely diminished.  Green, KCP, Bradley and Caruso are all very solid 3 and D guys and Kuzma is a nice wildcard to have in playoff series when there is a random game where he will drop 30."
"You curiously have yet to explain how an alleged MVP player's team totally sucks in the absence of LeBron but not the other way around. Sorry, your boy Davis isn't an MVP player and it's obvious to anyone with common sense. The Lakers are elite with James on and Davis off. They're straight up awful in the reverse situation.   &gt;  elite role players and an all star dogshit  ""All Star"" Kevin Love averaged 14.9 PPG on 39.2% from the field and 34.0% from three along with shit-tier defense. ""All Star"" Kevin Love recorded single-digit points in 5/22 playoff games that season, not including his zero point performance in which he left 5 minutes in. ""All Star"" Kevin Love posted a TS% below 50 in 8/22 playoff games. By all metrics he was trash in that run.   Here's how Cleveland's ""elite"" role players performed during the 2018 playoffs:   \- JR Smith: 8.7 PPG, 48.6% TS  \- George Hill: 9.2 PPG, 56.7% TS (31.4% from three)  \- Jeff Green: 7.7 PPG, 52.4% TS (30.0% from three)  \- Kyle Korver: 9.1% (not a typo) percent from three in the Finals, garbage defense throughout the playoffs  That team won 50 games and made the Finals on the strength of their offense, which was led by LeBron James. They were a horrific defensive team so it's not like their role players contributed much on that end. That team was trash. LeBron put up 51/8/8 on 59% shooting in Game 1 of the Finals and the Cavaliers still lost because the garbage cans he was surrounded with shot 37% from the field and 23% from three.   Please stop embarrassing yourself. Keep downvoting, maybe that will help Davis lead the team to just mediocrity instead of garbage."
"1. The Lakers were plagued with injuries to not only LeBron James, but also Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram.  2. The Lakers were 28-27 with LeBron playing and 9-18 without him. So he obviously made them much, much better. They were a +2.3 with LeBron on the court and -5.8 without him.   3. Davis missed the playoffs in 5/7 seasons to start his career. Even when the Pelicans made the playoffs they weren't a threat to do shit. LeBron's 2018 carry of that dogshit Cavaliers roster to the Finals is much more impressive than anything Davis has done in his entire career combined.   4. The Lakers are totally inept when LeBron sits. An MVP player should be able to maintain his team above suckage levels when the other star player sits. Davis can't do that because he's not an MVP player."
Agains a team lead by Lebron James and matthew dellavedova. What a champ lmao he even won finals mvp that year cause he played so good right? You guys are delusional
" LOS ANGELES - All week as the Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers prepared for their showdown Friday night at Staples Center, there were two predominant conversations swirling around the game.  Naturally, in a matchup of the best teams in each conference — and the league as a whole — there's the notion that this could be an NBA Finals preview.  Additionally, there's a consensus that this game will feature the 2019-20 league MVP, though the question is whether it will be Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo for the second successive year, or if Los Angeles' LeBron James will take home his fifth regular-season MVP and first since 2012-13.  For much of the season, Antetokounmpo has been considered the clear favorite to repeat, but over the past week, James' on-court exploits have generated some debate, most of it centered on the argument that James should be in the conversation with Antetokounmpo for the top spot.  So, is it truly a two-man race?  The Journal Sentinel conducted a straw poll of 35 media members outside of Milwaukee who served in the NBA's 100-person media panel that voted for league awards last year. These individuals, who are likely to have a vote again this year, were asked to rank their top three MVP choices based on the season to date. Their votes can change between now and the end of the season when the league will mandate voters to choose a top five, but for now, the results at the top are clear.  **It's Antetokounmpo in a landslide.**  **Of the 35 voters who responded to the poll, 33 indicated Antetokounmpo is their MVP choice at this moment. One person placed Antetokounmpo second and one other split their vote between Antetokounmpo and James, saying the two players are deadlocked.**  James appeared on all 35 ballots as well, earning one outright first-place vote, 30 second-place voter and three third-place votes in addition to the split first-place vote.  The full results of the poll are below:  **Antetokounmpo:** 33.5 first-place votes, 1.5 second-place votes, 0 third-place votes  **James:** 1.5 first-place votes, 30.5 second-place votes, 3 third-place votes  **James Harden:** 0 first-place votes, 3 second-place votes, 15 third-place votes  **Luka Doncic:** 0 first-place votes, 0 second-place votes, 9 third-place votes  **Kawhi Leonard:** 0 first-place votes, 0 second-place votes, 3 third-place votes  **Nikola Jokic:** 0 first-place votes, 0 second-place votes, 2 third-place votes  **Undecided:** 0 first-place votes, 0 second-place votes, 3 third-place votes  Antetokounmpo's MVP case is about as strong as they come. Not only is he the best player on the best team — a Bucks squad currently on pace for 70 wins — but Antetokounmpo has been historically dominant this season.  He's averaging 29.6 points, 13.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists while playing just 30.8 minutes per game — the 66th-most minutes per game in the league. His efficiency has put him in rare air, with his player efficiency rating (31.77) second only to Wilt Chamberlain's 1962-63 season (31.82).  Antetokounmpo has played 261 minutes fewer than James but has exceeded his average outputs in most categories, including scoring, rebounds and blocked shots while also shooting better from the field (54.8%), even in terms of effective field-goal percentage, a stat that rewards better three-point shooters.  James is averaging 25.4 points and 7.8 rebounds in 34.9 minutes per game while shooting 49.7%. The feather in James' cap is that he's leading the league with 10.7 assists and overall assist percentage (49.8%), a remarkable first for the 17-year veteran superstar.  There's certainly room to debate which player at their peak would be the best defender for a single possession, game or playoff series, but in the regular season, Antetokounmpo has unquestionably been one of the best defenders.  He wreaks havoc for the league's best defense, holding opponents to the lowest field-goal percentage (36.1%) among players who have played enough games to qualify for the NBA's official leaderboards. Antetokounmpo also ranks first in the league in individual defensive rating, defensive win shares and defensive box plus-minus, putting him in clear contention for defensive player of the year, though he may have to fight teammate Brook Lopez for the award.  While the offensive and defensive numbers all favor Antetokounmpo, that shouldn't diminish the fact James is again dominating the league at an age (35) when most players are on the decline. None of that is lost on Antetokounmpo.  “It’s amazing,"" Antetokounmpo said Wednesday. ""Obviously, how old is he, 35? Thirty-five and playing at a high level, helping his team win, he just leads the path for us.  ""A lot of times we think that, ‘OK, we’re going to retire at 35,’ but seeing a guy at 35 being still a top-three player in the world, that makes us want to be them, like, makes me want to be there one day. Got to keep taking care of my body, eating the right way, being healthy and, as I said, he paved the way and hopefully we can just follow.”  Friday's game likely won't change the MVP conversation. Based on early returns, it's looking like Antetokounmpo has a firm grasp on the award barring any unforeseen circumstances.  As much as that conversation may continue, though, there are two people who profess not to be interested in it at all — Antetokounmpo and James.  “It’s never motivated me,"" James told reporters Thursday. ""Regular-season MVP has never motivated me. To be the best, to be the best to ever play the game has motivated me and it’s resulted in me being able to be league MVP a couple times.”  On Monday, Antetokounmpo said something similar, but more succinct.  ""It's not important at all,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I really don't (care)."""
"Christ this is annoying. Counting stats:  Anthony Davis stats: 26.6+9.5+3.2+1.5+2.5 = 43.3  Lebron James stats: 25.4+7.8+10.7+1.2+0.5 = **45.6**  Lebron leads in RPM, PIPM, +-, games played, even defensive rating.  &gt;and defensive win shares.  https://stats.nba.com/players/defense/?sort=DEF_WS&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612747"
"Only someone who strictly looks at PPG would think Davis is an MVP-level offensive player.    Without James, the Lakers score 109.6 points per-100 possessions, which would rank in the bottom half of the league. MVP-level offensive players should be able to lead teams to way better offenses than that. When Davis sits and it's just LeBron out there, the Lakers' offensive rating is 118.8 which is almost 3 points better than the Mavericks (who currently have the greatest regular season offense in NBA history).   The vast majority of Davis' buckets are assisted so even his 27+ PPG aren't indicative of how good of a scorer he really is. He's not a great isolation scorer and not an elite passer. How is he an elite offensive player?"
"Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!” Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Lebron James is my favorite player, but Barkley is absolutely correct. Giannis has it locked for me right now. If Lebron was averaging 30, without taking more shots (basically I’m asking for him to bring up his efficiency), I would consider him a little more. His passing is better, his scoring is worse (slightly). Giannis was a (deserved) MVP last season and he’s just as good this season. Give it to him. That being said, hopefully AD and Lebron win it all!"
Anthony Davis stats: 26.6+9.5+3.2+1.5+2.5 = 43.3  Lebron James stats: 25.4+7.8+10.7+1.2+0.5 = **45.6**
“But  I think what a lot of people are misunderstanding about how great Giannis is ..is how they put that team together..they put that team together around him that fits his attributes perfectly “ -lebron James   So we’re misunderstanding how great Giannis is ... cause how well they [the bucks] built the team around him ...  Coming from the dude whose career was literally built surrounded by 3 point shooters that fit his driving and kicking attributes perfectly
"Ad leads Lebron by very small margins in the stats he leads while Lebron is far ahead in the stats he leads. You can see the difference when you add the stats up.   Anthony Davis stats: 26.6+9.5+3.2+1.5+2.5 = 43.3  Lebron James stats: 25.4+7.8+10.7+1.2+0.5 = **45.6**  Then consider all the games Ad has missed, the Lakers great record with Lebron and without Ad, the on/off stats, the eye test. It's very obvious that Lebron is the MVP."
"LeBron James doesn’t have a case for MVP, end of discussion."
Who actually deserves MVP:  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  huge gap  2. LeBron James  huge gap  3. James Harden 4. Nikola Jokic 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Luka Doncic 7. Anthony Davis 8. Jimmy Butler 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Kemba Walker
"That is probably Chuck's biggest accomplishment in NBA, at least accolade wise. A lot of buyers would think something like ""well it's a nice trophy but it's not Michael Jordan or Lebron James'"".   It is much more valuable to him than any logical buyer out there."

He's lucky he's one of the GOATs because he'd get roasted for shit like this even harder lol. It's hilarious thinking about the machine LeBron James picking out pleasantly scented emojis to offset his barrage of poop emojis. How long you think it took him to take that forlorn picture in front of his mirror after they lost the other night? I don't know why this kills me so badly but it does.
"There is an idea of a LeBron James, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there."

"When is the last time he was like intentionally cool.   I mean I understand him being cool because he's LeBron James and what he does on the basketball court is dope as fuck.

"I think people are missing your point. This is a good strategy because   - PJ has never been a high volume guy and isn’t gonna be comfortable jacking a ton of shots even if open, we’ve seen this happen with guys like Myles Turner. It’s a tough spot for him because he’ll feel like he’s taking shots away from Houston’s best players, he’s not a no conscience shooter like Tyler Herro or JJ Redick, guys like that   - If Westbrook and Harden drive their shots are more heavily contested   - Making the pass to the open shooter is always gonna be the right play, but it they’re not making shots it doesn’t feel that way and puts pressure on Harden on Westbrook, both in the way they judge their own performance (#s) and the way hot take media is gonna be talking about them. See James Harden last year vs the warriors (https://youtu.be/Y21CX8zrCgA) or Lebron in the 2011 finals"

Even in college most people didn't think he was even make it to the NBA - he certainly had the athleticism and overall ability (his IQ and anticipation of outstanding).. but it just did not seem like he was going to be at that level outside of maybe some G-league time.  Now look at him.  He's significantly contributing on one of the most storied franchises in NBA history on a championship contending team alongside LEBRON JAMES.  He gets to throw alley-oops to Lebron, Anthony Davis, and Dwight Howard..  or throw down sick dunks himself and run over and chest bump Lebron.  I am so happy for him and I am sure he never imagined something like this would happen."

"Lebron is/was a unique combination of dominant physical talent and basketball IQ. It's really hard to be the next Lebron if you can't blow past anyone or physically dominate other teams. So Luka is the better prospect, but he's more likely to be the next Larry Bird or James Harden, whereas Zion would have a better chance to be the next Lebron."
You just said what most people say about LeBron James around the world.
"LeBron: Lower end All-Star, can still turn it up from time to time. Could have a season like CP3 this year  Steph: Elite roleplayer/floorspacer, just a bit too bad on Defense by now  Kawhi: IF he stays healthy and somewhat durable he'll still be All-NBA  James Harden: Call me crazy but I think he'll still be Superstar or really close to that level. I feel Harden has a great old man game.  Kevin Durant: Tough decision, he'll either be out of the league or be still a really solid offensive player. KD will be 37 I think so I don't know if he'd still be able to get you that much value on defense but if he stays healthy and recovers solidly from his achilles injury he should always be a super useful offensive player."

"Honestly good deal. Even if waiters isn’t special the Lakers need as much scoring and ball handling as they can. I don’t think Waiters plays much but he might work his way and be a decent 10ppg guy off the bench. With AD and Bron they have the scoring options. If Kuzma, Morris, Waiters, and even KCP give balanced scoring  efforts, I think this team can come out of the west.     Waiters history is an issue but I think people have to get about taking risks. Waiters might really accept his faith now and honestly it doesn’t seem guy has been that bad of a distraction out side a few small problems. I mean do people remember how Michael Beasley came back for a bit with the Knicks and Lakers. It might be imposssinle but Lakers made Howard focus so I don’t blame them for taking on Waiters. It’s up to Witwrs and Lakers to work it out. Also the fact James is okay with Waiters on his team shows Lebron and Waiters are willing to play with each other."
"Isn't the biggest concern you need someone besides Rondo to play backup ball handler when James sits?? I thought that was implied, everyone knows LeBron is on the Lakers don't worry"

"Unless we’re talking Girl Scout cookies, Al Pacino movies or Stevie Wonder albums, everything has a saturation limit, or at least it should.  Is scoring in the NBA reaching that point?  For a league that was desperate to see scoring reach the 100s when games were slow marches to 90, the rules were opened up to increase scoring, limit overly physical play and display the athletes at their best.  That has had the desired effect — almost too well.  Every team is averaging well over 100 points per game (league average 111.4), with the Charlotte Hornets bringing up the rear at a measly 102 per night — the same production as the Miami Heat back in 2010-11.  Yes, that’s the first year of the LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh partnership.  The game we’re watching nightly is so drastically different from the contests we saw even five years ago.  Remember that Stephen Curry bomb on Feb. 27, 2016, against the Oklahoma City Thunder in one of the greatest regular-season games of the decade? The 40-ish footer from barely a step inside of half-court that caught everyone off-guard, especially Anthony Roberson?  Well, LeBron James has hit shots from that zip code twice in the last week. The first was the “not yet, kid” triple Sunday that quieted the frenzied New Orleans crowd after Zion Williamson brought the house down with a dynamite dunk on a nationally televised game.  The second was a calm, walk-up triple Tuesday from the Los Angeles Lakers logo a couple nights ago.  The skill levels of the incumbent players as well as the young stars entering the league have been aided by the rules being so loose.  According to basketball-reference.com creator Justin Kubatko, February was the second month in league history in which six players — Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum and Damian Lillard — averaged 30 points or more.  The first month that occurred?  January 2020, with Kawhi Leonard and Devin Booker joining Lillard, Westbrook, Young and Beal.  Notice the names that haven’t been mentioned? Luminaries like James, Curry, Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Curry has been out most of the year, but he could wind up on that list next year, and with Durant recovering from an Achilles injury, he could return to elite status next season.  For all we know, we could be in the most golden of golden eras of scoring, with talent like Zion Williamson and Luka Doncic ready to do more damage as time goes on.  But if these explosions are so commonplace, does it diminish how special it feels, especially with defenses not having much of a chance to earn the benefit of the doubt?  Whether it’s the “gather and two steps” rule or no more hand-checking or mere evolution, it feels like we’re in a juiced-ball era that would make the slow-down coaches of the ’90s cringe.  This isn’t opining to go back there, not by a long shot.  But maybe, just maybe, we can play some games on All-Madden once in a while?  OK, old man no longer yelling at cloud.

Lebron James only cries if it makes him money. Never forgetting the Hong Kong issue

Morey is a legit fraud. He backed down immediately and LeBron never was pro China that's you making it a purity test. If he didn't go against China 100% then he is 100% for them. What James harden did was worst but people don't care and that's all I need to know to realize how fake the outrage is
"Lebron wasn't the mvp in 2018 precisely because they were the 4th seed in a significantly weaker conference and division. However harden led the Houston rockets to 65 wins and the best record in the NBA. Not just the western conference the entire NBA. The Cavs were the 6th best team in the league that year in the regular season. Despite his playoff run which is greatly overrated beating an injured celtics team and walking past the raptors who's best players game resembled that of a mediocre allstar at best. What did he really accomplish that season? Think about it Houston faired far better then the cavs in the western conference finals and not a single person thought the finals matchup vs the cavs would be in their favor... every single nba analyst had the team winning the championship whoever made it out of western conference. Not to mention harden leading the nba in scoring whilst averaging almost 9 assists per game and about 2 steals and defence cant even be argued because lebron was equally as dreadful on the defensive end in 2018. This idea that lebron is the best player that's ever graced us with his presence needs to stop he hasn't been the best player in basketball for years now. He doesn't play defence he's robotic with his offence and the teams whole identity relies on his being on the court because the entire team is built to benefit his own game. Let's not even take into account the teams and players hes played with for christ sake. He should have at most 5 championships 3 with the heat and probably 2 with the Cavs however time and time again we've found out that the ""Lebron way"" just doesn't cut it. Team oriented basketball with great defence wins and it's clear lebron isn't capable of either. It's the same reason harden hasn't won. However 2018 was James harden's MVP."
"I posted this elsewhere in the thread but figured I'd make a comment on the actual post to remind everyone why many people despise Lebron and his fake woke persona.   he knowingly profits off the slavery of children while pretending to be holier-than-thou where he hosts other douche celebrities to join him in a barber shop set to speak about ""social justice"" as, again, he makes billions of dollars off of slave labor.  Then calls people incredibly obviously more educated and intelligent than himself ""uneducated"" when they speak up about actualy humans rights violations because they're costing him money from China, his owners.  Finally he has an army of redditors like your self who pretend that anyone who criticizes these decisions or his motivations are simply ""haters"" because he's so great. Oh and he gave some of those billions he made off the 3rd world children to american kids so they could go to a nicer charter school than the ones they were attending before.  None of this would even bother me though if LeBron wasn't constantly pretending to be a Saint and a Philosopher every other week while also saying some of the dumbest shit I've ever heard come out of a human being's mouth.  ""Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others and you're only thinking about yourself,"" James told reporters in Los Angeles.  ""I don't want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl, with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke,"" James said. He added, ""And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually.""  Literally some of the dumbest shit I've ever heard in my entire life. And he calls others uneducated. Lol.  Please don't downvote me too hard everyone, I would hate to get in a word or sentence feud with any of you."

&gt; Well KD literally has.   His team won without him won   - 67 Games  - the 2015 NBA championship  - 3rd longest win streak ever   - Broke the all time wins record  - Made back to back finals  - Made a third finals in 2019 despite having nobody in the barnes/kd role and no bench and a banged up klay thompson who ended up missing 1 and a half finals games     All without durant. Durant proved literally nothing besides he could win a title on a team that won a  title and made 3 finals without him. KD consistently had james harden like drop offs in the playoffs efficiency wise before he joined a 73 win team where he got less defensive attention than any star in the history of the NBA.    So impressive.... also watch the 2017 finals. He had the easiest shots and more space than any other superstar in the history of the NBA finals. People remember that one shot over lebron when he was front running on the warriors and they forget all the wide open layups and wide open shots he was getting. ignoring how he was going 1 on 1 with all the space in the world against the cavs bigs because curry and thompson pushed the defense towards them.   Durant literally hasn't proven anything since he left OKC. How are people like you so stupid to realize he joined a team that was the best team in the NBA with or without him.

"LeBron,Giannis,Steph,Kawhi,Kd,James harden,Luka,Joel,Jokic, then there’s like 5-7 guys including ad for the last spot, this was in no order btw."
I dont get it. Lebron James makes you better.
"“Giannis, who is your top 3?”  Giannis: at the end of the day it’s Lebron, Kawhi, and...me. Honestly.   “What about James Harden?”  Giannis: at the end of the day, top-3.   “....ok...”"

"I feel like draynond is that guy who rryes to do a bit of everything on the court, but minus the the super athletism/raw skill required to.    Like lets say drummond. He knows his job and will put all his will to accomplishing it.   Not like randomly here and there hes gonna decide hes now lebron james bringong the ball up and then try to iso some guy for a stepback brick.   Thatz egat I see everytime I see the man play. Like bro you aint gonna iso anyone or break any ankles. Dont even recall anyhing past a crossover being  in his bag.... not even a between the legs.  So the guy cant dribble. Cant create his shot. Cant shoot. Takes very questionable decisions all the time.  The guy was playing with a whole g league squad and instead of taking hia free dunk he fckin hoops it off the board to the 15th string Gleague reservist.   Fckkkk. Atleast when hes says hell with it and theows rhe game he dies it in style"

"The Process sounds nice if you just say ""The Process"". LeBron ""The King"" James sounds trash too"
LeBron James
There is no concrete right or wrong dude this is a hypothetical about a 20 year old Magic Johnson playing with 20 year old LeBron James in 2020. This is for discussion of the hypothetical jeez are you this 🤡 no wonder you don’t discuss
"He led the Celtics to 55 wins and the 2 seed.   Dame has been to the conference finals 1 time and got swept.   Embiid has never made it past conference semi’s.  Chris Paul wasn’t able to get past the conference semi’s until he was traded to a team where he was the clear number 2 option beyond the guy that literally won the mvp.   Anthony Davis could barely even make it to the playoffs, let alone go on a deep playoff run.   James Harden has brought his team to the conference finals as the best player one time. I love James Harden so it hurts putting him in here but he definitely fits.  Of all the players I listed, only two have made it further than Kyrie did with last the 2017-2018 Celtics and each one only did it a single time.   How exactly is there a difference?   Lebron, Steph, KD, Kawhi, Harden, Giannis. Those are really the only players that I think most would agree meet the standard of “best player on championship team” that Kyrie somehow gets held to."
"&gt; the fact that you believe a higher school kid runs faster than most modern NFL players  It's not a random high school kid. It's LeBron James, one of the freakiest athletic freaks in history. That was clowning on NBA players while in high school."
"Ok and how many players like that are there in the league? Maybe 6?   Based on this opinion which I constantly see on this sub, none of the following are good enough to take a team to championship contender status as the best player on their team:  - Chris Paul (prime) - Dame Lillard - Anthony Davis - James Harden - Joel Embiid   None of those guys have ever reached the finals before outside of Harden as a 6th man. In fact for most of their careers they havnt even come close. Yet if I were to say that any of them arent good enough to take a team to championship contender status as the best player on the team then I’d probably get a lot of hate.   There are literally 4 current NBA players who have taken their team to the finals as the best player on the team...  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curray 3. Kevin Durant 4. Kawhi Leonard   How come Kyrie is the one that constantly gets the whole “he’s good but not good enough to be the number 1 option” criticism."
"As COVID19 is currently running rampant all over the world, and the CDC publicaly stating to not hoard masks, we have Instagram pages benefiting from using the NBA and its players, notably Lebron James, to sell overpriced masks for which hospitals and health care workers are currently running out of.  Please help in reporting, and making sure masks end up to our healthcare workers that desperately need these to fight off the virus."

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

LeBron James was a man amongst boys.   Look at the way he rebounded the ball at 13:08.   A true generational athlete. Some NBA players in their primes aren't even near LeBron's athleticism and strength when he was 18.
Lebron james
Celtics signed Kemba while Lakers signed Anthony Davis and LeBron James.
"I am Op lol, he was a polished scorer but early in the decade he was put with the likes of LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, and Chris Paul. Layer in the decade he was thought of someone who could produce in Houston and OKC. He never should’ve been cut from the nba though."
"Growing up in Ohio as he was doing his thing in high school Lebron James to the Cavs was a pretty easy jumping in point , however in 2002 I had moved to Florida, so I was a long distance Cavs fan starting at age 5.  Then, when Lebron came to Miami it got weird because I’d never actually been to Cleveland, lived quite far from it, and didn’t support any of their other teams. I certainly wasn’t going to follow to Miami Lebron bandwagon and I found myself rooting for Dwight Howard and the Magic after seeing one of their games live.  It wasn’t a passionate fandom though and I eventually found myself being more of a fan of players. This culminated in me rooting for Lebron once more against the Warriors during the first two years.  However, afterwards, going to college an hour south of Portland I fell in love with the Blazers and Dame.  Edit: I had already also had a strong love for Portland because of Greg Oden, and Philly due to Evan Turner, and subsequently those are my two teams now.  Also, I think 2k helped."
Lebron James Harden
"That’s what people don’t understand. Let’s say his 4.3 40 yard was a little off because they used stop watches back then, ok so he can a 4.5-4.6 instead, that’s Lebron James type of speed as a 7 footer. Let’s say his bench of 500 is exaggerated(even though people say they witnessed it), and let’s say he only benched 400, that’s still as strong as prime Shaq. Let’s say the vert was a little off and he only had something between a 40-45 inch vert, that’s Lebron James level hops on top of being that tall lol. If you combine that with wearing stuff other than converse and having a good diet/coaches. It’s criminal to think he’d average anything less than 30-15-4."
Wait is Sierra canyon an elite prep school for ball?  I only heard of that school once lebron james jr went there (although I know there are other nba families’ kids there before him) and I didn’t think it’s on the level of Montverde or even Campbell hall
"Interesting concept however I think votes would be completely different if people weren't allowed to win again.  For example do we think the people that voted for all the people other than Tony Parker would've voted for Tony or for someone else?  If we look at this year, Luka would probably be winning it this year(being the highest ranked without an MVP), but if we know Giannis, James Harden, Russ, Kawhi, Lebron, etc. aren't eligible would people be voting for Luka over AD?"

Jeremy Lin was absolutely killing it in NY until he faced LeBron James and the Miami Heat. I don't remember a time where a player got attacked so hard on the defensive end but the Heat were ruthless. Jeremy Lin finished with 8 turnovers and shot 1-11 from the field.

I'm imagining LeBron James just banging his head every time 'cause the room's too small. Goes up for a lob and breaks a chandelier or some shit.

"I know I scoff when people see montages of NFL players dunking and say they could play in the NBA, but I'm convinced Miami-era LeBron James would have been a pretty good WR/TE at least.    There's just not a lot of guys with that amount of size, athleticism, body control, and sports IQ, before even bringing up his football experience. I just don't see how route-running and making contested catches would be harder than what he's had to be responsible for on an NBA court."

And Lebron James looks like an overgrown leprechaun
"no, he was meant to be a stretch 4 who didn't need the ball in his hands since lebron and kyrie did. he was the guy who'd benefit from lebron and kyrie's gravity  people mostly don't know because they don't care, but love was tied with james harden at nearly 7 3PA per game the year before he joined cleveland. that was 4th in the whole NBA in 3s per game  he was already what he became in cleveland but he had a bad back that year and he never got over it. he was never very athletic and was even worse because of his back. he lost weight but he started losing weight in minnesota to facilitate his perimeter game. he was just never a great interior scorer even in minnesota, wasn't even top 50 in post up efficiency most years"

Can only imagine what a player would have to do to even begin to display that level of loyalty to the team brand. James Harden would have to hitch a ride with NASA. Lebron would have to literally drink lake water before every game for strength. Chris Paul would have to refuse to play unless it was a thunderstorm outside.
"Lebron James went to the same high school as me. In fact, he sat next to me all semester in intro to rocket science. No assigned seats btw. We were taking the final and i caught him looking at my test. I didnt really mind, so i didnt say anything. One week later while waiting for my final grade, i get a letter from the dean requesting my presence. In the meeting the dean lets me know that an anonymous student filed a report against me saying that i bullied him into sitting next to me all semester so i could cheat off him. Since other students corroborated the story, i was to be promptly expelled. It left a permanent mark on my record, so i couldn't transfer anywhere else in the state. Out of state tuition was even higher, so there was no way i could afford school elsewhere. My parents disowned me, not even my dog would look at me.  Two years later, im homeless and living on the streets in front of the Javits Center in NYC, begging for change. I had one of those tin cans next to me, since i was too ashamed and depressed to look people in the eye and ask for money. The can basically spoke for me. Suddenly, i hear the noise of something going into my can. I grabbed it and looked inside, and found a single ticket to Comic Con. I look up and i see none other than Lebron James. As he continues on his way, he turns around and flashes me a quick wink and smile.  When i tried to use the ticket, the attendant let me know it was counterfeit and the cops arrested me on the spot."

"Lmao Tacko Fall did not show *any* promise whatsoever in college. He went undrafted because he's a terrible basketball player, and only got signed because of his height.   He put up incredibly mediocre stats in college despite playing for one of the weakest conferences in the first division of the NCAA, while also being physically superior to every player he ever played against on a regular basis.   He was atrocious, and still ended up on an NBA team because this league is all about storylines. And getting a genetic freak on your team gets people interested. So there is literally no doubt in anyone's mind that Lebron James Jr. is going to end up on an NBA team regardless of how good or bad of a basketball player he is."

"&gt; although they were still the 1 seed in the east.  And the Cavs were the 2 seed (because of their defense, which was carried by Lebron's team and not him).  &gt; They had a top 7 offense and defense  The Cavs had an even better defense, and were only one spot behind the Pistons in Net Rating (Detroit was 6th overall, the Cavs were 7th). This was not a bad supporting cast.   &gt; You keep sugarcoating your own stats and skimming over important details to frame your argument how you want it to look, instead of at least trying to remove your own biases and paint a complete picture of reality  Lmao stop projecting. Your entire previous comment was filled with innaccuracies, mistakenly applied stats, and flat out lies.   &gt; You cannot in one hand claim that Lebron played in a weaker conference, while in the other hand claim his teammates were far more efficient to Jordans  This makes zero sense. I didn't say Lebron's teammates were more efficient, I said they were better overall (because they were a nasty defensive team). And second, those things aren't mutually exclusive in any way. Lebron having weaker conference opponents has nothing to do with the quality of his teammates.   &gt; You know for a fact that Jordan didn't have to face any dynasties in his prime years because the Celtics and Lakers had already fallen apart  This is wrong on so many levels. The Lakers hadn't fallen apart yet when Jordan faced them in the '91 finals. They were on their 4th finals appearance in 5 years (having won 2 rings in that span). They were a 58 win team that season, and 3rd overall in Net Rating.   He also faced the Pistons dynasty in his prime (they went to 3 straight finals and won 2 straight rings. They would have gone to a 4th straight finals, with a chance of a threepeat, if Jordan didn't beat them in the '91 ECF).   So that's two dynasties he's faced.   And this doesn't even take into account the fact that we would be calling some of his opponents ""dynasties"" if he hadn't beaten them. For example the Utah Jazz, if he had lost to them in '97 and '98 they would be back back champs and they would be considered an all-time team. Just by virtue of Jordan beating damn near everyone in he faced in the 90s gives him less of a chance to ""have gone up against dynasties"". Which is why that's an extremely misleading argument.   &gt; Yeah Jordan gave the celtics 43 in the first round and got swept, is that supposed to impress me?   You completely missed the point. That series (and the previous one against the Bucks) illustrates how Jordan could do more with shitty teammates against elite defensive teams than Lebron could, despite the narrative that ""Lebron can carry harder"". When they both faced an elite team (the Celtics vs the 2007 Spurs), Jordan played a lot better and got swept because of how bad his team was. Whereas Lebron played like trash and was one of the biggest reasons his team got swept.   &gt; Okay so you claim that team was better than any team lebron faced besides the Celtics? as if the spurs with 4 HOF cant contest that claim lol.  Look, it's clear to me that you don't know much about that era from the comments you're making, so you really need to read up on the history of the NBA. That '86 Celtics team is widely considered a top 3 team of all time (Behind the '96 Bulls and the Warriors).   Don't believe me?   Here's an [example](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/13000418/where-golden-state-warriors-rank-50-greatest-nba-teams)  And [another one ](https://247sports.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/ContentGallery/ESPN-ranks-the-20-best-NBA-teams-ever-121160397/#121160397_10)  Sure the Spurs had 4 future HOFers, but only 2 were in their primes (really only Parker, but I'll include Duncan too since he was playing well). Ginobili was starting to get washed and Kawhi wasn't an elite player yet.  Whereas the Celtics had 5 HOFers, 4 of which were in their primes. That included Larry Bird, who won the MVP that year and was better than any player LeBron ever faced. That team had 3 players who were all-stars that year, and 2 who made an all-defense team (the 2013 Spurs had only 2 all-stars and 1 member on the all-defense team, the 2014 spurs had 1 all-star and and 1 all-defense member)  &gt; Are we just not going to address his game 1 performance in 2018?  Go ahead and address it. And then we can also address Jordan's 63 point game against the above mentioned '86 Celtics (who had a better defense than the 2018 Warriors). We can also address his 46 point game against the '89 Pistons (also a better defense than the 2018 Warriors) where he scored more than half his team's points.    &gt;  We are just going to have to agree to disagree on the significance to the meaning and use of the AST%  We can disagree on the signifigance, but not the meaning. What I explained was the correct definition of Assist %. It purely measures how many of your teams field goals you assist.   &gt; How can you argue passing ability wouldn't affect this stat?   I've already explained it to you twice. Being the main ballhandler is 90% of this stat.   &gt;  Also i looked up the leaders. for the 2018 season, I couldnt find JJ on teh top 10  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2018_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ast_pct  He's 2nd on the list lol. JJ Barea over Lebron James, Dennis Schroeder and Kris Dunn and Jarrett Jack over guys like Lowry and Rubio  &gt; JJ Barea is an incredible passer, thats one of his only and elite skills in the league lol.   Lmao JJ Barea is not an elite passer. He's slightly better than average at best, the only reason he ranked so highly for AST% that season is because he ran the Mav's bench offense. Since they had almost no other shot creators/ball handlers, Barea ended up getting the bulk of the assists. He's a career 3.9 assist per game passer for a reason.   &gt; it was guys like, Westbrook, Dlo, Chris Paul, Harden, Trae Young, Simmons.  You're looking at the 2019 list. And this one proves my point too. DLo for example isn't aywhere near a passer as CP3 and Harden and Lebron. Kyrie doesn't belong in the top 10.  &gt; Notice any correlation between these names, some of the best passers in the league.  The point isn't that good passers won't have a high AST%. The point is that it's primary ball handlers and offense initiators who would have the highest AST%. That's the actual correlation that you should have noticed.   &gt; I don't see any mediocre passing system players from your Player A scenario who I can attribute playstyle or team setup  I've just given you multiple examples. But you would rather falsely claim that these players (like Barea) are elite passers rather than admit that you didn't understand the shortcomings of AST% as a stat.  Here's another (slightly different) example as to why AST% isn't a very informative stat. LeBron's AST% in the rose a massive 13% in the 2018 playoffs compared to the 2017 playoffs. Did he all of a sudden become a much better passer? Of course not. The difference was because Kyrie Irving was no longer on team, so Lebron is handling the ball even more and assisting an even larger percentage of his team's field goals.  This is why comparing 2 Assist Percentages tells us so little about the actual differences in the passing ability.   &gt; You don't seem to understand the point I am trying to make and how I am interpreting AST%, I am evaluating who is proficient at creating open looks  That's not the correct interpretation of the stat though. You can't just interpret stats however you want.   Why wouldn't you just use Assists per game (or Assists per 100 possessions to account for pace), since those are a much better indicator of who is proficient at creating open looks.  &gt; Also most of Lebrons round 1 series ended in less than 5 games so difference in series length is null and void. Also Lebron has played more playoff games because he's been to the finals 3 more times   Yeah, but Jordan has less of a chance to play more games when series are best of 5. That's just a fact, it's inarguable lol. For example it took Lebron 6 games to beat the Wizards in the first round in 2 separate seasons. Whereas it was impossible for a first round series to go 6 games in Jordan's time. And Lebron has been to the finals more times because of the easier conference. That's also a fact. And we aren't even arguing over player's longevity, clearly Lebron's is better. But when we're comparing their play when they were on the court, rate stats are far better."
"Same reason people hate LeBron James, Tom Brady, etc. They're winners, they're transcendent athletes, and they've been at it for a long time. People hate when current stars become better than who they grew up watching.  Everything about Curry is awesome. The most entertaining player I've ever seen, best shooter ever, amazing handles and I love his personality."
That BB Ref link you put up for MJ claims it only has official numbers from 2000 on. Right off the bat I can see that his buzzer beater against Cleveland in 89 is missing.  This link has a slightly different criteria but it still backs up my defense of Brons clutchness. (Was not trying to take a shot at MJ)  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1649603-comparing-lebron-james-playoff-buzzer-beating-shots-to-michael-jordans-best
"My list:  1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Kareem Abdul Jabbar 4. Magic Johnson 5. Larry Bird 6. Bill Russell 7. Shaquille O'Neal 8. Wilt Chamberlain 9. Tim Duncan 10. Hakeem Olajuwon  **Jordan**: In my mind, an easy #1. There is no player in the history of the league that comes to his greatness. He popularized basketball around the globe. He is an absolute icon in the sports world and beyond. 6-0 in the Finals and 5 MVPs. One of the select few players to win both MVP and DPOY--Jordan was just a complete player. I don't think there's much to discuss here. I imagine his greatness would be even more absurd had he never retired the first two times.   &amp;#x200B;  **LeBron**: I'm not sure if there's anything LeBron can do to ever overtake Jordan as the GOAT. I do think, however, that he as established himself as the clear #2 for quite some time now. I believe he's been the best player in the league since about 2007--and the analytics seem to agree. From 2009-2013, LeBron was the closest thing we have seen to peak Jordan. He's taken a step back since his second stint in Cleveland, but come playoff time--it is hard to argue that he still isn't the best player in the world.  &amp;#x200B;  **Kareem**: The All-Time NBA leading scorer (although LeBron has a very realistic chance of overtaking him). 6x NBA Champion, 6x League MVP. Famed for the unstoppable sky hook, KAJ defined 70s basketball. Before Jordan and James came along, Kareem was the GOAT. In some peoples' minds, he probably still is.   &amp;#x200B;  **Magic**: Perhaps the greatest point guard and showman in the history of the league. 5x NBA Champion, 3x MVP. The leader of the Showtime Lakers. Like Kareem, I believe Magic defined 80s basketball. However, he was one of the two that truly began to popularize the sport around the world with his brand of basketball and playstyle.   &amp;#x200B;  **Bird**: The other player that defined 80s basketball and truly popularized the sport. 3x NBA Champion, along with with 3 straight League MVPS. I believe Bird was a unique player for his time (along with Magic), and I think his style would dominate in all eras. I always rank Bird just behind Magic because these two rivals would write the history of the league together.   &amp;#x200B;  **Russell**: I don't think Bill gets much love around here. The fact is that he is an 11x NBA Champion and 5x League MVP. He is probably the greatest player of the 60s and greatest defensive player of all time. He deserves to be in the top 10. He was the centerpiece of the most dominant dynasty the league will ever see.   &amp;#x200B;  **Shaq**: I believe Shaq is the most dominant player in league history. Once he got to the post, there was no stopping him. He demanded double and triple teams every time he touched the ball. He is a 4x champion, but only a 1x MVP. When he was motivated, he was also a force on the defensive end. If I were to rank every player by their absolute peak, I believe Shaq is a clear top 3 player of all-time and has a very strong case to be ranked #1. For these reasons, he is in my top 10.   &amp;#x200B;  **Wilt**: He gives Shaq a run for his money as the most dominant player ever. He also gives Russell a run for his money as the greatest player of the 60s. Wilt has records that will never be touched. He has 4 MVPs and 2 Championships to his name. I believe he deserves a spot in the top 10.   &amp;#x200B;  **Duncan**: Like other greats, Duncan was the centerpiece of his respective team's dynasty. He anchored the Spurs for 20 years and propelled them to 5 Championships. During his peak, he won 2 back-to-back MVPs and nearly 3-peated in 2004. I believe he was the best player of the 2000s.   &amp;#x200B;  **Hakeem**: Although he is only a 2x NBA Champ and 1x MVP, I still have Hakeem in my top 10. He is one of the only 2 players to ever win MVP and DPOY in the same year, and he also has an additional DPOY to his name. I believe Hakeem is the best defensive player of all-time. And his offensive arsenal, famed by his Dream Shake, is still studied to this day by modern NBA players.   &amp;#x200B;  I genuinely believe these 10 are the greatest players in the league's history. The order can perhaps be re-arranged, but I cannot bring myself to omit any of these 10 names.   &amp;#x200B;  *Honorable mentions: Oscar Robertson, Kobe Bryant, Jerry West*"
"the eyebrows really throwing me off haha, but bron looks kinda like [bryce](https://www.talkbasket.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LeBron-James-Bryce-Maximus-James-1019670.jpg)"
"Yeah, if someone has a resentment towards a guy because of basketball reasons, I can understand that. I also have ""block by James"" in my head and I resent Lebron for that while respecting what an amazing player he is. But there were seriously guys throwing around only mouth guard and shimmy arguments and I cant get that."
This is also a testament to how shitty the old all star game format was. imagine playing a televised game so pointless that lebron james half asses a layup and misses.
Lebron James
Yeah unfortunately we settled for LeBron James.   Lavine isn't on the same level as those guys and went on National TV talking about how he wants to play with LeBron and AD. He's also on a garbage team that isn't going anywhere.
"He’s slightly taller than LeBron, he’s basically 6’10”   https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/nba-official-player-heights-kevin-durant-lebron-james-anthony-davis-dwight-howard"
My List  1. Lebron James 2. Michael Jordan 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. Wilt Chamberlain 5. Magic Johnson 6. Hakeem Olajuwon 7. Larry Bird 8. Tim Duncan 9. Kobe Bryant 10. Shaquille O'Neal     no Bill Russell isn't top 10 for me
"&gt; oh boy the old,"" the east was stronger argument"" moving the goalposts  I dont think you know what moving the goalposts means. It's a fact that the East was stronger during Jordan's time, and this is a relevant point to bring up when you start claiming that Jordan couldn't have made the finals with teams that Lebron had   &gt; even though lebron single handily beat an almost 60 win Pistons team who had the best defense in the league  Lmao how are you going to talk about me moving the goalposts when you're straight up lying now?   The Pistons were a 53 win team, not even close to ""almost 60 wins"". They only had 3 more wins than the Cavs, and were only 1 seed higher. They also did not have the best defense in the league,  they weren't even top 5 defensively. In fact, the Cavs actually had a better defensive rating than the Pistons, and were only 1 spot behind them in Net Rating.   Did you forget that Ben Wallace (who was the one who anchored their elite defense) wasn't on the team that year?   People forget that it was the Cavs defense who carried them for most of the season and playoffs. And LeBron wasn't even a good defender yet, it was his teammates who were carrying the defense.They were 4th in DRTG, and only 18th in ORTG (with Lebron ""elevating"" his teammates). Compare that that to Jordan in his first few seasons, when he had a worse team than LeBron did, and he yet his offenses were never outside the top 15 for ORTG.  Jordan carried his early teams' offenses harder and better than Lebron did, they just didn't go far in the playoffs because unlike Lebron he was actually facing elite teams in the East. Like when he hung 43 a game on the '86 Celtics, meanwhile when Lebron got to the 2007 finals and actually faced an elite defensive team in the Spurs (2nd defensively in the league), he was easily shut down.  Did you even watch the 2007 finals? People think the Cavs got dominated because it was a sweep, but it was one of the closest sweeps ever. Three games were decided by single digits, including a 1 point game and a 3 point game. This is with LeBron averaging 69% on free throws, 35% from the field, and 16% from outside the paint. He also averaged 6 turnovers to only 7 assists. He was awful. If he even hit 75% of his free throws and 20% of his jumpshots, that series would have gone 6 games at the least. The Spurs whole gameplan was to sag off LeBron and force him to shoot jumpers, because they knew he couldn't make them.   Compare that to Jordan's age 22 season, he also faced the 2nd best defensive team in the league in the playoffs (while having a worse supporting cast than Lebron did in 2007). But he still well, because he had a more complete offensive game than Lebron. He averaged 30 and 9 assists with 4 turnovers per game on 57% TS, compared to Lebron's 22 and 7 with 6 turnovers per game on 43% TS against the Spurs.  Then in his age 23 season he averaged 43 and 6 on 58% TS against the '86 Celtics, who were not only the best defense in the league, but also a top 3 team all-time to this day (and a better team than Lebron has ever faced outside of the Warriors).   But because Jordan lost to these teams people say Lebron can carry a team further, even though he was just beating up weaker teams than this and when he faced similarly talented teams like the Spurs he performed much worse than Jordan.  &gt; Yo do me a favor and please stop explaining the meaning of the stat,  But you clearly did not know what the stat actually measured lol. If you did, you wouldn't have brought it up.   &gt; How does that have nothing to do with passing ability? They are literally dependent on each other, you can't be a mediocre passer and end up on the all time AST% list  There are plenty of average to barely above average passers on the list. Because it has almost nothing to do with passing ability.   Brevin fucking Knight ranks in the top 10 all time for assist percentage (higher than Lebron). Jose Calderon ranks higher than James Harden. Both of these players were MUCH worse passers than LeBron and Harden.  The reason they rank higher is because of their role. AST% literally only measures how many of your teams field goals you assist on. A mediocre passer who plays with amazing scorers will have a higher assist percentage than an elite passer who can also score and who plays with other ballhandlers.  Let me simplify it for you: Player is A is a mediocre passer but there are no other ballhandlers or passers on his team so he is the starting point guard. He plays with elite shooters and scorers, so his role is to run plays and pass to his scorers. He will have a sky high AST% because he rarely shoots, and his teammates shoot a ton, so he will assist on a higher percentage of his teams field goals.  Player B is an elite passer, who is also a good scorer, and plays with other good ball handlers. Sometimes he initiates the offense and passes to cutters or open shooters, and sometimes he looks for his own shot. And sometimes he plays off-ball and lets his other teammates initiate the offense. But because he looks for his shot more often (and you can't assist on your own field goals), and because his teammates also initiate the offense (and thus assist on their own share of the team's field goals as well), Player B's assist % will be lower than player A's despite being a far better passer.     Look at the assist % leaders from the 2018 season. JJ Barea is second on the list lol, ahead of both Harden and Lebron for example.   Jrue Holiday, Jokic, and Ricky Rubio are all behind Jerian Grant, Jarret Jack, and Tyreke Evans lol.   Because assist percentage pretty much only tells us who the main ball handler and offense initiator was. Obviously good passers will often be the main ball handler and the guy running the offense, but so will lesser passers who play on a team without other good passers. And great passers who share the court with other good passers or who also pull double duty as scorers will have their assist % suppressed. That's why people don't use it as a stat to compare people's passing ability.  If you don't want me to explain stats to you, then know what they actually measure.   &gt; Rate stats are not the only applicable measurement here, considering they have both played 13 playoff seasons at this point  But LeBron has more games played, not only because he played in a weaker conference where it was easier to get to the next round, but more importantly because when Jordan played the first round only went up to 5 games. No one is arguing that LeBron doesn't have better longevity, obviously that's true, but when they were on the court Jordan was better offensively (and overall)."

"Daily reminder that the 2015 Bulls with an MVP-level Rose, and Butler, Gasol and Noah came one LeBron James-buzzer beater away from going 3-1 ahead on the series. To this day I still believe Chicago could've gotten out of the East and put up a fight vs Golden State."
"I saw all the smoke interview of Shannon Sharpe, with Matt and Jack and Shannon said that when he met skip and talked to him he realised that it's just a persona that skip puts on when he talks on TV but he actually believes LeBron James sucks as a basketball player, great interview overall but it really opened my eyes when I heard it coming from Shannon, the fact that this man is so hell bend into turning all of LeBrons accomplishments in a conversation just a fluke cause of someone else's hard work or someone else's failure, the dude knows basketball and knows the craft being a journalist for many years but damn LeBron, LeBron man, I mean if it was someone else then maybe OK you might be somewhat right but LeBron man, like everything that comes out of his mouth about that man is bullshit."
"Your free throw rate is much lower off of post up fga than drives. LeBron always gets most of his free throws in transition. Okay let's look at game 3 where LeBron had 24 fta:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70AUcQ3PzQ4  0:43  clear goal tend when ball is already on top of cylinder and crossed it.   1:21 classic shoulder dip foul uncalled but I guess that's normal   2:44 flop   3:24  charge but an and-1 instead   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlbgHSVbAt0  5:29  again another offensive foul where defender is purely vertical and James jumps in but refs give him a VERY late whistle   24:50  not every time though, despite it being the exact same thing   34:24 one of the few legit blocking fouls   51:32 another classic bulldoze foul   1:11:30 shouldn't be a foul but eh. Compare it to 1:38:20 which is legitimate foul   1:04:06  many offensive fouls uncalled  1:47:30 blatant superstar call"
"The ive looked at his resume the more ive felt like rick barry is a top 20 player of all time.   He averaged 35ppg in a season which is something other great scorers like pete maravich/allen iverson/ elvin hayes never did in there high usage seasons.  He's one of the best passing forwards in nba history averaging nearly 6 assist per game for 6 years in his career from 1973-74 to 1978-79 and his career high of 19 assist is as high or higher than other great point forwards like lebron james(19),scottie pippen(15), larry bird(17),grant hill(14).   His career highest scoing game is 64 points which is higher than other scorers like george gervin(63),jerry west(63),carmelo anthony(62),tracy mgrady(62),damian lilard(61),james harden(61),lebron james(61),shaquille o'neal(61),karl malone(61)  but that is unstating 64 point, as he is the only player in nba history to make 30 field goals in a game besides wilt chamberlain.  People like to say that guys from the 60's-70's had 3 point range but rick barry actually has seasons where he was taking and hitting 3's such as his 1971-72 aba season where he was making 0.9 3 pointers a game and his final season where he made 1.0 threes a game,and he has made a total of 176 3 pointers on record, his career high in 3 pointers made at 8 is just as high as lebrons at 8, you can actually say that were he to play with a 3 pointer for his whole career that he would have scored more.  He's the best free throw shooter ever, while steve nash has the highest career free throw % at .904, he did while taking just 2.78 free throws a game or 3384 total free throws, but barrys career .893 is on a much larger sample size of  6.27 per game or 6397 which is a full 3013 more attempts.  His 1974-75 championship run is comparable to dirk and hakeems championship runs, although he didnt have to go through as many teams a dirk and hakeem, but his team was much worse than dirks 57 win mavericks or hakeems 58 win rockets while barrys  warriors were at just 48 wins while sweeping the 60 win washington bullets.  When he got his championship he got a finals mvp. When julius erving,stephen curry, scottie pippen,kevin garnett,david Robinson,jerry west,oscar Robertson,clyde drexler,kevin mchale got there chip they didnt get finals mvp, but berry did, so he should be more respected for getting a championship and finals mvp.  As one last thing for this wall of text, he never truly had to the opportunity to get an mvp which make him be perceived as a greater all time player and that his prime  in the aba and even then he was injury prone,when rick berry played the 1968-69 Oakland oaks were on pace for well over the the 60 wins which they got he played for his 35 games."
"people believe curry changed the game because teams had to alter their gameplan and makeup of their roster inorder to compete with the warriors. however, this was not the sole doing of curry, because their small ball lineup was made possible because of klay, draymond, iggy, and obviously steph. i think people forget that the hampton 5 warriors only had one ring. that the warriors blew a 3-1 with curry at the helm. going 6/19 in game 7, 0/6 from three in the fourth, and the terrible late game turnover. the finals they did win, was against lebron james, and his supporting cast of timmofey mozgov, jr smith, and tristan thompson, and they still took them to 6."
"(I'm using per 36 because both players are playing almost exactly 3.6 minutes, so just divide their stats by 10 to see what they actually average)  Lou Williams (24 games):  Per 36 of 27.8/2.5/7.2 with 2.9 turnovers, 1.3 steals, and 0.4 blocks  - Shooting splits of 47.8/42.1/82.4 (61.71 TS%)  Lebron James (27 games):  - Per 36 of 23.3/10/9.6 with 4.1 turnovers and 1.8 steals  - Shooting splits of 33.3/17.2/62.1 (43.29 TS%)  Lou Williams has a +/- of 7.2 and Lebron has a +/- of 8.9  Lebron is statistically slightly more impactful probably because he is much better in general and impacts the game in more ways, so him playing below average is still much better than Lou Williams. However, I think its fair to say Lou Williams is more clutch statistically because his expectations are much much lower and hes elevating his play, meanwhile Lebron plays worse in the clutch.  Fun facts:  Despite averaging less fga and having played in less games, lou williams has scored more points than bron.  Bron has recorded 0 blocks in ""clutch time"" meanwhile lou williams got 1"

Lou Williams has a +/- of 0.7 and Lebron has a +/- of 0.9  Lebron is statistically slightly more impactful probably because he is much better in general, so him playing below average is still much better than Lou Williams. However, I think its fair to say Lou Williams is more clutch statistically because his exceptions are much much lower and hes elevating his play, meanwhile Lebron has played worse in the clutch."
Lots of residual anti clutch propaganda agaim   He's made more of these shots in the playoffs than MJ or Kobe:  Game-tying/go-ahead field goals with under 10 seconds left in the postseason:  Michael Jordan: 7/15 (47%) Kobe Bryant: 5/22 (23%) LeBron James: 12/23 (52%)
LeBron James
LeBron James.. This narrative needs to change y'all! He's the clutchest player in NBA history and he's the king of game 7s.. well him and Bill Russell. LeBron James has killer instinct! That doesn't look right but damnit it's the truth!
I actually had to think for a second there who James is. You almost never hear lebron referred to by just his last name
"&gt; So yeah Jordan was no slouch in that department, but he wasn't dragging bums to the finals like Lebron James either.   Because when he played, the Eastern conference was actually the stronger one.   He dropped 45 points per game on the '86 Celtics with a worse team than Lebron has ever had, he definitely would not struggle to carry scrubs in this century's soft East.  &gt; Jordan had a marginally higher OBPM, 8.8 vs 7.6  That isn't a marginal difference lol. A 1.2 advantage in BPM is a decent gap. It's practically the same difference as between Lebron and Durant's OBPM.   &gt; For instance in the playoffs Lebron has had a higher True shooting percentage, assist percentage, offensive win shares, and VORP.  You do realize that win shares and VORP are volume stats, and not rate stats right? I would expect LeBron to lead there, seeing as he has played more playoff games. Jordan beats him in win shares/48 as well as offensive win shares/48.   True shooting is another thing LeBron should lead in, considering the fact that this era is more efficient than Jordan's era and that LeBron has had much better help and spacing on offense.  And yet he only leads by 1%. That's practically the definition of only ""marginally better"", especially since Jordan scored at a much higher volume.  I don't think you realize what assist percentage measures. It's purely the amount of your team's field goals you assist. It's one of the least useful stats you could have brought up. It has nothing to do with passing ability, and all to do with a players role on offense and how many other ball handlers they share the court with. That's why Lebron trails guys like Deron Williams, Mark Jackson, and and Brevin Knight in career assist percentage, despite them all being far worse passers.   &gt; Stats are easily manipulatable based on your argument  Sure, when you don't know what they actually measure and and in which contexts they should be compared   &gt; Statistically these guys are both studs  I agree, but when it comes to offense Jordan had the edge"
"When did i ever argue MJ could make plays for others or be a distributor? You're comparing his skills as a playmaker to arguably one of if the the greatest playmakers/passers in NBA history. So yeah Jordan was no slouch in that department, but he wasn't dragging bums to the finals like Lebron James either. One of LBJ's greatest strengths has always been his ability and willingness to elevate his teammates.   Jordan had a marginally higher OBPM, 8.8 vs 7.6. Considering the league was less offensively gifted in the 90s it isn't as impressive of a stat comparatively.   Statistically these guys are both studs in their own ways and we could have a pissing match all day throwing numbers at eachother. For instance in the playoffs Lebron has had a higher True shooting percentage, assist percentage, offensive win shares, and VORP. Stats are easily manipulatable based on your argument so I have little intereest in stats unless your argument is VERY STRONG, and at this point we're debating GOAT offensive player between LBJ and MJ so were splitting hairs anyway."

Kyle lowry is more important to success of the raps than lebron james
"Lebron James is not the most versatile defender to ever play the game, Jordan was a significantly better defender than Lebron and that’s just one example. Where is Lebron’s defensive player of the year award then? Where does Lebron rank is all defensive team appearances? How about the vast number of other players who also can guard multiple positions at a higher level? Almost every reply you’ve had has been a thought provoking analysis as to why you’re wrong, you’re just refusing to acknowledge them."
"So lots of fans do this, particularly Lebron and Kobe fans. Whenever someone says that that player isn’t the best you are a hater. I listed my top 5 both currently and all time and was called a hater because they I didn’t have lebron James number one and Kobe Bryant in my top 5 and the same for my current list. It’s not that hard to be fan of someone and not think they’re the greatest"
"Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell. Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Kobe Bryant, Pete Maravich/Tim Duncan."
Your franchise missed the playoffs with fucking Lebron James. Even the Cavs had that shit figured out. Yet the summer after another Superstar is able to demand out because your located in LA.   The Lakers having the most storybook franchise is why we can spread the wealth by sacrificing their season for others. Lebron don't deserve it but neither does Charlotte. That ain't selfish that's fair.
Making shit up? What did I make up lol LeBron James is the most versatile defender to ever play he can still guard point guards and centers. He's just physically different. Not as skilled as MJ though. I have about 30 replies and not one person has actually addressed one point ive made lmao y'all are creepy..Get off Mike's dick
"1) MJ (the best that may ever do it) 2) LeBron James (LBJ has to be 2nd, I can't think of any player better than him besides one) 3) Kareem (20 years, most points ever, six MVPS) 4) Russell (Yes I'm factoring in historical significance but also Russell had an INSANE hunger for winning, one of those people that the more you know about him, the more you realize why he's regarded so highly. 5) Magic (saved the league, greatest point guard) 6) Kobe (was on track to have 20+ year career of all star play before the Achilles injury) 7) Bird (saved the league, absolutely dominant and special in his prime.  Insanely competitive) 8) Chamberlain (Wilt was the greatest athlete ever in the league but left a lot to be desired when it came to winning, a lot of that was on him) 9) Hakeem (was just a terrifyingly talented force on both sides and could've beat MJ in they met in the finals if he had more talent around him IMO) 10) Shaq (His prime was probably the most unfair player ever to play, played 19 or 20 years, most of it as the best player or an all-star)"
"Okay. So LeBron James went back to cold-weather Cleveland for 4 years, Dwyane Wade went to cold-weather Chicago to end his.  Same with Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce."
[Magic said that if James wins 2 or 3 more championships he’ll be the greatest ever](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/magic-johnson-lebron-james-jordan-greatest-player-all-time-debate-2020-1%3famp)   That was not the reason I brought up the article. In the article it says that some sports writers have Wilt as the greatest which is all that I said.

"I don’t think it’s carelessness or that the lists are poorly thought out. There are straight up more than ten guys who have stacked cases for being top ten.  Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabar, Hakeem Olajuwon, Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Tim Duncan, Jerry West(before you say anything, the dude is literally the NBA logo), Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Oscar Robertson, and I could even understand a case for guys like John Stockton and Karl Malone.  That’s 15 dudes with solid cases for top ten and two with understandably solid cases as well."
"Lebron James poisoned our water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague unto our houses"
"„And, as for the situation in Hong Kong itself, James still didn't have much to say at all: ""I felt like with this particular situation, it was something that not only was I not informed enough about, I just felt like it was something that not only myself and my teammates or our organization had enough information to even talk about it at that point in time, and we still feel the same way.""“  Again, your argument is LeBron was made to feel unsafe without knowing why.  Personally I don’t think he’s THAT stupid"
"I’m gonna day LeBron James, but he always proves us wrong"
"1. Michael Jordan 2. Lebron James 3. Wilt Chamberlain 4. Kareem Abdul Jabbar 5. Magic Johnson 6. Larry Bird 7. Hakeem Olajuwon 8. Shaq O'Neal 9. Bill Russell 10. Kobe Bryant  Kobe and Tim Duncan are essentially tied for me, I used to have Duncan higher but realized eventually that I was overrating certain aspects of Duncan when comparing him to Kobe (such as efficiency). I probably have Hakeem higher than most, but I legitimately think that Hakeem's 93-95 Rockets would have stopped Jordan's Bulls even if Jordan didn't retire."
"I would disagree that the city has solid FA attracting power. If anything, the team has shown several times it cannot attract the Tier 1 free agents like Grant Hill, Lebron James, or Carmelo Anthony. It does better with the Tier 2 free agents like Carlos Boozer or late career Dwyane Wade and Pau Gasol."

Lebron James?

"lebron if memphis got that 1st pick, they won 50 games the next year without adding a lottery player, have him next to Pau, runnin with white chocolate, bonzi, james posey, mike miller and shane battier? that would have been fun team to watch develop  also lebron with detroit, add him to that lineup that won in 04 anyway (assuming they still trade for sheed) daaaaang, billups, rip, bron, sheed, ben wallace, with tayshaun off the bench? that would ve been a squad  also carmelo with that detroit team  lamarcus aldridge, if bulls wouldnt have traded him, front court of him, deng, and tyson chandler would have been nice, with hinrich at pg  and then ben gordon plus hopefully any other shooting guard they couldlve added instead of ben wallace,   keith van horn if San Antonio wouldve got the send, worse for them then getting duncan, but for him better to go there than NJ   rubio if he wouldve got picked by knicks instead o wolves, would have come over right away, instead of stalled development in barca, wouldve been in a D'antoni offense, n had amare and gallinari n tyson chandler (not right then but shortly thereafter)  Durant to portland, wouldve slotted right next aldridge and brandon roy (already a 54 win team without him)  pau, one pick lower and he goes to chicago, teaming up with tyson chandler, hinrich and deng  darko, two picks lower and he goes to miami with odom, butler and wang zhizhi, with stan van gundy coaching a rebuild and not larry brown screwin up his career  kevin love- 1 pick higher n he goes to seattle to team up with durant (and presumably later harden), 2 picks lower he goes LAC n fits in better next to cp3 and deandre than blake did (though they were yet to be acquired)  gordon hayward and paul george- if either of them went 1 or 2 picks higher respectively they go to LAC and give them the SF they never had to run with cp3, blae and deandre (plus the shooting they needed) probably makes them a champion  brad beal, 1 pick lower n he's on cavs when bron comes back  kristaps, 1 pick higher and he goes to philly play inside out game with embiid  giannis, 1 pick higher and he slots in perfectly for utah playoff years before gordon hayward left  lauri markkanen, any other pick and he doesn't get the begining of his career shit on by the bulls   OG Anonuby, couple picks higher and he slots in perfectly on revamped oladipo pacers"
"What about free agency? I know it’s shit, but look at it this way. If Lebron James plays 2 half seasons he most likely isn’t breaking Kareem’s record. That’s not the biggest thing, but this season was already mostly over. They aren’t playing in the next couple months then the season needs to just be cancelled. China already tried to come back, players got sick again, and they just flat out cancelled it. I’m sure they are trying to figure some way to get it back, but if we get to May the answer should be cancelled. I’m not a fan of it, and it definitely blows but there are more important things than a 2020 champ."

"&gt; bringing borderline garbage teams to the playoffs  In his early years with the Cavs, he brought a team with Mo Will as his 2nd best player TO THE FINALS, and not to mention brought old man Korver and JR Smith to the 2018 Finals while Kevin Love was his second best player shooting 46% from the field as a big man. Those 2 are very easily garbage teams and, shown last season, had no business being even a 9th seed without LeBron James.   Also, while Davis was very clearly not on an amazing team in his first playoff appearance, it was not as bad as people make it out to be. Tyreek Evans, Jrue Holiday, and Eric Gordon all played well that year, with his 2nd playoff appearance having Boogie and Jrue, along with above average role players like Rondo, Mirotic, Moore, and limitedTony Allen.   I specifically stated in my comment carrying teams *to* the playoffs. Harden, last year, managed to bring his team to home court advantage despite 3 of his 4 best teammates all suffering injuries that would keep them under 70 games on the year.   The closest Davis has gotten to LeBron and Harden-level jobs was getting a slightly below average playoff team to a bottom seed"
"Lebron james brought a borderline garbage team to the finals once. His Miami team had the stars and role players that worked well during the regular and post season. The 2nd run with the Cavs wasnt as deep but he still had a young star in kyrie, and Kevin love, who even with a diminished role and didnt play as well still only benefitted the team.   And anthony davis did bring his team to the playoffs. Matter of fact he did it twice. Both times the teams were garbage, and the first time he didnt even have boogie to help him and jrue carry the load.  And harden for most of the playoffs had chris paul, capela, and tucker on the floor. The hell are you talking about?"
You’re not a superstar if you can’t bring a borderline garbage teams to the playoffs. See: Harden last year w/ all of the injuries and LeBron James in like half of his career
"The key tenet to my arhument was that he was a much better scorer than 2007 LeBron James which still holds true considering he scored 49 points against the big three Celtics in his first game and then followed it up with a 63 point scoring outburst as the only star on the '87 Bulls. The second part to this argument which you overlooked was that LeBron shot 36% from the field against the Spurs throughout the entire series, most notably however in the final two games which the Spurs won by a combined *4 points*. 22 year old Jordan is absolutely capable of pushing that series to 7 because he had the perfect skillset for it."
"Russell Wilson - Steph Curry (Both undersized and underrated. Both played a role in evolving the game. Extremely adaptable to their teammates.)   Tom Brady - LeBron James (All time greats who seem to ignore the effects of time. Enjoy silencing their critics who start to overlook them for younger talent.)   Aaron Rodgers - James Harden (Great players who are extremely talented, but are known for being the best at getting free plays.)   Lamar Jackson - Giannis Antetokounmpo (Unstoppable forces who are still evolving their game.)   Ryan Fitzpatrick - Lou Williams (Come off the bench and have the capability to absolutely light up the opponent.)   Patrick Mahomes - Luka Doncic (Electrifying players who have redefined what is expected of young players.)   Deshaun Watson - Damian Lillard (Clutch players who often get let down by the rest of the team.)   Drew Brees - Klay Thompson (Extremely accurate, always putting up good numbers, but usually overshadowed by others.)   Jameis Winston - Russell Westbrook (Love to fill up the stat sheet, especially the turnover column.)   Kyler Murray - Trae Young (Younger versions of already great players.)   Baker Mayfield  - Kyrie Irving (Known as much for his play on the court/field as off of it.)   Nick Foles - Kevin Durant (You add him to your team if you want a guaranteed win in the big games.)"
"They’re not “legit garbage” without James. How many games did AD play without Lebron? What’s their record in those games? What teams did they play? Unless he played like 25 games without Lebron, it’s not a large enough sample size."
"Kevin Garnett has shit rosters for years and still managed to make the playoffs consistently. Kobe Bryant dragged a trash Lakers team to a 3-1 lead over the 54-28 Suns. Plenty of players have led trash teams to the playoffs in the West.   Again, why are the Lakers garbage without James? Shouldn’t Davis’ “superstar” level play at least keep them neutrals instead of totally trash? What’s the excuse there?   Do the Lakers fall apart when it’s just LeBron leading the show? No. Do the Clippers fall apart totally when Paul George leads the show? No. Do the Bucks fall apart when Middleton leads the show? No.   The later two aren’t even superstars lmfao."
Steph Curry - Russell Wilson  Both undersized wizards with the ball. Among the top tier in their positions and have both won titles. Have also lost titles in heartbreaking fashion (Kyries clutch 3 and Malcolm Butler INT)   Russell Westbrook -Tyreek Hill Electric with the ball. Both play the game at breakneck speed. Modern day cheetahs with the ball.    Lebron James - Tom Brady  Today's GOATS of each sport. Multiple title winners + multiple haters.    Kawhi Leonard - Aaron Donald  Both drafted in the teens and went to smaller colleges.  Both guys dont say much but let their defense do the talking.  Multiple defensive players of the year awards. Both feared on the court and field.    Dwight Howard - Cam Newton Both former number 1 draft picks due to their freakish athleticism. Both would become all stars and perform at elite levels leading to both being nicknamed Superman. Both reached the pinnacles of their respective sports whilst facing adversity. Both on track for great comeback seasons
LeBron James would be the undisputed greatest player ever   Shaquille O'Neal would have zero rings and would be seen as the ultimate empty stats player   Kobe Bryant would be shat on for his garbage end to the 2010 Finals (6/24 shooting) and wouldn't be close to as revered as he is now
By that same logic Lebron James couldn’t lead a mediocre team to the playoffs in the west either lmao. He literally failed to do just that last season
That 25/10 sure has led to a lot of success as the main guy and whenever LeBron James sits
"Yeah bro all his dominance on both sides of the ball has led the Lakers to -2.7 net rating without LeBron James, not even close to a .500 record in most seasons with him leading the team, and two playoff appearances in 7 years"
Lebron James is a balding dude with a five head and he looks like a 5 year old mixed with a 50 year old somehow. I don’t think most people really care

You're also conveniently ignoring Lebron James been the finals 4 more times."
"This is worse than the Thad Young one lmao. And apparently there's an error there since Millsap has 989 games played. This looks like a parody and it might be a good idea to start a movement with the most cherry picked stats we can find.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Who had all this but had the nerve to shoot 35% or better from 3?   Pau Gasol fits the criteria (1226 G, 17 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 1.6 BPG, 50.7 FG%) but apparently is too good of a 3pt shooter (wtf): 36.8 3PT% with 0.4 attempts per game in his career.   There's also Al Horford, but he only played 846 games so far and is too good of an outside shooter: 36% on 1.5 attempts a game. He's also barely at 14PPG and his scoring is on a downward spiral the last few seasons.  KD is also too good of an outside shooter to join this list and needs to play 49 more games to reach the GP criteria (assuming there's no typo there). Oh, and while doing it he also needs to chuck 3s at an abysmal percentage while also maintaining a FG% close to 50%.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Who got cut off at 897 games?  This is why I believe there's an error on the numbers of games since Bob Lanier (954 G) fits every criteria in there and he played a bit in the 3pt era shooting 15.4% on 13 career attempts. Maybe the amount of 3PA wasn't sufficient but there was nothing about the number you had to attempt. For example, Kareem only had a total of 18 3pt attempts in his career and Shaq only had 22 attempts for his career.  To reinforce the games played error, there's also David Robinson. The Admiral fits every criteria but ""only"" played 987 games, which is more than 898 but less that 989 (captain obvious, I know). Oh, and Larry Nance (the father obv) is in the same boat as Robinson but only appeared in 920 games.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Who got left out at 13.9 points?  The closest one is Mychal Thompson (Klay's dad) who could ""only"" average 13.7 for his career. That's assuming the games played part isn't a typo (it is) since he appeared in 935 games.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; 2.2 assists.   Chris Bosh averaged 2 APG for his career but he would be disqualified anyway since he didn't reach the games played quota (893 career games).  Leaving him out, there's LaMarcus Aldridge who fits every criteria save for assists as he dishes on average 2 a game for his career. Fun fact is he barely makes the cut for FG% with 49.1% for his career. Elton Brand fits every other criteria but only averaged 2.1 APG for his career, if only he was less selfish /s. Artis Gilmore only averaged 2 APG for his NBA career but would make the list if you also include his ABA days.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;0.9 blocks.  Danny Manning was close as he's only averaged 0.9 BPG for his career. But being an injury prone player, he ""only"" appeared in 883 career games and barely averaged 14PPG anyway.   There's also a bunch of players who couldn't make the cut because they ""only"" put up 0.8 BPG for their career:   \- LeBron James who the Lakers should totally play at small ball C and have him swat every shot instead of AD/McGee. Damn everything else.  \- Karl Malone should've spent more time protecting the rim as he was 331 blocks short in his career to join this list.  \- Charles Barkley would have needed 185 more career blocks to be as good a player as Millsap is. Really unfortunate for Sir Charles.  \- Alvan Adams was 180 blocks shorts of accomplishing this incredible feat. But non-shot blocking bigs, I tell ya.  \- Michael Jordan should've practiced his shot-blocking more during his playing days. Great career but not quite Paul Millsap great.  I hate that I have too much time to post detailed research on an obvious joke."

"Watching this, I am reminded of why it was a joy to see some of these players win championships. It was a journey to get there. Isiah Thomas got his ring that year at 28. Michael Jordan and LeBron James also won their first at 28. Steph did at 27. It is a different path than those who tasted success early - Tim Duncan (23), Kobe (22) and Magic (21)"

"“A player would be better if he had more possessions” yeah he also wouldn’t have been on as good of a team but he was great and made All Second team.   Lebron James takes high possession mid efficiency players and groups them together and thus they all have to be more efficient on their less possessions. He doesn’t make them worse. When DWade joined Lebron he scored his then highest FG% season ever and on above average FG attempts for him (almost highest)   AD is better than Pippen but LBJ hasn’t had an All NBA teammate since 2015, LBJ hasn’t had an All NBA teammate for 10 years of his career. Which is almost as long as Jordan’s Bulls Career. Hopefully they both could have made first team All NBA it would have been the first Time in Lebrons career ( I doubt it would have happened) but it’s Something Jordan had already done but no one knocks Jordan down for it so does it really matter?"
"My top 5 this year consists of LeBron, Giannis, Luka, AD and Kawhi.   Luka is just slightly better than James Harden for me this year, he's a better finisher and passer, and draws fouls at a comparable rate. Luka also isn't that far behind Harden as a shooter, he's abysmal off the catch, but is still decent off the dribble. He shoots similarly to Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young and Pascal Siakam on pull-ups, which isn't elite company per se, but it's not a big enough detriment to him to overshadow the other parts of his game that he's among the best in the league in."

Free  Derrick Rose  LeBron James  Alex English  Isiah Thomas, Dave Bing  Stephen Curry  James Harden  Magic Johnson, LeBron James  Dwyane Wade, LeBron James  Stephen Marbury  Baron Davis  Russell Westbrook  Penny Hardaway  Damian Lillard  John Wall  Here was my honest list without checking"
"Team B. Disgusting speed/athleticism and versatility with nice spacing and at their best years efficient as can be shooting.  Neat pick and roll opportunities too.   Team C has a suffocating interior defense, but lacks ability to defend the perimeter sans Hornets CP3 and Pippen (who would be guarding 2012-2013 James,  an absolute freak of physicality and skilled efficiency). With everyone at their best year, I can take serious advantage of that. Prime Wade posting Harden is a joke and Love lives outside where Ben Wallace doesn't make his DPOTY mark.  Team A is a tough one, but I feel Love and Dwight can control the boards.  Prime Dwight locks the paint from Giannis and we saw in the playoffs how that limits his game. I like Lebron on Curry, prime Wade (who was one of the GOAT SG defenders/blockers) on Klay, Dwight on Giannis and adjusting to make Draymond beat us there."
"jordan didn't beat anyone alone. Lebron has never played with anyone as good as Scottie Pippen.   I don't necessarily think that Lebron is ""greater"" than Jordan. I don't really understand these arguments. In terms of impact on the game in general, and overall importance in the history of basketball, I think they are about equal. In terms of purely their basketball skills and abilities, it's impossible to decide for me. They played against different competition, under different rules and in different situations and eras of the league. Both of them have done amazing things in basketball. When talking about the greats, I don't feel a need to compare them. How can you really compare players like James, Jordan, Chamberlain, Johnson? It's a team sport. I don't know. I don't see what people get out of debating it. It's not like there will ever be a right answer. If Lebron wins with LA, he'll be the first to win three rings with three different teams. Is that more impressive than two three-peats? No, but I also don't think it's necessarily *less* impressive."
"Here’s mine in no particular order, but the first few are some “Legacy” players since I think it’s important to include the non modern day players that didn’t make the original list.  - Dominique Wilkins - Bob McAdoo - Adrian Dantley - Alex English  - Gary Payton - Jason Kidd - Kobe Bryant - Tim Duncan - Kevin Garnett - Dirk Nowitzki - Allen Iverson - LeBron James - Steve Nash - Dwayne Wade - Stephen Curry - Kevin Durant - Russell Westbrook - James Harden - Chris Paul - Kahwi Leonard - Dwight Howard - Tracy McGrady - Ray Allen - Anthony Davis - Carmelo Anthony  If the first four weren’t added (since they didn’t make the original but I think it’s whack that Dominique/McAdoo didn’t get in for 50) then I could also see some high profile names like Dennis Rodman, Yao Ming, Deron Williams, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, Manu Ginobli, Kyrie Irving... I think though it’s really hard to remove any of the modern day players listed above (post-1997) when your factor in MVP’s, 1st Team All Pros/Defense, Titles, Stats...   I could definitely see Giannis getting in as the “Shaq” pick of the 75th Greatest Players list (Shaq got in the 50th Anniversary Team when many felt he did not deserve it yet as he had only been in the league 5 years at the time)."
LeBron James is overrated. I predict he won’t win the eastern championship ever again for the next 6 or something years
"When Lebron got blocked by Hezonja last year, I thought we had seen the last of ole GOAT James. Looks like it was just that the groin wasn't fully healed as he was back one year later in the MVP race"
"&gt;they refuse to acknowledge the teams he loses to have significantly better organizations and supporting casts.  Patently false, I dont think any other athlete in modern professional sports history has ever gotten the ""his opponents were better than him"" pass *except* Lebron.  Clayton Kershaw was in a division with a team with an MVP, two golden gloves, two Cy Young award winners, a manager of the year, and two FMVPs and never got the ""his opponents were better than him"" pass  Aaron Rodgers had no other pro bowlers in 2013 and went up against a 49ers team with 8 pro bowlers, and no one was like ""of course ARod lost, his opponents were better than him""  Even athletes in his own sport: James Harden had no other all stars on his team and pushed the same Warriors+KD team to 7 and 6, even he didnt get the ""his opponents were too stacked"" excuse, everyone calls Harden a playoff choker  Lebron is the only athlete in modern professional sports history that gets that pass as much as he does, his legacy is protected by soooo many talking heads"
**Michael Jordan (1988-1993)**  - 3 Rings  - 3 MVPs - 3 Finals MVPs - 7 Scoring Titles - 3 Steals Titles - 1 Defensive Player of the Year  **Lebron James (2003-2020)**  - 3 Rings - 4 MVPs - 3 Finals MVPs - 1 Scoring Title  Jordan played 911 less games...
"There’s something magical about Jordan that holds him over LeBron the same way that there’s something magical that keeps Jerry Rice above Randy Moss. James and Moss are bigger, faster, stronger, more gifted, and would put up a good fight in one-on-one competition, but if you’ve seen Rice or Jordan play, you just know. You can’t explain it, you just know. R-I-N-G-Z aside and everything, there’s just something about them."

Unpopular opinion: Doncic plays more like Jeremy Lin“Sanity” in Jeremy’s prime season than LeBron James in his
"lol cmon, Love ""not being mentally strong enough to handle being on a playoff team"" is such a BS argument. Love was a ball dominant scorer, and went to a team with Kyrie Irving and Lebron James.   He had to become the guy who sits in the corner, and his production obviously dropped off, like it would for ANY player, then when he had a problem w that, he gets subtweeted by their team captain.      Bron made Love a worse player, then when the Cavs lose, Bron's teammates always shoulder the blame for ""not showing up for some reason"""
"PG- Steph Curry  SG- Kobe Bryant  SF- LeBron James  PF- Dirk (I didn’t have the attention span to pay real close attention to the NBA until 2009ish, which was after Duncan’s peak)   C- Dwight"

Tony Parker leaving Lebron James to chase down Mario chalmers 🤦🏻‍♂️
"I'd put Karl Malone as more similar to LeBron James than LaMarcus Aldridge.  Wasn't as vertical or same handles as LeBron but he could fly down the open court with a similar, bigger frame."
Not kobmug though.  Who's opinion on basically anything seems to stem from an unhealthy obsession with Lebron James .  Nope not at all
"LeBron James is the greatest all around athlete, simply because of modern sports medicine."
We have this dude named Anthony Davis...  Most teams also don’t have LeBron James...
"I’ll upvote ya and add my take, Early in Pierce’s career he was a SG against the likes of AI and Kobe. When he switched to SF he was competing against Lebron James and Carmelo Anthony while being in the same draft class as Dirk and VC. He’s always consistently been the 1b option to what will go down as a golden age of 1a players. He was all nba 3rd team the year he lead the league in points scored. AI averaged more per game. But 3rd team to an above average defender that scored more points than anyone else in the league really highlights his career story. In an Iso era where guys like Joe Johnson made their career, Pierce was just flat out better than almost anyone he matched up against on a nightly basis. I don’t know how the numbers translate to today but the league was different. Slower. People who played against him have said that film study of him makes him look slow until you play him on the court and he has the most deceptive first step in the league. Basically a big bag of tricks put to use in a methodical way. In closing, I like Paul Pierce."
"In 2006, I met Billups at a local mall when all-star weekend was in Houston. He was doing a signing and they had a rule of only one thing could be signed (They provided a free picture of him or you could bring your own item), I brought a card, then stood in line again to a get a picture to give to my cousin and he remembered me.  In 2013, when all-star weekend was in Houston again, I met several more.  Dikembe. My friend and I shouted at him from across the street and he waved at us.  Saw CP3 doing some promo thing for State Farm, and as he was leaving he walked through the middle of the crowd where I happened to be standing. He gave me a fist bump and I told him to sign with the Rockets (he was a free agent to be that summer) He just laughed at me and kept going. I still say I'm the reason he came here, although it was later than 2013.  Saw James Harden walking, he had security surrounding him pushing people out of the way, he was on his way to coach some game against Russell Westbrook.. Celeb game maybe?  Got an autograph from Jrue Holiday. It was his first ASW so he was friendly and having a good time.  LeBron and Kobe were there also but they did their events and dipped out the back immediately after.. Got to see them as they made their exit together.  Also had the chance to meet Karl Malone that night, but fuck the Jazz. I wasn't interested."
"Not to argue either way but the voting wasn’t really close that year. Rose was way ahead, Dwight Howard was second, and then Lebron third. It wasn’t like Rose squeaked ahead like Westbrook vs Harden or Harden vs Giannis. Voters had him as the runaway MVP that year.   1.	Derrick Rose	1182 2.	Dwight Howard	643 3.	LeBron James	522 4.	Kobe Bryant	428 5.	Kevin Durant	190"
"It felt like a way better shot in context. The Spurs laid off James and Wade all game and dared them to shoot midrange jumpers. They made them again and again. This one was really just the culmination of midrange after midrange shot, and so it must've felt really sweet for LeBron to win a finals where he turned hsi biggest weakness into a strength."
"WS/48 is a near perfect indicator of who should have won MVP in a given year. Based on this among players receiving MVP votes in a given year, the following players should have been MVP while Lebron was in the league.  * 2004 - Kevin Garnett * 2005 - Dirk Nowitzki/Kevin Garnett (tie) * 2006 - Dirk Nowitzki * 2007 - Dirk Nowitzki * 2008 - Chris Paul * 2009 - Lebron James * 2010 - Lebron James * 2011 - Lebron James * 2012 - Lebron James * 2013 - Lebron James * 2014 - Kevin Durant * 2015 - Stephen Curry * 2016 - Stephen Curry * 2017 - Kevin Durant (or Kawhi Leonard if you dismiss Durant for missing too many games). * 2018 - James Harden  * 2019 -  Giannis Antekoumpo  Long story short, Lebron probably should have won Rose’s MVP, he was the best player and lost because the Heat were the hyped team and didn’t finish as the 1 seed. There are no other years Lebron should really hold claim to, although he had some solid second place finishes.  James Harden, another guy people whine about not winning multiple MVP only really deserved it the one year. Westbrook shouldn’t have won his, but Kawhi probably should have won that one for leading a 60+ win Spurs team.  Dirk got jobbed by Nash harder than any other player has gotten jobbed for MVPs, and Chris Paul lost out on his MVP to the Kobe Bryant career achievement award."
"Magic Johnson (1979-1991,1996)  Michael Jordan (1984-2003)  LeBron James (2003-Present)  Dirk Nowitzki (1998-2019)  Shaquille O’Neal (1992-2011)"
PG:LeBron James  SG:Michael Jordan  SF:Larry Bird  PF:Tim Duncan  C:Bill Russell   Yeah I’m playing LeBron at point. This my goat squad.
"It’s just so understated what he did for those early 2000s Celtics. Literally carried the franchise on his back and delivered for us when it mattered, each and every time. It really bothers me when people slander him, he out dueled lebron James, Kobe Bryant, you name it on multiple occasions when it mattered the most. Not say he’s better than those two caliber of players, but the fact that he’s intertwined in their careers in a significant way is telling. It’s a tell tale sign you weren’t watching basketball if you speak poorly of him (not his takes as a tv personality) to anyone who was around to watch back then. Dude was the truth for a reason."
LeBron James was a really good receiver in high school IIRC. Who knows how well it would translate to the NFL.
"Lebron James has access to some of the best personal trainers in the world. He spends literally millions on maintaining his body. He can likely call his PT at 3:00 AM and the PT picks up on the first ring with in-depth answers to whatever Lebron wants to ask. Without knowing details on form, I trust the professionals he’s surrounded himself with rather than your opinion. He is literally one of the top athletes in **the entire world** and has very famously been durable during a nearly two-decade term in an incredibly physical sport. I think he knows more than you and I think his trainers definitely know more than you."
"I do think his absolute, full blown, passed every skill check peak is LeBron with more defense. He was compared to LeBron James coming into the draft, with the caveat being his absolute lack of shooting. It's not like I'm saying Anthony Bennet's absolute peak was Larry Johnson (which was a comparison some weirdos were making), but this is a comparison many were making at the time. I don't think it's ridiculous to say ""Ben Simmons absolute full blown peak if everything goes right for him performance is one of his draft comparisons but with his best skill being better""."
"&gt;Simmons is shooting better from 2 than Bron was  because he's more selective with his shots, and being assisted on a higher portion of his shots (29% for LeBron, 50% for Simmons). Simmons obv doesn't have the ability to lead the league in scoring like 3rd year James."
An obviously old video where Skip and Stephen A Smith debate whether or not LeBron James is going to be a Hall of Famer. It feels pretty weird watching this in 2020 after seeing how his career turned out.
[HD FULL VIDEO LeBron James Dunked On By Xavier's Sophomore Jordan Crawford](https://youtu.be/ZUw8M90ui9A)
"Man, I think you are delusional. Real life is not an EA sports game, players like Lebron James are so much more than the sum of their specific abilities. And you can't use a highlight reel of Bird to say he was a better passer (no disrespect to Larry Legend). And if you think PEDs are what is increasing players longevity, the rise of career-ending injuries is more rampant than ever. Do you think that KD, Kobe, Klay, and Rose haven't used PEDs but somehow Lebron is the only one that does? On the other way, I would present you to one Karl Malone that was as close as it can gets to Lebron physically and in longevity in the era of Pippen."
"&gt;  he’s jumping straight up   What??!? Watch it again, Biyombo [gathers &amp; jumps](https://i.imgur.com/WMhAhZc.png) from the top of the restricted circle. He [hits James](https://i.imgur.com/SiTVlB3.png) right next to the basket, watch his momentum. If he doesn't hit LeBron he would've landed out of bounds.  How can you watch him and say ""straight up""? I'm really curious. It is simply LeBron dislike?"
"""Man I miss how clutch MJ was"" Jesus fucking Christ, the MJ deep throating on this sub reddit is just sensational! Despite what some of the media try to keep on telling us, LeBron James has hit more and has a better percentage of game winners and late go ahead or game tying shots! There is a reason why when I think of childhood memories it is always sunny outside for some reason, we always look back with rose tinted glasses and think things were so much better than what they actually were."
Scottie Pippen was not close to LeBron James as a player lmao.
"Yeah, I've always found that strange as well. Like, I saw a thing with Jalen Rose talking to Jay Williams and one other guy (forget his name off hand), and he asked, ""Why do you have to downplay LeBron James like this?"" While the guys were literally saying he was in their 2-4 all time behind Jordan.   Like, if you are comparing someone against the GOAT, of COURSE it's going to seem like downplaying. But EVERYONE would agree LeBron &gt; Pippen, but nobody is gonna be like, ""HOW COULD YOU DOWNPLAY PIP LIKE THAT!?!""  It's so bizarre."
"Because Pippen = Lebron James and was a better defender. He just couldn't pick on little guys since the center position is now useless and you have ""centers"" sitting out near the 3 point line half the time. Scottie had people like Hakeem sitting under the rim.  I'm not saying this as a fan of Pippen either. I think he's an jerk and took a long time to mature, but when he arrived he was really, really good. As Rodman said when Pippen was finally able to beat the Pistons he ""got his wings"". He also called him the best player in the league when MJ retired and John Salley said Pippen is the most skilled player ever. The Pistons punked the Bulls until Scottie finally got his head on right."

"Fun Fact: LeBron James has not won a playoff game since May 27 2018, nearly 2 years ago"
"Either way. My point is not that LeBron is more clutch. Its that there's literally no evidence to suggest Jordan is more clutch. ""Mentality"" is just a bunch of bullshit. James wants to win just as bad as MJ did. LeBron just didn't let that get in the way of his belief that the smartest basketball play is always the best one. The Warriors were better suited defensively to stop a Bron iso than a Kyrie iso, at least in Bron's opinion, so he gave Kyrie the iso opportunity on Steph. I'd take Kyrie guarded by Steph over Bron guarded by Iggy, Draymond, or Klay every day of the week"
"I hate to say it, but I think people just don’t marvel at these things enough because of Lebron James. Every week or so, the guy breaks a new record, or passes someone on an all-time list. People just aren’t impressed by greatness as much at the moment. It’s a shame."
LeBron James
"I mean, it makes sense that he would “cover his tracks” by being nice while having his camp spread this stuff. Then, if accused, LeBron can say he doesn’t control Maverick or Dahntay or whoever.   I’m not even accusing LeBron myself, but just because he said something nice about Curry to the media doesn’t mean he didn’t do it, that’s just naive thinking. Of course he won’t publicly bash Curry, he’s LeBron James."
"I'm a bball strength coach that's worked with multiple abroad and gleague guys and train kids at the D1 college level for a living....  I will be the first to tell you that whatever LeBron James is doing, is working and therefore he should be doing it. I'm not sure I agree with Jeff's video I don't even know if I'd quantify this as a quarter squat and the exercise is basically trying to load him into more than the frontal plane and there's just so many mechanically funny things going on but really, who cares!! Dude's the best player in the world. He and his trainer figured out a system and that should be good enough for everyone lol  No exercise is bad exercise. If someone outright says something is bad they are ignoring the context of the situation in which this exercise is done. And if you ignore the context you basically have no idea what the bigger picture is. Which probably means you have no idea what you're talking about. My 2 cents. Sorry I went on a rant lol"

I think the way to answer this question would be to see who he would kick out of the top 10 all time list. (My top 10 might not be your top-10)  1. Michael Jordan - still better 2.

"Who I'd award MVP by season since Jordan:  2019-20: 1st Giannis, 2nd LeBron, 3rd Harden  2018-19: James Harden (actually Giannis)  2017-18: LeBron James (actually James Harden)  2016-17: James Harden (actually Russell Westbrook)  2015-16: Stephen Curry  2014-15: Russell Westbrook (actually Stephen Curry)  2013-14: Kevin Durant  2012-13: Carmelo Anthony (actually LeBron James)  2011-12: LeBron James  2010-11: LeBron James (actually Derrick Rose)  2009-10: LeBron James  2008-09: Kobe Bryant (actually LeBron James)  2007-08: Kobe Bryant  2006-07: Kobe Bryant (actually Dirk Nowitzki)  2005-06: Kobe Bryant (actually Steve Nash)  2004-05: Allen Iverson (actually Steve Nash)  2003-04: Tracy McGrady (actually Kevin Garnett)  2002-03: Kobe Bryant (actually Tim Duncan)  2001-02: Shaquille O'Neal (actually Tim Duncan)  2000-01: Shaquille O'Neal (actually Allen Iverson)  1999-00: Shaquille O'Neal  1998-99: Shaquille O'Neal (actually Karl Malone)  Bonus: Michael Jordan 1996-97 (actually Karl Malone)"
"That’s cool but it’s not the same at all. Celtics beat the Sixers pretty easy the year before that and their best player was a rookie Tatum.   And the bucks might look amazing with MVP giannis but they have 0 playoff experience so how are they different? At this point I don’t see the bucks any different than I see the James Harden Rockets great team but I don’t see any playoff success to match the regular season  Nurse also had Kawhi a finals mvp and 2 time dpoy in his prime at 27 who just took a year off to get healthy when the best player Casey had was Lowry or Derozan, plus pascals continued improvement plus landing Marc Gasol another former DPOY I mean they were hardly the same team those 2 changed everything  And it’s impossible for anyone to say the East was strong when in 18 lebron ran by it by himself that cavs team was fucking trash by the playoffs and he went to his 8th finals in a row, if giannis doesn’t improve in the playoffs kd might start doing the same"
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."
I have a feeling they aren’t scared to play Lebron James
Haha it’s so hilarious to me that people on the internet criticized LeBron James’ fitness and exercise technique.
"If you ever feel useless, just remember that there is a guy who's job is to ""spot"" LeBron James squatting 135 pounds."
"Steve Jobs was known for being very smart and a running several of the most successful companies in the world.    Lebron James is known for being the best basketball player since Michael Jordan and a genetic freak with amazing athletic abilities.   Neither is known for being a doctor, physical therapist, or trainer. Neither has an MD, PhD, CSCS, MS, or any other qualifications that would allow them to be considered experts in these areas. Both in theory should be more qualified than the average redditor to think through their decisions about health or performance but in practice that’s almost never true. Expertise is important and neither has it. When people make decisions without expertise, their decisions tend to suck. Hence America and thousands of people dying from coronavirus. Also why Steve Jobs is dead and why we can look at Lebron’s exercise selection and say it’s dogshit."
"people who won with ""nice"" personalities:  -lebron james  -stephen curry  -tim duncan  -dirk (though he ""only"" won one championship)"
"How many fights did Jordan get into ? In that era Lebron would have enforcers on his team just like MJ did.  Put Bill Cartwright, Dennis Rodman and Lebron James on your frontline and ask yourself who is gonna fight that team. Lmao"
"They won 3 of 4 titles over a team that tanked and lucked into 5 top 5 picks in 4 years, 3 of those being the first pick, and LeBron James. 3 of 4 is pretty good."
The one and Only reason i even loved basketball in the first place is LEBRON JAMES.   I love the guy so much you can call me a Lebron bandwagon everywhere he goes i go
"Ive been doing Starting Strength for 3 months and I’m a mod on /r/fitness, somebody get me in touch with LeBron James so I can criticize his depth and form"
"Wow this should be higher. ""Even if your name is LeBron James Internet will not give you a pass"""
"&gt;Bron doesn't get a pass for much, someone shits on his life/legacy every time he sneezes  i disagree, I dont think any other athlete in modern professional sports history has ever gotten the ""his opponents were better than him"" pass except Lebron.

"stop circlejerking lmao you are gonna tell me those guys are better than Stephen Curry, LeBron James, James Harden, Russel Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard  we are not talking about their careers just in terms of playing the game and athleticism its not even close no disrespect to those guys.  Gary Payton would be nowhere near the Top 10 of the 2010s you have got to be joking  Barkley would be nowhere near a Top 5 player today, his skillset doesnt fit the era at all and unless you are some athletic freak like giannis or a nearly 7 ft pointguard like ben simmons you are going nowhere with a weak jumper"
LeBron James Is left-handed.
"He’s a diva without the looks. Draymond is a very solid player and he’s seems to be pretty smart too, however he craves attention like a Lebron James but without the charisma, history or numbers to back it up. It is what it is, it’s already caught up to him let’s see how it plays out in the future"
Lebron James
Bold of you to assume LeBron hasn’t unlocked his Final Form. The LeBron “Magic” James era has just begun.
"&gt;I agree but individuals still matter. Even if you have 1 poor defender surrounded by 4 good defenders you can still scheme to abuse that 1 defender even tho he's surrounded by great players.   If you have the shooting to do so, yes. The Lakers don't really. Their two centers can't shoot, and while they they likely play AD at center, he's not someone that's going to burn you most of the time. You can definitely play help off a lot of their guys. They have a lot of medicore to below average shooters, and like 2 good ones (one of whom you don't really wanna play in Daniels)  That's the whole reason Houston went small - so that you can find the mismatch, but then no one can help you. You can always help against the Lakers.  &gt;Maybe I need to watch more Collins on the perimeter because I didn't think that was something you wanted to live with. I think the issue isn't switching a big onto Lebron, it's Lebron turning the corner from a PnR and your defense having to decide between protecting the rim or collapsing and leaving shooters open. I'd be scared of them from any teams perspective.  You should man. He's really good at it. Dude was straight locking up from everywhere from what we saw this year. He could be special in that regard. Just wish he had played more games. [Obviously small sample size alert cause he got hurt in game 3](https://stats.nba.com/players/defense-dash-overall/?sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*10&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season), but he defended shots everywhere on the court and shut it down.  Lebron is Lebron, and sometimes he's gonna get his. Just how it goes. But there isn't a team in the league with better rim protection from their 4/5 than Collins and Nurkic, and that's not a bad start. I'll live with forcing mediocre lakers shooters beat us on late closeouts.  &gt;As a Portland fan who suffered an embarrassing sweep that nobody predicted  What do you mean nobody predicted it? What nobody predicted was us making it out of the first round after Nurkic went down lol. Instead we made the WCF  Besides, that's about as close as a sweep physically can be against a team that's always had our number. And we were just dead man.  Lillard separated his ribs in game 2, Nurkic was already out, and Kanter had a separated shoulder. Plus both he and Aminu were fasting for ramadan. And when our star gets hurt, we don't have a backup MVP and 2 all stars to rely on lol.  Why *should* I be scared of the Nuggets? They're the same team as last year - arguably worse actually. They're winning the same percentage of games but with a worse net rating.  If we can beat them *without* our 2nd best player and while putting the literal worst defensive center in the entire league on Jokic **while he has a separated shoulder** and win without HCA....what is scary about that?  &gt;Rockets are a lot better than you're making them out to be. Teams can literally not stop James Harden and that 5 out was working against larger teams too. Rebounds on the glass isn't the issue, they're looking to outscore you and push the pace to where Nurkic gets played off the floor. I'm not saying I can't see Portland beating any of those 3 but you're all in the same tier at least below the LA teams. Rockets have gotten closer to the finals than any of the Dame years. Didn't you lose to the Nuggets 3/3 times this season and 3/4 times last season before going to a game 7 with them? I know you like your team but most people view the Trailblazers right with the Rockets, Nuggets, Jazz.  We're definitely in the same tier as them. I'd just argue we're the best of the group - certainly better than the Jazz and the Nuggets, who haven't proven anything. The Rockets were better before they traded Capela and CP3. CP3 is flat out better than Russ, especially in the playoffs.  It also just wasn't working man. It worked against the Lakers in one aberrant game where they managed to stay afloat on the glass, but then they got murdered from then on.  Their ORTG and DRTG were both worse, they were 8-6 with losses to bad teams, and they didn't beat a single team after that Lakers game that had an above average big man.  They were the worst defensive rebounding team in the entire league during that span. Shit just won't work long term. It was viable for a few games before people figured it out and their wings got flat out beat up, injured, and fatigued guarding centers night after night."
"For me the villains are whatever team Lebron James is on. The man is one of the greatest of all time, but for some reason I like cheering against him. It’s probably post-traumatic stress from lebronto."
"I'm reading the comments and come on people LeBron James is probably up until this point the greatest athlete the league has seen.  There is no player at his size,speed, and strength that was around in 90s. He would have been a nightmare he can do it all at 6 ft 9 and 265. If he was dropped into the 90s and he plays the 1 who is guarding him."
"&gt;1v1 defense just isn't that important anymore. It's all about scheme and having good rim protection.  I agree but individuals still matter. Even if you have 1 poor defender surrounded by 4 good defenders you can still scheme to abuse that 1 defender even tho he's surrounded by great players. Offenses can scheme against those matchups just as much as defenses can scheme around their weaknesses.  &gt;Why would we ever switch against the Lakers though? They don't have shooting like that. There's no reason to switch a big onto Lebron against the Lakers.  Maybe I need to watch more Collins on the perimeter because I didn't think that was something you wanted to live with. I think the issue isn't switching a big onto Lebron, it's Lebron turning the corner from a PnR and your defense having to decide between protecting the rim or collapsing and leaving shooters open. I'd be scared of them from any teams perspective.  &gt;They're straight pretenders built for the regular season. Same with the Jazz.   &gt; Rockets really aren't scary with their no big man lineup.  You start to lose me here. As a Portland fan who suffered an embarrassing sweep that nobody predicted, it's odd to hear all these predictions with such certainty. Nuggets have a unique passing bigman with a good coach and a quality surrounding cast who is only getting better each year. Jokic just turned 25. Jazz I'm less sold on but still Mitchel is mad young and their defense can cause real problems when schemed the right way.  Rockets are a lot better than you're making them out to be. Teams can literally not stop James Harden and that 5 out was working against larger teams too. Rebounds on the glass isn't the issue, they're looking to outscore you and push the pace to where Nurkic gets played off the floor. I'm not saying I can't see Portland beating any of those 3 but you're all in the same tier *at least* below the LA teams. Rockets have gotten closer to the finals than any of the Dame years. Didn't you lose to the Nuggets 3/3 times this season and 3/4 times last season before going to a game 7 with them? I know you like your team but most people view the Trailblazers right with the Rockets, Nuggets, Jazz."
LeBron James?
"Shaun Livingston is so good that he got waived immediately after and retired. Is this how Raptors fans cope with getting swept by an awful Cavs team in 2018? Derrick Rose, Lebron James, Kyle Korver, Kevin Love, George Hill, Jose Calderon. Just ignore all context and pretend you faced prime Derrick Rose and Jose Calderon lmao."
Imagine how different Rich Paul’s life would be if he wasn’t friends with LeBron James. He was selling jerseys out of the car of his trunk in the early 2000s and now he's representing some of the most famous athletes in the world
"Lebron really needed a better eye for situations.  If he took the crew to Chicago instead of Miami in 2010, they would have won way more with a supporting cast of Rose, Noah, James Johnson, Taj Gibson, and maybe Jimmy Butler (assuming GarPax is stubborn enough to not trade their pick when Lebron demands it) around Lebron/Wade/Bosh (assuming they trade Luol Deng to make room for Bosh).  In his 2015 free agency, if he had scouted out the Golden State situation properly, he could have won like 6 straight championships and gotten all the credit for elavating Curry's level of play."
"For one - not every champion wants to spend their offseason in the Olympics. LeBron James and Steph Curry stayed out of the 2016 Olympics to have some time to recover and be with their families.  For another, you won't have a Team USA-level starting 5 unless you run the 2016-18 Warriors. You won't have a Team USA-level bench 10, regardless of what team you are.  Now, if you sent half of both finalists, you could have a pretty ridiculously dominant squad. Just hockey-swap, I suppose?"
Even Al Qaeda members thought that LeBron [should apologize to Cleveland](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/osama-bin-ladens-translator-wanted-lebron-james-to-apologize-to-cleveland/).
"[Ah yes, the LeBron James approach.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3bUb72KzFA#t=0m40s)"
"Idk, the Warriors played multiple game 7s and came desperately close to losing on various  occasions, even WITH Durant.   GSW very clearly needed an efficient isolation scorer in the last few runs which KD did to the tune of ~30ppg and went head-to-head with Lebron James in the Finals. They can fill in with role players here and there, but you can't just replace the impact of an all-time great like Durant."
"Why couldn't a prime Karl Malone guard a 35 year old Lebron James?  They have comparable size and power, but Malone would have a distinct athletic advantage.  And Pippen is one of the greatest wing defenders of all-time.  It's stupid to think that he could make it difficult for Durant?  Why?    And that's not even considering the fact that Durant tore his achilles."
"Gonna be tough. They have no depth, no cap space to add depth, their core will all be over 30 years old with all having injury history, and they're playing in a conference with LeBron James. They're also relying on their draft pick to add some meaningful production.   I think they'll be a good team, around 45-48 wins, but I think their championship window is closed."
"Other than the Mavs They were never favorites? IIRC OKC was favorites and the spurs were the favorites both times. The heat was Lebron James with an aging D wade and a Chris Bosh who was 3rd fiddle. They had no bench they had no role players they were an awful team. Teams are not just how many allstars you can stack up. A good example is the GSW if Draymond was on almost any other team do you think he's an allstar? No, fit is extremely important."
"This ""Lebron James doesn't have a Killer Instinct"" trope is ridiculous.  Coming back 3-1 is as Killer Instinct as it gets it.  Scoring the last 25 points against the Pistons is Killer Instinct.  45 points against the Celtics is Killer Instinct."
Uhh... LeBron James created a version of 15-16 Warriors. And Durant joined them. This is pretty simple.
"LeBron James didn't lose any finals because of hero ball. That's fucking ridicilous. They lost in 2007 because the spurs were much better. They lost in 2011 because LeBron disappeared. They lost in 2014 because the Spurs were draining 3's and playing good defense. They lost in 2015 because the Warriors were the better team. LeBron is not going to beat the Warriors by playing ""team ball"" with players like Mosgov and Delly. They would lose regardless. They lost in 2017 because Golden State was a Juggernaut. Nothing would have changed that. And again, they lost in 2018 because they were outmatched.  None of these losses are attributed to hero ball. If you think they are, you don't watch basketball"
"&gt;There is no rules and definition to the term  I didn't say there were. I'm just saying your criteria/measurement is kinda silly because there are wack players on every team even the superteams and even the best teams ever  &gt;Personally I dont see how a team can be called ""Super"" yet its questionable if they are even good  It's questionable that a team featuring prime LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh is good? Are you ok?   &gt;Clearly you can throw three superstars together and struggle to get to 50 wins so how is that a ""Super"" team?   They won 58 games that year tho, and that was with a bad start due to poor chemistry and the immense hype and expectations they had to deal with"
"Warrior fans did. Basketball heads didn't think Curry was better than LeBron James.  Shit even in 2015, LeBron came in 2nd for FMVP on the losing team because he was clearly the best player in the series."
"Option A  LeBron James tells the Cavs “I don’t like Steph Curry. So instead of increasing our chances of winning a championship, we’re going to not double Steph Curry at all. It’s more important than another ring.  Option B  Tyron Lue is a bad coach"
"if i were a little kid trapped near a *drunken, abusive lunatic* like lebron james i most certainly would be"
"why are you so callously overlooking the incontrovertible proof of child abuse before your very eyes? are you a proponent of harming innocent children?  the only killer instinct from we're seeing from lebron 'babykiller' james is towards children's livers  and you are loving it, apparently..."
"since you're using two random articles claiming two unverifiable instances as fact that jordan is an alcoholic, let's add a few more &amp; call child protective services on lebron while we're at it  at least jordan didn't endanger his own children!  https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/10/10/lebron-james-says-he-shares-wine-with-his-sons-ages/  https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/lakers/2018/10/10/madd-responds-lebron-james-remarks-his-kids-drinking-wine/1592504002/  https://www.americasrehabcampuses.com/blog/is-nba-superstar-lebron-james-putting-his-underaged-children-at-risk-for-alcohol-addiction/"
"&gt; ""It's always an ongoing argument about who is the GOAT. Michael obviously is up there and is the greatest of all time,"" Malone said Tuesday in a Zoom call with reporters. ""There are not many Michael Jordans out there. I coached LeBron James for five years and have a great relationship with him. LeBron did not have the same mindset or killer mentality that Michael Jordan is supposed to have had. But LeBron James is arguably the greatest of all time as well.""  &gt; ""Michael Jordan was not just a great player. He would reach into your chest and pull your heart out if he had to win a game,"" Malone said. ""You don’t see that really often. He had that killer mindset and brought it every single night. That’s why all of these many years later, he’s the greatest of all time."""
For real. I can MAYBE let the Big O at #1 slide.  But KYRIE IRVING over LEBRON JAMES  Kyrie isnt even the best PG in the league!!!
"Lol I know what you mean. I'm not one of those guys but i know guys who go to the barbershop every single week just for a line up or to keep it looking the exact same. I was getting a cut like once a month because I'm not trying to have haircuts become a bill. That's at least $80 a month in cuts. Too much for me. Some guys have a lot of facial hair and go for that reason too. Also, black hair comes in all different grades of coarseness, curlyness, wavyness, thickness, etc. Luckily I have a grade of hair that looks good for a while even when it gets longer. Some guys have the [Kevin Durant](https://mobile.twitter.com/jordanheckff/status/981963256125419520) or the [Lebron James](https://www.google.com/search?q=lebron+james+hair&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiy8JfCj__oAhVGtFMKHQ4vCmoQ2-cCegQIABAC&amp;oq=lebron+james+hair&amp;gs_lcp=ChJtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1pbWcQAzICCAAyAggAMgUIABDNAjoHCCMQ6gIQJzoECCMQJzoECAAQQ1CDH1jFW2ChXmgHcAB4AYAB-AWIAekzkgENMC43LjIuMi4wLjUuMpgBAKABAbABBQ&amp;sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-img&amp;ei=1NahXrK2BsbozgKO3qjQBg&amp;bih=718&amp;biw=412&amp;client=ms-android-samsung-ss&amp;prmd=insv) shit going on and need to get cut often to look clean."
LeBron James
"The Celtics front office didnt screw him over in any way. He got traded to LEBRON JAMES, not the fucking Knicks."
I think that's in large part because LeBron had at least a week to actually craft a well-thought out response and in doing so willing to chose to depart from his own values whereas James Harden wasnt afforded that luxury.
But I’m not comparing the two in terms of better or worse or more arrogant (or how ppl perceive lebron which is mostly what it’s about). I never did that. You’re doing that. The other guy is doing that. Now it’s clear it’s more about preconceived biases and other things. Kinda like the other commenter was calling out OP for. I remember originally saying “it’s ok” to do that. I’m not that concerned with what’s arrogant or not. Lol it’s Kobe Bryant and Lebron James. How do you think these guys see themselves? It’s totally understandable.
"First, you cut off yourself when you wrote that LBJ is No. 1.      He can't be No. 1 in any case.     My list:  &amp;#x200B;  1. Michael Jordan 2. Kobe Bryant (5-7 NBA Finals, more pts than Magic, better finals record) 3. Magic Johnson 4. LeBron James 5. Larry Bird 6. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 7. Bill Russell 8. Shaq O'Neal 9. Wilt Chamberlain 10. Tim Duncan 11. Hakeem Olajuwon 12. Oscar Robertson 13. Jerry West 14. Kevin Durant 15. Kevin Garnett"
"Hot take: What Lebron James did isn't really any worse than what millions of Americans do every day.We all know China is terrible, abuses human rights, ethnic cleansing but we all still buy products from them. Americans say they're Anti-China but buy a new iPhone and Nike Shoes the moment they get their stimulus check.  We vote for politicians that create ""free"" trade policies that heavily favor China, increase their GDP, and ability to crack down on human rights. We look the other way when Disney, big video game companies and Nike pander to China, but we're going to slander Lebron for what he said? Let's not hold LBJ to a standard we wouldn't hold ourselves to"
China owns LeBron James soul.
"Here’s what I think.  If you had an all time draft there are only 3 players who would get consideration for #1 pick.  Michael Jordan - Lebron James - and Shaq.  Shaq is the only player with an argument outside of those two for the top spot because of his sheer dominance. With Shaq you are absolutely going to win a ring at some point in his prime, there’s no question about it."
Jordan can defend Lebron james.
I still think Jayson Tatum had one of the best playoff runs by a rookie and what that 2017-18 Celtics team accomplished when both of their agreed upon best players were injured was amazing. Beat teams led by a upstart Giannis and Embiid and took a highly favored Lebron James team to 7 games.
Not including any players who peaked before the 3pt era.  1. Michael Jordan  2. Magic Johnson  3. Larry Bird  4. Shaquille O'Neal  5. LeBron James  6. Hakeem Olajuwon  7. Tim Duncan  8. Kobe Bryant  9. Kevin Durant   9. Moses Malone  10. David Robinson  11. Stephen Curry  12. Kevin Garnett  13. Dwyane Wade   14. Charles Barkley
"1. Bill Russell 2. Wilt Chamberlain 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. LeBron James 5. Michael Jordan 6. Hakeem Olajuwon 7. Tim Duncan 8. Larry Bird 9. Magic Johnson 10. Shaquille O'Neal 11. Kevin Garnett 12. Oscar Robertson 13. Jerry West 14. Kobe Bryant 15. Stephen Curry  A lot of times I prefer putting players in ranges, but I'll put this as a general ranking for now."
"I remember when LeBron had that legendary Game 5 against Detroit Jordan commented that it was a very important moment for the NBA or something to that effect.  EDIT: Here’s the quote:   ""What just transpired was something I felt was needed for the league, was needed for Cleveland, was needed for LeBron. Making 'The Leap' is where you do it every single night. It's expected of you, and you do it. ... Not one game, not two games. It's consistent. Every defense comes in and they focus on you and you still impact the game. I think he's shown signs of that."" -- Michael Jordan June 4, 2007 (Source: Chicago Tribune)  From this very interesting article filled with quotes of LeBron and Jordan talking about one another:   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/allstarweekend25788027/the-comparison-lebron-james-michael-jordan-their-own-words"
The Cavs once developed a kid named Lebron James.
"You see now you are comparing him to a classic jock.   Okay I guess this is how I’ll make my point.   Let’s say someone says and I have heard this before   “ It’s not about race. If I saw a big white guy with tattoos, piercings, and sagging pants I’d cross the street too. While a Black guy with a suit wouldn’t bother me”    Do you see the issue?   We are now adding qualifiers to white. Which include “big”, “tattoos”, and “sagging pants” and comparing it to Black with a suit.   Gronk is your classic jock. Why are you using him as your comparison? Does Lebron act like Gronk? No he does not. So why are we comparing Lebron to classic jocks?   Nobody says Steve Kerr is articulate. Because he hasn’t shown us anything that says otherwise. Nobody says Tom Brady is articulate and there is zero examples shown so far.    Just to prove my point.   I googled “ Lebron James articulate”   “ LeBron James introduces new ways through his will to win through his team first mentality. ... replay in his mind and flawlessly articulate to the media a sequence of plays or happenings”    https://www.forbes.com/sites/glennllopis/2018/05/29/4-transformational-things-lebron-james-teaches-us-about-leadership-and-teamwork/   There is multiple articles calling him articulate. Multiple okay not just one.    I find two instances of Tom Brady being called articulate and one of them was his coach. Which honestly shouldn’t even count.    https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/721877-tom-brady-and-5-post-career-job-possibilities.amp.html"
Lebron James - The Facemask Game.
[There was also that time in Cleveland...](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14190871/lebron-james-apologizes-erroneous-substitution-results-technical-foul-cleveland-cavaliers).
"Lmao that is some of the most disrespectful shit I've ever heard. I guess we don't give any credit to the way Dallas plays when they beat LeBron James in a series, he just let them win. Got it."
"well that’s the point isn’t it? the stereotype of both black people and pro athletes points away from being articulate, which is why someone who doesn’t check those stereotypes would be surprised at seeing lebron james speak"
Kyrie's only history of winning is with LeBron James on his team. Are we really giving Kyrie credit for that when Bron went to the Finals after the Cavs lost Kyrie in a  trade for absolutely nothing? Kyrie's Cavs were allergic to winning before Bron came back
"The excuses never change. Jordan neither had a prime Wade or Bosh at his side against the Pistons. And he did not collapse in any of his 6 finals years. Especially not with 8 points. EIGHT.  Hence the GOAT tag.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/727670-2011-nba-finals-is-lebron-james-choking-away-chance-at-ring-vs-mavericks  Lebron would have been in a GOAT debate if he came back from this, MJ like. He did not and lost the series."
"Just pointing out stuff. Not looking to argue. No judgments on whether who is better.  The assertions of people who say that Jordan never proclaimed himself the GOAT are a reaction to LeBron's own proclamation. It stands to reason that the manner by which James proclaimed himself to be the GOAT is a factor. IMO, understandably so.  There is a difference. Mileage may vary as to just *how* different. For me, based on this video, I've seen no evidence that Jordan self-proclaimed his GOAT-ness for the general public the LeBron has.   It's a silly argument anyway. Same with Wilt vs MJ. Different positions, different eras."
"""#2's not a great player because he left my Spurs and I think Jason Terry is better than LeBron James because Bron choked in 2011 Finals. My Spurs never choked in any Finals ever!!"" -Skip"
"Strength is a part of athleticism, but in the NBA it's usually speed and jumping ability that are the first things people would use to judge athletic ability. You combine those attributes with size and strength, then you get freaks like Lebron James."
"I dunno. I'm pretty old. I think LeBron James has a case as being the greatest player, and his story isn't yet complete. He has the accolades, the longevity, the health, the fame. And his story is amazing. Growing up in Cleveland, getting drafted there, learning how to win in Miami, then actually going BACK to Cleveland to accomplish a goal that he's probably dreamed of his whole life. Who can say they were that laser focused? Who can say they were so self aware that they turned themselves in to a villain for a time in order to reach their ultimate goal?  Now he's in the midst of another unfathomable challenge, bringing the Lakers back to glory.  Jordan wanted to win. LeBron seems like he wants to do it against all odds. He wants all the pressure, all of it, not just on the court. The media, the optics, the consequences of failure. And so far he's been successful.  We're all in a Last Dance afterglow right now. But let's see what LeBron has in store for his last act."
I’m sorry but this notion that LeBron James is not a Killer has to stop. You don’t accomplish Game 6 at Boston if you’re not a killer. You don’t have the courage and will to stay in the series and come back 3-1 if your not a killer. All of which happened admittedly after his shortcoming in 2011 championship. Saying he’s not a killer is just unfounded disrespect at this point. Same can be said for those who believe Wilt was a “loser” when he did win twice.
"The Rockets whole MO that off-season was building a team catered to Hardens strengths after the Dwightmare .500 season. They questionably threw a max bag at the duo of Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson just to get this done.  PatBev, Ariza, Eric Gordon, and Ryan Anderson are all immediately by leaps and bounds the best shooter OKC would have in the top of their rotation.  Westbrook  Oladipo Roberson Taj Gibson  Steven Adams  The fact that this starting lineup made the playoffs in this era of basketball is mind boggling. This an assortment of good looking names not a well constructed basketball team. Oladipo who was at best average as a shooter at the time is the only person in this lineup capable of knocking down jumpers.   We just watched LeBron James miss the playoffs largely due to the same problem. A slashing playmaker needs shooting around him to be successful.  Compared to   Beverly Harden Ariza Anderson (pretty sure tucker came with CP3) Capela  Not world beaters by any stretch but any credible basketball analysis will tell you which of these lineups will be more successful. One is actually put together in a way that the players compliment each other, outside Anderson’s horrific defense everyone has a clear role on both sides of the ball to assist the team.  As for the analysts being low on the team, Capela hadn’t proven he was capable of taking on Dwights role even tho Howard had been toxic, Capela’s conditioning was still a major concern. Also Harden the point guard was not viewed as something that would work the way it did at the time, people had not fully embraced position-less basketball conceptually yet and just said James Harden can’t be Steve Nash he’s a scorer."

He's only likeable when on historically bad franchises like the Cavs. But just lol @ thinking LeBron James is an underdog
"[Lebron James](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html) actually has a better eFG% than [Michael Jordan](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html)   Statistically, Lebron beats Mike in almost every category outside of PPG."
cause he is overrated as fuck and has a POS fanbase. RIp to Kobe and people opinions but I’m done playing nice when it lanclear NBa fans are still assholes to certain players (Lebron) so I will answer back. I’m sick of this fanbase making him like a GOD. Most cheesiest guy ever with the unoriginal mana mentality and would be James Harden if he wa Denver a Laker. He is overrated. I’m sick of this fanbase making him like a GOD. How could you be the GOaT and even this top five player if you were never heads above everyone. If TV is guy had three rings no on would even consider this guy top five. He benefits so much from playing in La and his corny personality. I’m sorry great player but I’m not going to bend down to his arrogant fanbase.
You telling me if Rodman went down/got suspended vs the Rockets the Bulls wouldn’t have dropped some games?  Draymond and Bogut missed games. Against Lebron fricking James and Kyrie Irving. Rim protection matters
"Better scorer, Better passer, LeBron played with much worse players in Cleveland than Kareem did in Milwaukee and still dragged his team kicking and screaming to the finals, Kareem played in an era with pretty a pretty shallow talent pool at center, LeBron's competition for championships were comparable to, if not better, than Kareem's and Bron never played with another top 10/arguable top 10 player ever while Kareem played with two.  LeBron James checks pretty much every single category that make up Kareem's case: Longevity, dominant scoring and defense. But he also extends it a bit farther by being one of the best passers in the league and being much more flexible with his playstyle, adapting to his aging body and changing league more gracefully than Kareem did, which to me is a sign of being a great player."
Was trying to compare career stats with todays players vs the 90's era....was surprised that LeBron James stats almost resembles Karl Malone stats...  Karl Malone with the 2nd most points in NBA history and played with the best point guard in the 90's era was not able to beat Jordan in the finals...  Makes me appreciate Jordan and his stats even more and Michael did it consistently every year.....
"Nobody should be mad about this. Idk how people don’t realize this already: The majority of superstars think they’re the best player ever, they just don’t have the same accomplishments so they don’t say it   Kevin Durant definitely feels he’s the greatest player ever. He’s 7 foot and scores over everybody, how could he not? He only lost in OKC because there was no spacing, what happened in Golden State? GOAT team and GOAT numbers for him. In his mind he’s thinking if you swapped him for MJ in those series then he would do the same thing or better   Harden brought the Steph-KD warriors to 7 games and has all time statistical seasons, he legitimately thinks he’s the first and only guy to ever be doubled at half court. In his mind he only hasn’t won because he didn’t have enough talent yet and right when he got it with CP3 the warriors had to make a super team to beat him. He’s got Daryl Morey making spreadsheets telling him 800 different ways he’s better than MJ. Dude definitely thinks he’s the goat and could’ve done the same stuff as MJ on those teams   Steph literally changed the game and had every team trying to catch up to him. He’s making shots nobody in NBA history ever has. He wins a championship. Next year gets hurt in the playoffs and loses, so he’s thinking “we went up 3-1 with me hurt, imagine me healthy”. They get KD, and he’s watching the film for every game and seeing guys are still doubling him over KD. KDs numbers were the ones that changed, not Steph’s. 2019 his whole team dies and he’s still out here dropping 47, the Raptors pull out a middle school defense tactic that never gets played in the NBA just to stop him. He loses but he’s got G league teammates. Dudes the first unanimous MVP, you really think he thinks someone else is better than him?   Kawhi doesn’t say anything, but he won finals MVP and beat the heatles. He wins 2 DPOYs. He moves on from the best org and best coach in the league, spends a year in Toronto and still wins a championship while making sure he doesn’t get hurt and mess up the payday. You really think he looks at other guys and thinks he’s worse than them?   Kobe has said before that he thinks he’s the best player ever, he’ll always show respect to Jordan because of the 6 rings and accomplishments and the fact that he was a mentor to him, but Kobe for sure thinks that if he was put on those bulls teams they still win 6, or 8 because he wouldn’t have played baseball. Dude even said he was the best over Jordan and Lebron on James Corden (was in a comedy situation but you know he means it) How could Kobe dedicate his life to basketball, reach the highs he did, and not think he’s the best ever? He had an entire new generation telling him he was too   Shaq swept MJ, who was putting up MJ numbers even if he only just came back. The next year they lost but because that team fell apart around him. Then he went on to be the best player on one of the 3 best teams ever. You think with his resume he thinks MJ was better than him?   The only truly humble superstars that I’ve heard are Bird, Iverson, Magic, and Nash. They all go out of their way to praise the next generation and say that guys are better than them   Do you know how many non stars think they’re the great? On the Heatles Mario Chalmer just thought the big 3 were taking shots away from him. Raymond Felton said multiple times that he was the best point guard in the league. Spencer Dinwiddie thinks he’s as athletic as MJ  NBA players are the most confident guys in the world and all of them at the top think they’re the best, and the only reason they’re not considered the best is because other guys are in better situations. And you can’t really blame them. The only reason MJ can say he’s the goat and nobody will get mad is because he’s got the best resume for it right now. If Luka averages 30/10/10 for his whole career and wins 20 rings, you think MJ is saying that he’s the new goat? No way, he’s saying “If I played today I’d average 60/20/20 and never lose a game”"
And then JJ Barea sonned Lebron James
"While you are correct that one player has a higher percentage than the other, neither are 3pt specialists.  You would compare Tim Legler and Kyle Kover in 3pt percentages.  Steph Curry verse Reggie Miller.   Is Rashard Lewis better than Lebron James?"
I actually think Michael Jordan was a better basketball player than LeBron James. I still don’t see the need to build up MJ at the expense of LBJ.

Players selected because they played most of their peak in that particular decade.     Kobe Bryant's peak was mostly in the 2000s, and only played 6 seasons in the 2010s so I omitted him from the discussion. He belongs in the 2000s best SG group.  &amp;#x200B;  Dwyane Wade individually peaked more in the 2000s but won 2 of his 3 championships in the 2010s."
"I don’t really know why you think you need to call people morons but he really is and I don’t really understand how you can say “MJ is clearly the goat” in one sentence and then say your am idiot if you think Lebron a full tier below. What does CLEARLY THE GOAT mean?   Lebron James has PERSONALLY been BAD, in two NBA finals. He’s a tremendous player but when comparing someone to Mike that’s already more than enough to lose the argument. I’m not making the 6-0 argument, that’s a dumb argument. I’m making the Lebron has a finals appearance where he shot 35% from the field and a finals appearance where he average less than 18 points a game argument."
"Steve Nash is for sure, a top 5 or top 10 point guard, but a lot of people don’t think about the era certain MVPs played in. It was probably a good PR move to award an agreeable, consistent and team-player like Nash. The mid-00s were a ballhog-led, antagonistic, disloyal, and effort-selective era in the NBA. That whole rumor mill about the best players only trying in the playoffs was mostly true.  But I also got to watch Steve Nash play during this MVP era, against a young and brutal Chicago Bulls, and despite the Suns having a pretty off-night, Nash was wiping the floor with them. I remember him grabbing rebounds left &amp; right(something he wasn’t really known for.)  In the NBA some players’ legends precede them; even if you’ve never payed much attention to Lebron James, you know he’s arguably the best basketball player in the world.  Then there’s guys like Steve Nash, Russell Westbrook or David Robinson, who weren’t the most famous names or even the ones topping the points column. But if you watched these guys during their MVP seasons, you knew they deserved the award."
"Imagine lebron ""Pussyfootin'™"" james not sexually assaulting Dremond Green with his dick and balls..."
"For sure thats why Shaq isn't in the GOAT debate. During his Laker stint and onwards he was known to rehab during the regular season, but once he turned it on for the playoffs he was the MAN. To me, the reason his peak was so good is that he shifted the meta towards him. Teams were drafting and paying complete scrubs to attempt to guard him (Eddy Curry, Jerome James, etc.) It was a weird time where the other dominant big was Duncan, whom dominated subtlety, and Yao, whom really hit his stide in 04.    Wow dont know who Rod Laver is, but I might go check out some videos. Thanks for the heads up. I feel like in all sports the GOATS are from the new generation due to technology, training, nutrition, analytics. It can't be just coincidence  that Lebron, Tiger, Brady, Federer, Trout, Messi, Ronaldo, etc. are all acheiving this greatness during the same time frame."
"We believe Warriors into drafting the Big 3, 73-9 run and giving up the first 3-1 series against Lebron James, grabbing KD and constructing one of the most unfair teams of all time? Come on, that doc writes itself."
"When Curry got injured in December,  He gave KD Curry’s normal timeslot.   Durant finished top 2 in MVP voting 3 times to Prime LeBron James in a row....It’s prime LeBron we’re talking about whose eons better than Both Curry and KD."
"Team 1  PG: Gary Payton  SG: Michael Jordan  SF: Scottie Pippen  PF: Kevin Garnett  C: Hakeem Olajuwon  Bench: Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Joakim Noah (circa 2013)    Team 2  PG - Jason Kidd  SG - Kobe Bryant  SF - Lebron James   PF- Tim Duncan   C- David Robinson   Bench: Shawn Marion, Tyson Chandler, Joe Dumars    Just riffing. I know I missed some great defenders."
You could blame the Warriors and Lebron James.
"I think every runner up for mvp has said that they deserve mvp. Harden has just been [runner up](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportingnews.com/us/amp/nba/news/lebron-james-mvp-odds-predictions-cleveland-cavaliers-news/17j2o35iwet4s13bqk8u8z4w1b) more than anybody else in the past 5 years lol. Also the unanimous part wasn’t the reason, harden was no where near contention that year Lebrun wouldda been the clear #2. Not only that how did he complain his way into the 14/15 race??"
"No. His performance speaks for itself and is great, but despite his great seasons, he has a history of complaining about how he deserves the MVP title  [2015](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/james-harden-stephen-curry-mvp-debate/amp)   2016- didn’t complain, but it was literally unanimous  [2017](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/04/10/rockets-james-harden-on-mvp-race-i-thought-winning-was-what-this-is-about/%3FoutputType%3Damp)   2018- he won  [2019](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/amp/league/article/2019/08/21/james-harden-speaks-not-winning-mvp)  Besides the year he won it and the 1 undisputed year of curry, there’s literally hasn’t been a season in the past 5 where he hasn’t questioned why he didn’t win   Edit: I mean there’s no harm in giving props for dudes who are balling out that particular season. And it’s not like he’s not in the discussion, he’s deservedly been in the top 2 or 3 in voting all those years. So it’s not like people don’t give him props, but imagine Lebron, the best player for 2 decades saying he should’ve won it. And I’m not even a Lebron fan. We would’ve flamed him for eternity if every year he just said he got robbed."
PG: Steph Curry (Under Armor)  SG: James Harden (Adidas)  SF: Klay Thompson (Anta)  PF: LeBron James (Nike)  C: Draymond Green (Converse)
"100%.  If he hits that shot instead of Ray Allen it wipes away the stain of the 2011 finals away.  Especially if his and Ray’s roles are reversed. Imagine *Ray Allen* missing a clutch three pointer, Bosh rebounding and then Lebron freakin James making it.  That would have broken the sports world. It would have broken the not clutch narrative and would hamper the narrative/fact that he’s switched teams 3 times, each one to a super team because he made the shot himself."
"Superteams are only good when Lebron James is on them  Otherwise, teams are NOT allowed to improve their team in such fashion. You will be given an asterisk for any championship"
"Flagrant fouls did not exist in the 80s.. if that era was so tough then why would Lebron be ejected for fighting back? They would play on, except Lebron would be at the line shooting FTs and Laimbeer would be picking his teeth off the floor.   Never said anything about Lebron being an ‘enforcer’.. He isn’t going to instigate a fight like an Artest, but by all means he would defend himself (to the extent of whatever the rules allowed). That has nothing to do with enforcing .. its called competing.   Even if Lebron as a star player didn’t have an enforcer mindset , in that era his team would have players who are designated to do that on his behalf. You would have to be a blithering fkn idiot to look across at a team with Bill Cartwright, Charles Oakley, Lebron James on the frontline and say “yeah we’ll try to beat them up , that’ll work!” Lol."
I find it funny how the LeBron James fans on this sub always put the dunk over an old ass Jason Terry onto a pedestal after the Jet had called him out previously. But they conveniently forget that Jason Terry did the same thing during the 2011 finals and LeBron's inability to respond to the verbal challenge is the black mark of his career. They talk as if one dunk made up for the reason the Jordan fans will forever have the easy case when they dismiss LBJ's claim for the title of GOAT.
"That's fair, his numbers especially in the last couple games were downright terrible. To be honest with Kyrie I feel like his body language is always a little off, I just assume regardless of the game and place, he's looking like this:  [Kyrie Face](https://b.fssta.com/uploads/content/dam/fsdigital/fscom/NBA/images/2016/04/01/040116-NBA-LeBron-James-Cleveland-Cavaliers-Kyrie-Irving-3.vresize.1200.630.high.20.jpg)"

"As I wrote in the post, I will definitely show this game soon, but not as the first game since it's a low scoring, nervous wreck of a game. A great game, though, but I think it will mean more after actually knowing who LeBron James is and that the Warriors are an all-time great team."
"YOU KNOW THEY SAY ALL GOATS ARE CREATED EQUAL. BUT YOU LOOK AT MICHAEL JORDAN AND YOU LOOK AT LEBRON JAMES AND YOU CAN SEE THAT STATEMENT IS NOT TRUE! SEE NORMALLY IF LEBRON GO 1 ON 1 WITH ANOTHER GOAT HE GOT A 50/50 CHANCE OF WINNING! BUT MJ IS A GENETIC FREAK AND HE'S NOT NORMAL! SO LEBRON GOT A 25% AT BEST AT BEAT HIM IN GOAT DEBATE! AND THEN YOU ADD MJ'S 6 RINGS TO THE MIX, LEBRON'S CHANCES OF WINNING DRASTIC GO DOWN! SEE THE 2 WAY AT GOAT DEBATE YOU GOT A 33 1/3 CHANCE OF WINNING.

"Splitter winding up, and the strength of LeBron James to stop this and throw it back"
"Westbrook , Klay Thompson, Durant , lebron James, Anthony Davis. I’d love to see Westbrook and Lebron run the floor with 2 of the best shooters ever and Davis who is one of the best shooting big men. I wanted to include Dirk but Westbrook needs the lob threat aswell. It think it’s a great mix and would work excellently ."
"I wanna see a lineup of magic Johnson, Larry bird, LeBron James, Michael jordan, Wilt Chamberlain playing king of the court at some park"
&gt;	But it's pretty hard to argue that Jordan is a much better off ball player than LeBron James  There is a larger gap between their passing skills than their ability to play off the ball.
PG: Derrick Rose SG: Michael Jordan SF: Lebron James PF:Kevin Durant C: Giannis Antetokoumpo
Pretty much when ESPN posts a random too-specific stat. Ant frontrunner of it is LeBron James.
"80’s: Ralph Sampson, Charles Oakley, Dominique Wilkins, Vinnie Johnson, Magic Johnson  90’s: Hakeem Olajuwon, Shawn Kemp/ Larry Johnson/ Charles Barkley, Grant Hill, Reggie Miller, Gary Payton  00’s: Shaq, Chris Webber, Tracy Mcgrady, Allen Iverson, Gilbert Arenas   10’s: Demarcus Cousins, Kenneth Faried, LeBron James, Corey Brewer, Russell Westbrook   20’s: DeAndre Ayton, Brandon Clarke, Jayson Tatum, Donte Divincenzo, Lonzo Ball"
"80s: Larry Bird, Isiah Thomas 90s: Hakeem Olajuwan 00s: Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, LeBron James 10s: Derrick Rose, LeBron James again, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Patrick Beverley, Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Joel Embiid, Giannis, Jimmy Butler"
"&gt; The one where he still shot more FGA per game for his career than lebron despite “heavy ball movement”? &gt;  &gt;   Yes, because if you go back and watch those games (during the Phil era) he's taking those shots within the flow of the offense, and everybody ends up involved anyways. It's 100% a reasonable statement. The ball ending up in his hands =/= indicative of anything here.  I agree about LeBron's defense being insane, and their athleticism being on the same level. But it's pretty hard to argue that Jordan is a much better off ball player than LeBron James. I mean, it'd be like trying to argue Jordan was better at being tall."
"He is fucking amazing, but it is up to who else is there.  Lebron James  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Antetokounmpo  And that is it right now. So right now i'd say yes. The question would be, what happens with a healthy KD and a healthy Curry? With those two getting back to their peak levels, i'd say Harden is the 6th best player in the league."
"Lebron did indeed try to have him punished.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/report-lebron-james-pressed-adam-000504291.html  And Lebron received massive backlash for both this and his public comments.  Pretty hypocritical to say Morey must restrain his speech about the horrors of the CCP, meanwhile Lebron is free to critizise the US government. One is a lot fucking worse than the other, but one hurts Nike and Lebron’s financial interests much more as well."
"They've reduced him to scrap metal. While leading the Lakers in all stats except assists, and also leading PER and Winshares, it was all lebron's doing. AD is nothing. That's what I've been hearing this entire season. Being in DPOY stats and leading most major offensive stats is all thanks to Lebron. AD had similar output on his team, but hey, all praise be Lebron James. It's embarrassing and sad."
Pretty sure Curry can and has made clutch shots in the finals. And it's hard to compare the two in that way when Irving gets to play with LeBron James for both of his finals appearances who is kinda sorta good at basketball and the focus of every opposing defense.   KD is a better shooter than Korver because he's a far better 1on1 and P&amp;R creator and has an easier time shooting over tough defense.
"80s - Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Moses Malone, Kareem Abdul Jabbar  90s - Gary Payton, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Karl Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon  00s - Steve Nash, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Shaquille O'Neal  10s - Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Dwight Howard"
"We've never seen LeBron and Steph playing together before, but we know how good the Steph-Draymond PnR has been when you have Draymond able to make plays on the short roll.  Now imagine that the roll man there is LeBron James instead.  If you run that high PnR with two shooters and a lob threat in the dunker spot, that might be the single best play in the history of basketball."
Oh then respect to you... I remember the hype all around even after Game 7 like everyone was talking about the win and it certainly elevated LeBron James even higher than he already was and def made 2016 more memorable
"I mean ur right but who said the dicator has to only be a coach,    ex lakers LeBron James   bucks- Budenholzer and Giannis   boston brad stevens   so for the warriors it could be curry"
Sorry you’re mad but this has happened throughout the history of the NBA. Superteams have a long history:  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/nba-superteams-history-lebron-james-heat-cavaliers-warriors-061617
And you think Ryan Anderson and LeBron James have about the same level of influence there?
"[Try telling Beal, Vucevic or Huerter that their jersey swap with Wade was ""forced""](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26470795/i-wanted-chance-say-goodbye-evolution-dwyane-wade-jersey-swaps)   [Or all the ovations opposing fans would give him along this ""forced"" farewell tour.

How can you justify a Dirk farewell tour and not a Wade one? That alone tells me you're full of shit because there is no possible discrepancy between the two legacy-wise that you can tell me Dirk has the edge over Wade, or is more ""deserving"". The only reason your take even gets feedback here is because people love to hate the guy"
Especially when LeBron is probably followed by millions of kids who look up to him as a role model and I’m sure many of them are minorities. If they see their idol say they are being hunted that’s gonna make them nervous to go out and suspicious of anyone who doesn’t look like them. James’ intentions were good but his word choice was not great.
"Players with 800 games to average 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.4 steals, 49% fgs, 30% 3pt fgs. Magic Johnson, Larry bird, Michael Jordan, LeBron James and the great Thaddeus Young."

Lebron James: FUCK THE CCP!!!
"01 + 20. Fairly confident.   I think I'd probably take 01Lakers over 96, then you get to add Lebron James, Anthony Davis, and shooters to surround whatever lineup you make. The weak point is PG, and you probably play Lebron there on offense and have Kobe guard them on defence   96 is fantastic, especially the defence. 11 is great, especially the defence. The problem with these teams is what difference do you make?   Noah at the 5, Rose at the 1, Rose would be the big factor, but apart from that a lot of what 11 offers would become redundant with all the defenders that 96 and 11 have. Don't get me wrong, Deng would kill off the bench, but it's not as easy as adding shooters and athletes to a roster."
"Compared to other sports like football (soccer), the basketball court is a lot smaller, with 5 players on the court. This means that an individual player impacts the game more than an individual player in soccer.   LeBron James might be the best example to see individual impact. When he left Cleveland the first time, they went from being the best team in the East to the worst in the league. Having one dominant person on your team makes you a contender in the NBA."
&gt;I'd like to think I'd take a stand   I hope Chris Paul and LeBron James light a fire through the NBPA.
"The only way to defend against the offense of Shaq, Jordan, and Kobe is to have a lot of length and use a lot of help defense with smart rotations. None of those offensive players are elite passers (now they had seasons where they were very good to great, just not elite), which means that you need to use help and force the ball out of their hands and make it as difficult for them to isolate as possible.   On offense, I agree that we need spacing. One issue is looking at the center position because the best scoring center (IMO) is KAT, but he is a horrible defender. Since Embiid is a better three point shooter (and therefore spacer) than Jokic and the better defender of the two IMO, I think he should be taken as center and have him space the floor on offense.  I love Curry but one great thing about the Warriors was they had Klay, Draymond, and Iggy who are all amazing defenders, and so the Warriors could hide Curry. Against the offensive forces of Jordan and Kobe, that team would be seeking out Curry the whole game and I don't know how much you can hide it while also helping on everyone, so unfortunately I'd replace him.  If we're assuming players are in peak form, I'd probably run something like the following because they can space the floor and can lock in on defense (some a little more of one side of that coin than the other):  PG: LeBron James  SG: Paul George  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Kawhi Leonard  C: Joel Embiid"
Lebron James: foolish jordon
1. LeBron James 2. Larry Bird 3. Kevin Durant 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Julius Erving 6. Scottie Pippen (although I'm tempted to say Dantley)
"- Steph Curry being a bad defender (he’s not) and a playoff choker (statistically he’s not)  - All the takes early this season questioning Kawhi’s character for load managing   - That LeBron James isn’t clutch (this seriously needs to die, he’s actually one of the clutchest players of all time lol)  - Clyde Drexler was just an unskilled slasher   - James Harden’s scoring isn’t impressive because he “ref baits and gets a lot of free throws”  - Chris Paul is a playoff choker (it’s a pretty stupid myth. I could go into detail but Dom2k also made a good video about it)"
"Nah, then you just remove that player and test everyone again even if that player is Lebron fucking James you've got to conclude the season."
"If you want to support a team with young talent lead by a dynamic rookie and future superstar you can pick either the Grizzlies or the Pelicans. Out of those two teams, if you prefer the grace, agility and absurd athleticism of Ja Morant (accompanied by triple J’s killer 3 point shooting and the all around fundamentals of Ja’s college teammate Brandon Clarke), pick the Grizzlies. If you prefer the raw power, strength and also absurd athleticism of Zion Williamson (accompanied by Lonzo Ball’s flashy playmaking, Brandon Ingram’s all round scoring ability and wholesome family man and elite defensive veteran Jrue Holiday) pick the Pelicans  If neither of those suit you. You can pick a team lead by a dynamic young sophomore who is already a superstar you can either pick the Dallas Mavericks and the already elite playmaking of Luka Doncic (with some skilled but inefficient 3 point shooting to booth) accompanied by his fellow Eurostar Kristaps Porzingis or the Atlanta Hawks and Trae Young with his elite 3 point shooting and creative handles (with a host of other rookies and sophomores as a bonus)  If you want to support the big boys, pick the Lakers, if you want to support the big boys but hate Lebron James, pick the Bucks and last year’s (and likely this year’s) MVP, Giannis Antetokounmpo. If you want to support the big boys and be a hipster about it, pick the Clippers. If you want to support the big boys but want to take a break from being the big boys for a year, pick the Warriors and Steph Curry. If you want to pick the big boys and have the tolerance to put up with Drake, pick the Raptors and Spicy P. If you want to support the big boys and feel inevitable disappointment, pick James Harden, Russell Westbrook and the Houston Rockets. If you want to support next year’s big boys, pick the Celtics for Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Kemba Walker or the Brooklyn Nets with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant (don’t trust them to be good leaders though)  If you want to pretend you’re a contending team you can choose the Utah Jazz, with completely destroyed team chemisu, high flying dunker Donovan Mitchell, 2 time DPOY going on 3 Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley who swears he was good last year. Or you can choose the Denver Nuggets with Nikola Jokic, who has previously starred in Ghostbusters as the Stay Puft monster. Or you could choose the 76ers, a team that could have been legit contenders but royally screwed it up  If you want a team that might be contenders in a few years, you can pick the Thunder, currently lead by veteran all time great point guard Chris Paul, have a promising young Combo guard in Shai Gilgeous Alexander and an unholy amount of future draft picks. Alternatively you can pick the Orlando Magic, with an all star center and talented young defenders or the Miami Heat and Jimmy Butler who is basically Michael Jordan with less talent and more anger  If you want to follow a team that can’t really get better or worse, pick either the San Antonio Spurs, the Portland Trail Blazers, the Washington Wizards or the Detroit Pistons  If you want to play the very long game for supporting a team that might have a decent future, you can choose between, the Timberwolves, the Kings or the Bulls  If you want to be constantly depressed follow the Hornets or the Knicks"
"None of these factors support your claiming there will be an “asterisk” as you and Shaq so boldly proclaim. I’ll say this again, it will be different. Different does not mean asterisk.  &gt; A 2+ month break for a 35 year old player is a hell of a lot different than the same break for a 25 year old player.  Okay? Sure, in theory a 35 year old needs more rest time than a 25 year old. Yet, let’s look at the reality of two of the (arguably) most impactful players in the league. Kawhi Leonard is only 28, Lebron James is 35. Yet they don’t occupy the roles in this conversation one would expect. Most teams have a mix of older and younger players, meaning it’s basically a wash for any major advantage. Might some players benefit more than others? Probably. But there are ALWAYS little advantages and disadvantages in play throughout a season, most of which aren’t even known to the public. Perhaps one teams important Star is having marital/family problems. Perhaps a family member just died. You’re being way too selective about this, choosing to only focus on the aspects that support your argument.  &gt; Players with minor injuries or were pushing through can come back new.  I can’t figure out how you think teams getting healthier across the board supports the idea of an asterisk, at all. Once again, it does make it DIFFERENT than what we’re used to seeing in the playoffs. You have yet to provide any logical reasoning for why different means worse.  &gt; A 2+ month break for a physical team is different than one for a non physical team.  This is an incredibly shallow argument. If one teams “level of physicality” results in them being totally unprepared (or more prepared) for the playoffs because of this, then so be it. That still doesn’t mean there’s an asterisk for the winner.  &gt; 82 games is a fucking grind, yes 2+ months off is not the same thing.  Once again, people tried this sorry argument during the lockout shortened season. Years later, nobody even brings it up in context to the eventual champions. Both years were shortened. The only difference is when the time off occurred. In both cases, teams still didn’t have to play full seasons, thereby creating an unfair “advantage” for certain teams over others, based on your argument.  All of your points still do nothing to support your initial statement of there being an asterisk. Are there differences? Yes. Nobody has said there isn’t. But you have provided nothing of substance that would lead a person to an informed opinion that an eventual champion wouldn’t deserve the same recognition as everybody else. There are ALWAYS external factors that affect the outcome of games. Did the air conditioning breaking during the Heat-Spurs series put an asterisk on that game? I say not. Theoretically, it’s not going to affect every player the same, and there’s no way to know for sure who was more affected by it than others. Perhaps one teams bus broke down on the way to an important finals game, leading to them showing up late to the arena and having less time to warm up/prepare. Would the other team, if they win, have an asterisk next to that victory?  To sum up, difference =/= less meaningful."
"The way defense is played really leaves no comparison to MJ, IMO. Help defenders are asked to do so much more now. LeBron was also a beastly perimeter defender, and was elite at every facet of defense during his time with Miami. I just don't see how you can call either the better defender. At their peaks they were one of the best defenders in the league and you really couldn't go wrong choosing either. I wasn't necessarily arguing that James was the better defender."
"It's a very simple concept, really. Lebron James and Colin Kaepernick are protesting racism against their own race. They are part of that experience, they are living in it. They are simply using the platform they have to raise awareness for things they know about. Hong Kong is not something Lebron James is intimately familiar with.   It was ridiculous for him to tell Daryl Morey not to voice his opinion, but expecting Lebron James, someone who has never lived in Hong Kong nor understands the delicate balance of China and Hong Kong, to properly stand up for the people of Hong Kong isn't fair.  The Hong Kong-China situation is a **political** situation on top of being a **human rights** situation. Commentary on one influences the other. Lebron is a human rights advocate (obviously you can call him a hypocrite for it if you want) but he is not a politician. Meddling in the politics of other nations is a surefire way to put a target on your back. Lebron's got a family to think about, not just his image.  Ali and Mahmoud (Not Mohammad) Abdul Rauf were protesting different things. Ali protested the war itself. It's a common pasttime, and an incredibly, insanely stupid one, for Americans to get into a massive huff whenever someone doesn't support a war in this country. Happened in Iraq when we had 0 actual evidence to even go to war; people who didn't support it were still ostracized and threatened. Abdul Rauf was protesting the atrocities the US itself makes around the world. It's nothing new for our country to tout freedom of speech but only if it's in support of the nation.  But, just the simple fact that you thought Mahmoud Abdul Rauf's first name was Mohammed shows you're just looking to be outraged."
"Morey raised awareness? He backed the fuck down.   And what came out of that ""raised awareness""?   Did it effect any change? NO!   All it did was give people a chance to say, ""Omg I feel so bad for them.""  We can't do *shit* about it.   Well, we can. We can stop buying Chinese products and start voting with our wallets.   But we don't want to do that, do we?   The reality is, is that it is halfway across the Earth and it doesn't effect us personally.   And that's how the world works.   Why aren't you angry that LeBron James hasn't spoken out about every single injustice that occurs in the world every day?  I am aware of what's going on in China and Hong Kong. It saddens me. That is the end of my involvement. I feel bad for them.   In order to fight back, we would have to decrease our quality of life (the vast majority of us). You willing to do that for someone you'll likely never interact ever in your entire life?   And if you ARE more personally involved in that fight, good for you. You are a better person than me, and I am not directing these words at you."
"And? There is nothing wrong with that. Absolutely nothing. LeBron James, and the rest of the NBA, should not be forced to sacrifice their money so that Morey can tweet out in support of Hong Kong.  That's the problem. Morey wasn't speaking for himself in that particular situation. He can say whatever he wants about China, but in order to do so, he needs to leave the position he is in so that other people aren't brought into the mix.   Or Morey could have consulted with everyone before moving forward with that tweet.  Edit: The situation with China is unique in that it deals with the economy of an entire country, and it effects the bottom of the NBA *as a whole*. You cannot compare that to the ""I can't breathe"" comments."
show me where Stephen Jackson spoke out against china  in fact: https://www.tmz.com/2019/10/16/stephen-jackson-defends-lebron-james-china-backlash-hong-kong-al-harrington/   yall just wanna whine about lebron in particular despite all he's done lmao
Better then LeBron shut and up dribble James.   LBJ is a fake social justice warrior. He's no different then Trump and y'all can't see it. Only cares about his own kind and wont help others if it costs him money.
15 dollar for Lebron James
"Wow, pretty sure you are the only person who thinks Austin fucken Rivers, isn't at the Lebron James level.  They are almost identical. Twins even."
"I like that front court a lot.  1 - Gary Payton ($2)  2 - Klay Thompson ($3)  3 - Chris Mullin ($1)   4 - LeBron James ($7)  5 - Dave Cowens ($2)  Good back court defense, Thompson/Mullin don't need the rock to be effective, and Cowens/Bron can wreck shop inside.  Only being able to take 2 guys from each era is tough."
My list  1) LeBron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Steph Curry  4) James Harden  5) Chris Paul  6) Kawhi Leonard  7) Russell Westbrook  8) Kyle Lowry  9) Marc Gasol  10) Blake Griffin  11) Anthony Davis  12) Damian Lillard  13) Dirk Nowitzki  14) Al Horford  15) Dwyane Wade  16) LaMarcus Aldridge  17) Paul George  18) Kyrie Irving  19) Kevin Love  20) Mike Conley
Obviously Carmelo Anthony was never gonna be a as good as LeBron James that would be putting way to much stock in rings. Especially cause Carmelo wouldn't have been the best player on those pistons teams
"Yes, LeBron James was clearly the problem in 2004 and 2006. You’ve figured it out"
Basketball refences created one page for Lebron's elimination games:  [https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2017/06/lebron-james-when-facing-elimination/](https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2017/06/lebron-james-when-facing-elimination/)  just absurd numbers
"Lebron James $7, Michael Jordan $7, Chris Mullin $1 George McGinnis $1 Yao Ming $1  I'll pay the luxury tax as I go over the cap"
"**Showtime version**  * Magic Johnson $6 (basically a cheaper Lebron James and a better point guard) * James Worthy $2 (inside forward, steal in terms of combo with Magic) * Wilt $5 (I dare you to tell me you don't want to see him play vs TV era players). * Chris Webber $1 (biggest steal on the board imo, can play shooting forward) * Baron Davis $1 (I need shooting bad, he's gonna spot up on 3s).  Pros: Showtime with Wilt. Get it. Size should hold up.  Cons: Outside shooting could be lacking versus some shooting focused teams. Defense could be lacking versus some defense focused teams  **Defense version** (this one was harder because team lacks playmaking).  * Jrue Holiday $1 (biggest 3+D steal in modern era on the board) * Victor Oladipo $1 (2018 all defensive first team) * Bill Russell $6 (Wilt stopper) * Grant Hill $4 (arguably biggest injury letdown career over Tmac and Brendan Roy) * Kevin Mchale $3 (NBA All-Defensive First or Second Team six times, biggest defensive steal on the board)  Pros: Defense duh. Shooting isn't bad here either  Cons: Um who's passing the ball? Dipo and Grant has to share point duties. Offense is a concern. Is offense from the block still a thing?  Backup picks (Rasheed Wallace, Scottie Pippen, )  P.S. HOW is Giannis only $5!?! with CP at $6 and Tmac at $5, even Bosh and Kidd are also $5.."
"Random thought for the nba + anime fans here  If NBA legends were Hokages (Naruto). If you've never seen Naruto you won't get this.  1st Hokage Michael Jordan. GOAT. He was the first legend, unmatched skill and mentality of his time. Created his own brand and is known as the best basketball player ever.  2nd Hokage Kobe Bryant. Some could say he was the younger brother of MJ. He had unmatched skill and mentality, similar to his brother, but with a bit more splashing (3's and water nature type reference). Creator of the Mamba mentality technique, is used by many top players today. He was also the mentor to the 3rd Hokage. Kobe however (like the real 2nd Hokage) died young.  3rd Hokage. Lebron James. Very skilled, fast, athletic, strong, and old. Has been one of the best players for many years. Skilled at all techniques of modern game. Has trained and played with some of the greats of before.  4th/7th Hokage Stephen Curry. Changed the game. He uses techniques from the 2nd Hokage (Kobe) but brings it to a different level. Has a quick release (no hands seals needed) on his technique. Was schooled by the 3rd Hokage early in his career but eventually got to his level.  That's all I got, i'm bored, hope you enjoyed that."
"Didn’t AD inside and AD pick and roll help a ton with sweeping the Blazers? Where does this idea come from that anything involving Davis without James is meh? The Lakers haven’t been as good with AD on and Lebron off, but the players and style of playing around AD might change in the playoffs and we’ve seen him be dominant without an elite creator.   But honestly, the answer to your question, aside from AD actually being really good, is just that Lebron doesn’t get to have those games. Maybe that seems ridiculous but this is Lebron James we are talking, the answer is him finding a way to create enough elite offense. That’s what he’s had to do every year, even against the West teams in the finals.  Maybe the Lakers would be better but AD is providing a ton on offense and might just turn out to be a more impactful defender than Kawhi is able to be at this point in the playoffs."
"Based on what, assists? LeBron make more passes by playing point guard and inflates his assists. Even his own teammates accuse him of just making assist passes rsther than moving the ball: https://www.google.com/amp/s/lebronwire.usatoday.com/2018/01/12/report-some-cavs-believe-lebron-james-is-assist-hunting/amp/"
"Yeah ok, that's why I made sure to mention that in a buried comment chain, I just wanted all 4 people who would see it to know that I'm hot shit. If I cared at all about listing my accomplishments then why would I stop there? Wouldn't I be mentioning what else I've done in other comments? It was literally only in reference to somebody saying I don't understand what sample size is.   We're talking about sports and I guess I should just ignore anybody who doesn't understand that sample size is restricted when we're talking about the Finals. Keep it up though, name calling because we disagree on a topic. But I don't know what I expected from somebody who's 30 and spends their free time insulting another person because they're not obsessed with your lord and savior, Lebron James."
"What type of an excuse is that? If the team tanks that hard because of one sub-par player, you’re not an MVP player. Simple as that. Were the Rockets shit in the 17 games Joey Dorsey started for them in 2014-15? No, they went 11-6 because James Harden is an MVP tier player.  And the Lakers were well above average when LeBron was on the court last season and were 28-27 with him in the lineup at all. The team was complete and utter shit when he say. That’s not to mention the barrage of injuries."
"Wizards (24-40) - Ted Leonsis who kept Ernie Grunfeld far past his expiry date as a GM, been accused of focusing more on the Caps in the NHL  Hornets (23-42) - MJ, with a far worse track record as an owner than a player, lowballed Kemba this past summer only to sign Terry Rozier to a hefty contract  Bulls (22-43) - Jerry Reinsdorf, known for being too cheap and loyal to GarPax, also accused of caring more about the White Sox than the Bulls  Knicks (21-45) - James Dolan...his track record the last few years really speaks for itself  Pistons (20-46) - Tom Gores, purchased the team in Sep 2015, record since then: 181-263, 2 first round sweeps  Hawks (20-47) - Majority Owner Tony Ressler purchased the team in June 2015, since then has overhauled much of the front office and coaching staff along with the roster. Super young team so I'll honestly give them the benefit of the doubt here  Cavaliers (19-46) - Dan Gilbert purchased the team in March 2005. Record without LeBron: 135-324, 3 first overall picks since 2011, none still with the team  Yup, if you have a bad owner, you're pretty likely to have a bad team."
Here's a list of the top 10 players in terms of MVP shares. I imagine that after this year LeBron will overtake MJ.  1.[Michael Jordan](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html)\*8.115  2.[**LeBron James**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html)8.067  3.[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/abdulka01.html)\*6.105  4.[Larry Bird](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/birdla01.html)\*5.612  5.[Magic Johnson](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsma02.html)\*5.104  6.[Bill Russell](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html)\*4.748  7.[Shaquille O'Neal](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/onealsh01.html)\*4.380  8.[Karl Malone](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/malonka01.html)\*4.296  9.[Tim Duncan](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duncati01.html)\*4.278  10.[Kobe Bryant](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bryanko01.html)\*4.202
Breaking news: LeBron James signs max deal with Sun Kings
"LeBron James and JR are actually really good friends. He’s cool with Lance too, he asked him to come play for the Lakers"
Low hanging fruit:   Isaiah Thomas and MJ  KG and Big Baby   Shaq and Kobe   Lebron James and Lance Stephenson   Lebron James and JR Smith  Russell Westbrook and KD
"awful take. I have no emotional attachment to either of those guys or the teams they played for, but IMO, LeBron has the best three *easily* and they’d shake out like this  **1. 2016**  LeBron averaged 29.7/11.3/8.9 on .494/.371/.721  Duh. 3-1 comeback on a 73-9 team, down 7 at half in game 7 after Draymond went the fuck OFF in the first half. Three straight pantheon, all-time great level performances w/ great compliment from Kyrie. Counter: Curry unhealthy during playoffs (an excuse imo) Draymond suspended, Bogut injured. But Dray missed one game and Bogut is nowhere near as important as the guys Cleveland was without in ‘15.    **2- 2013** LeBron averaged 25.3/10.9/7.0 on /.447/.353/.795  Spurs were a great team and absolutely had Miami on the ropes with less than 30 to go. If LeBron missing the 3 that led to the Ray Allen shot has a negative impact to you, you need to consider he dominated Game 7. If you thought San Antonio was washed for some reason in the moment, they fucked the Heat up in 2014. Tim Duncan was incredible in 2013 and LeBron prevented his legacy from potentially being 6-0 in the Finals with 4 FMVPs, should they repeat in ‘14, which I don’t think would’ve happened. Counter: What? Wade was still good? San Antonio choked? Bron was great.   **3-2012**- LeBron averaged 28.6/10.2/7.4 on .477/.188/.826  In what universe is 2015 more impressive than beating KD, who has ascended and is 2 seasons away from being named MVP. Russ was an all-star already and was five years away from being named MVP. James Harden was on this team too, who would also go on to be an MVP. Oh, they also have peak athletic, 3.5 BPG Serge Ibaka too. OKC took Game 1 and the next three were close before Shoeless Mike Miller hit a hundred threes and buried the Thunder, creating a false narrative that series was a blowout.   **4-2015** Curry averaged 26.0/5.2/6.3 on .443/.385/.885  Overrated IMO. No Kyrie after game 1. No Kevin Love, and the dominating narrative until Game 4 was how well Matthew Dellavedova was guarding Steph Curry. In Game 2, with no Kyrie, Steph went 5-23 and 2-15 from three, but Klay’s 34 were enough to squeak it out. Curry has a great game 3, with 27 pts on 50% shooting, 7 threes and the only knock is 6 TO’s. Like Game 1 where Curry posted a similar line, GS lost. In Game 4, Iguodala and Curry both had 22 points, with Iggy doing it on two less attempts and helping to hold LeBron to 31% shooting. Game 5 was the Curry game, where he went the fuck off and helped the team win a finals game for literally the first time in his career. By this point, LeBron’s fellow starters were **Matthew Dellavedova, Iman Shumpert, Tristan Thompson and Timofey Mozgov**. In the closeout game, Iguodala again matched Curry’s point total on more efficient shooting from the field and behind the arc. You can definitely argue that Steph deserved the 2015 FMVP, but in my opinion, in the spirit of the honor, Iggy deserved it. He swung the series, though obviously the clear counter to that take is that they don’t win the fucking series w/o Curry lol.   I spent so much time on the other ones that I think we can all agree 2017 is marginally more impressive than 2018, but that gaining Kevin Durant guaranteed the Warriors those titles save injuries, like in 2019. I don’t at all hold the ‘19 Finals against Curry, and if GSW wins that series that’s the second best one on this list, easily.  Curry in ‘17: 26.8/8.0/9.4 on .440/.388/.897   Curry in ‘18: 27.5/6.0/6.8 on .402/.415/1.000  edit: forgot to add numbers"
"Lebron James is facing Twitch streamers, Soundcloud rappers and reality TV actors"
"4th Quarter shooting in the Playoffs  * 2018-19 - 42.9 FG% (1st round loss) * 2017-18 - 30.6 FG% (1st round loss) * 2016-17 - 33.3 FG% (4 game sweep and [famously threw his teammate under the bus as not being up to the task of high pressure shots in the 4th quarter](https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-response-paul-george-cj-miles-cavs-pacers-game-12017-4)) * 2015-16 - 48.3 FG% (played really well, just a tough as hell series)  He's dealt with injuries and such, and his TS% is much better for all these (he got to the line a bunch, like a superstar offensive player should), and in the years prior to 2015 he shot well, but people will remember if you mostly miss with the game on the line.  And he brought it on himself from 2017 onward for the shitty way he left the Pacers and shat on his teammates.  I don't really have a strong opinion on this, I was just curious and looked it up.  If you're asking me, he's an amazing player, but it's on PG to overcome a self-imposed reputation by actually being able to make shots at the end of games.  If I'm a Clippers fan, I definitely want the ball in Kawhi's hands."
Larry bird is better than lebron james in todays nba lmao OKAYYY DUDE
I was being facetious. Milkmen is the big running joke on this sub for anytime PLJ (pre LeBron James)
"The early Celtics racked up titles because they just happened to develop a great organization in an early point in the league history, where they were able to dominate.   The modern Celtics have mostly kept up that reputation of being a well run team, but the timing for them just wasn't right for winning a championship in the past decade (and in the NBA, building a championship team is in large part about being in the right place in the right time.) Their 2008 Big 3 was a good team, but in their last years of being a potential contender ran into Lebron James, who dominated the Eastern Conference for a decade. The C's did a good job of moving on, retooling the team to stay competitive most of the decade while setting themselves up to add younger talent. But you still had LeBron James hanging around, and only recently has Jayson Tatum emerged as the type of long term star/leader you usually need to win a championship. Overall they've mostly made the right moves to position themselves as potential contenders, but on a timeline that didn't line up recently to win it all."
"David Thompson  Klay Thompson  Chris Mullin  LeBron James  Arvydas Sabonis  I think Klay is a great value here because he can play well with pretty much any supertar. Whereas Melo for $1 on first glance seems like a steal, but he's a questionable complimentary piece and isn't good enough to be your first banana against this competition.  edit: Also if you're going off peak value, DRose, Roy, Penny Hardaway are really good options."
"LeBron has faced 21 MVPs in the playoffs (I'm using former MVPs and near MVPs, so in this scenario 2012 Westbrook counts even though he won MVP in 2017):   2007: Tim Duncan  2008: Kevin Garnett  2010: Derrick Rose, Kevin Garnett  2011: Kevin Garnett, Derrick Rose, Dirk Nowitzki  2012: Kevin Garnett, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden  2013: Tim Duncan  2014: Kevin Garnett (Shell of himself), Tim Duncan   2015: Derrick Rose (Shell of Himself), Steph Curry  2016: Steph Curry  2017: Steph Curry, Kevin Durant  2018: Steph Curry, Kevin Durant     13/21 came in the finals. For reference, Dirk played against Karl Malone, Tim Duncan x6, Kevin Garnett, Steve Nash x2, Shaq, Kobe, Kevin Durant x3, Russell Westbrook x3, James Harden, LeBron James, James Harden. (This doesn't include Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade or other arguable MVPs).   Dirk has faced 21 MVPs. LeBron's facing 10 former MVPs in the finals isn't that impressive, it just shows that more often than not the MVP was in the Western conference because the West was so much harder."
"This isn't true.   Shaq faced 2 MVPs (Allen Iverson and Dirk)  Duncan faced 3 (LeBron James x3)  Kobe faced 3 (Iverson, Garnett x3)"

Lebron won't be the passers that magic was  I'm goat James  fan club by the way
I can't defend the pig socks and I can't defend the Castro shirt. Those were dumb. His Girlfriend can say whatever she wants though. I don't think that matters here. She can have her own thoughts and opinions. Wearing those socks and that shirt doesn't undo the good that he did which was a peaceful protest. Muhammad Ali has done a lot of great things but he did call Joe Frazier an Uncle Tom and a gorilla. LeBron James has spoken out on the injustice in this country but those China comments have changed the way people view him. We can go higher to someone like MLK. He cheated on his wife. These guys have said and  done some fucked up things but they're not enough to undo all of the good they've done
"Like I said in another comment, let's go 7 deep. *Is the 7-man lineup of Harden-CP3-Capela-PJ Tucker-Eric Gordon-Austin Rivers-Gerald Green really that much more talented than LeBron James-Kyrie Irving-KLove-Tristan Thompson-JR Smith-Channing Frye-Kyle Korver ??*  To the point where, ""Bron's didn't have enough help"" and ""Harden's a playoff choker""?"
"kobmug likes: LeBron James, Ben Taylor, Steph Curry, D Wade  kobmug hates: Michael Jordan, Small market teams, Kevin Love  IDK, it was certainly brought up a lot that people thought the Cavs were better without Kevin Love, who didn't have a good Finals at all. But he had a decent enough 2017 Finals (outplayed Klay Thompson as far as third options go) such that I'm not sure what to make of too small a sample size."
"You are confused on the rules, and so was the broadcast  The refs have the authority to rule on two things:  - if he was in the restricted area  - if he was in a legal guarding position  *while reviewing* the first, they may *also* determine if the second is accurate  &gt;  While reviewing, they may also confirm if the defender was in legal guarding position when the contact occurred.  they know he's not in the restricted area, they confirm that almost immediately, the broadcast even plainly says that, what they're checking for is if he's in a legal guarding position. Which he's not.   https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/31/17416184/lebron-james-charge-kevin-durant-overturned-block-foul-cavs-warriors-game-1-nba-finals  it's been reported on a dozen times, is consistent with the official NBA rulebook, and is exactly what the game report from the NBA says"
Larry Bird &gt; Lebron James
"All i'm saying is, LeBron James scoring 8 points in a finals game loss.   Is inexcusable to LeBron James    I think he left the game thinking, he should have played much differently."
"Every poster on this board is a human, just like George Floyd and just like lebron james."
"Definitely some racism in there, it may be subtle so it's harder to pick up on. How can you not support Lebron's incredible social activism unless you disagree with said activism. (BLM, Building schools for underprivileged youth, Calling out our racist president, supporting Kap, raising awareness to oppression against the black community, etc.)  You would have to oppose what he stands for if you don't want him talking about it. Also don't get me started on the colorism that could be at play here, white folks historically have had greater comfortable with lighter skinned blacks who look less ""threatening"" such as baby faced Curry, over the darker skinned, 6'8 physically domineering LeBron James. Not saying your parents are Klu Klux members burning crosses or anything lol, but racism is often coded and hidden between the lines...   \- mixed race guy who has lived with his white family and seen subtle racism for years"
"1.  Kawhi Leonard - proven playoffs monster in his absolute prime, significantly improved playmaker this season.  2. LeBron James - one of the best, if not the best playoffs player of all time. Best playmaking season of his career, but scoring and defense has become less transcendent due to declining athleticism. 2 years since last playoffs (in which he was the best player perhaps)  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo - best regular season player, probably the deserving DPOY this year. Production dips in playoffs as opposing teams with great defense wall him off (see 19-20 raptors)  4. Steph Curry - another proven playoff monster, famous for ""choke job"" in 16 finals, but (1) he was injured and (2) he was killing everyone else in every other series. Would've been higher than giannis if not for missing time   5. James Harden - the best offensive player in the regular season, significant playoff drop off but still very good, just not all time carry job status."
"From a neutral POV watching that, there was no choke job. Just a very slightly better team with, in my opinion, the best player in the world at that point (or at absolute worst, 3rd best) finally asserting themselves in a do or die moment over a team with tons of synergy and chemistry that, while talented, ""shouldn't"" have been playing the Cavs to a virtual draw over the course of the series.  And Jason Tatums monster stuff right in LeBron James' face shortly after getting rejected on a dunk by LeBron was one of the most emphatic revenge plays I've ever seen, especially from a young guy. It wasn't even ego/cocky to me but the amount of confidence and psychological resiliency it takes to launch for that jam was super impressive. The potential worry about getting blocked again and feeling embarrassed and being a joke after the game clearly never entered his head.  Anyway, enough gushing, Cavs were just better - though not by much - and deserved to win, I don't think Boston choked. That was a fun team to watch. I hope that without Kyrie and with Hayward [crosses fingers] back nearer to 100% they can be like that again, although they do seem to miss Horford's leadership somewhat still."
"LeBron's prime was definitely better. LeBron has entire playoff series' where he averaged what looked like Bird's game-highs for most of his playoff runs, and Bird played in an era with a much higher pace than most of James' career."

LeBron is easy 1st, with Curry and KD being tough to decide between, but had to go with Curry due to the two MVPs, one being the only ever unanimous MVP. *(Honourables: James Harden)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Playoff MVP of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|FMVPs|Titles|Series W's|Total Pts| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|LeBron James|3|3|28|5,150| |2nd|Kevin Durant|2|2|21|4,043| |3rd|Stephen Curry|-|3|19|2,968|  &amp;nbsp;  - LeBron is obvious 1st again. Durant's longevity and production in the post-season nets him 2nd. FMVPs are good indicators, but only tell a smart part to a post season story, and therefore Steph is comfortably 3rd in my book. *(Honourables: Kawhi Leonard)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Rookie Season of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|ROY|PPG|RPG|APG| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Luka Dončić|2018-19|21.2|7.8|6.0| |2nd|Ben Simmons|2017-18|15.8|8.1|8.2| |3rd|Damian Lillard|2012-13|19.0|3.1|6.5|  &amp;nbsp;  - Comparing all rookie seasons over the course of a decade, Luka would be my favourite for 1st, edging out Simmons. Dame's rookie campaign may have been forgotten, but if you win ROY unanimously over a player like AD, you did something special. *(Honourables: Donovan Mitchell, Karl-Anthony Towns)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Defensive Player of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|DPOYs|DRtg|DWS|DBPM| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Kawhi Leonard|2|100|28.1|+2.4| |2nd|Draymond Green|1|102|27.7|+2.8| |3rd|Rudy Gobert|2|100|24.2|+2.3|  &amp;nbsp;  - In an era of ever-growing perimeter threats, Kawhi has established himself as a defensive juggernaut with his length, strength and oven size mitts. Draymond and Rudy are obvious 2nd and 3rd picks. *(Honourables: Dwight Howard)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Most Improved Player of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|MIP|Draft Pick|Current Status|Change in Points per 36| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Giannis Antetokounmpo|2016-17|15th|MVP Tier|24.5| |2nd|Kawhi Leonard|-|15th|MVP Tier|18.1| |3rd|Jimmy Butler|2014-15|30th|Perenial All-Star|12.4|  &amp;nbsp;  - This is improvement over the course of a decade, as opposed to a singular season. So many options to choose from for this award, but Giannis &amp; Kawhi has to be 1 &amp; 2. Both drafted outside the lottery from lesser known programs, both began with a mix of bench and starter minutes, and both ultimately turned into titans of the game. Butler's ascension has also been remarkable, and I'm comfortable to have him at 3rd. *(Honourables: Stephen Curry, James Harden)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Sixth Man of the Decade**  ||Name|6MOYs|PPG|RPG|APG| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Lou Williams|3|16.1|2.4|3.6| |2nd|Jamal Crawford|3|14.2|1.8|2.8| |3rd|James Harden|1|12.7|3.4|2.5|  &amp;nbsp;  - Lou beats out Jamal here just because of Jamal's reduced production in his last two seasons, otherwise it would be impossible to determine. 3rd was also tough to pick, but I had to go with the bench star of those baby Thunder teams.

The Heat’s consistency and ability to re-stabilise after the success of the Big 3 Heat helps him place 3rd. *(Honourables: Mike Budenholser, Brad Stevens)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Scorer of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|Scoring Titles|Total Pts|PPG|TS%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Kevin Durant|4|19,445|28.0|62.6%| |2nd|James Harden|2|18,627|24.3|60.9%| |3rd|LeBron James|-|19,550|26.9|60.9%|  &amp;nbsp;  - KD's insane scoring production, consistency and efficiency makes it easy to select him as the top scorer of the decade. Harden is without a doubt second, as he almost makes it boring to talk about his 40+ point games now. Fun fact if we only counted his years on the Rockets, he'd be averaging 29.0 PPG, only behind the career averages of Jordan &amp; Wilt. And LeBron isn't considered a scorer first, but its insane to think he's totalled more points than KD, due in large part to durability and volume consistency. *(Honourables: Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Shooter of the Decade**  ||Name|3PM|3P%|FG%|FT%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Stephen Curry|2,483|43.6%|47.7%|90.5%| |2nd|Klay Thompson|1,798|41.9%|45.9%|84.8%| |3rd|Kyle Korver|1,514|44.5%|45.5%|87.0%|  &amp;nbsp;  - Best shooter of the decade, best shooter in history, same thing for Stephen Curry. His running mate Klay comes in 2nd due to the countless times of historical shooting nights that make you question if you've ever seen him miss before. And Kyle Korver doesn't get talked about much these days, but he is consistently one of the most efficient 3 point shooters ever, he comes in 3rd. *(Honourables: Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Durant)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Franchise of the Decade**  ||Team|Titles|Series W's|Record|Win%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Golden State Warriors|3|19|505-299|62.8%| |2nd|Miami Heat|2|15|480-324|59.7%| |3rd|San Antonio Spurs|1|13|559-245|69.5%| |4th|Cleveland Cavaliers|1|14|388-416|48.3%| |5th|Toronto Raptors|1|8|440-364|54.7%| |6th|Dallas Mavericks|1|4|420-384|52.2%| |7th|Los Angeles Lakers|1|6|363-441|45.1%|  &amp;nbsp;  - Champions write history, so I included all of them.  &amp;nbsp;  **Non-Champion Franchise of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Team|Furthest Round|Series W's|Record|Win%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Oklahoma City Thunder|Finals|10|515-289|64.1%| |2nd|Boston Celtics|Finals|10|456-347|56.8%| |3rd|Houston Rockets|Conference Finals|6|488-316|60.7%|  &amp;nbsp;  - Showing some love to non-champions and their valiant efforts, not to be forgotten. *(Honourables: LA Clippers, Indiana Pacers, Memphis Grizzlies)*  &amp;nbsp;  Any awards I could add?

"I don't understand why you're taking this person as ""discrediting LeBron"" because they're not even doing that. All they're saying is that LeBron is 100% correct here, but it does make his comments on China stick out like a sore thumb. And thus, brings into question his motivation behind it.   You even said yourself that he can be both right AND wrong. So someone can easily say, ""Great that LeBron said this, but I wish he wouldn't be an activist only when it's convenient. It makes it look like he just likes the good PR.""  That should really not get your haunches up so much. Because the relevance comes from the relationship between LeBron James and political activism."

"Lol.   Another example for you.  I’m LeBron James. I say “Hey Tidho, what happen to George Floyd is fucked up, and we need change in our country”.   Is your brain so fucking small that you think it is appropriate to tell me, LeBron James, that I’m a hypocrite about China and completely ignore the actual issue, which is *listed in the thread title*.   You may say yes, but that’s not how normal human interaction works. If my friend comes to me about an issue, I don’t immediately change the subject to shame that person and ignore the actual issue at hand. Just not how real life works."
"So what are you saying really? If the system is rigged for both the cops and black people to have this ongoing feud that will never die down, why are people so surprised to see these videos? Moreover, why are people like Lebron James implying black people are being ""hunted"" by the police, if antagonizing the police historically just leads to the things like those in the video.    See this is what bothers me about the whole thing, there's too much importance being placed on cops to ""stop being racist and hunt black people"".    If the game is rigged and they are supposed to be raised by the system to be racist, than the target shouldn't be the cops but the politicians, or idk, someone who has the power to change these things. What I'm getting at is this, people like Lebron don't care about any of this, they just do it to be socially regarded as ""woke"", or they just don't understand that behind every one of these horrible videos is a system that led to this. So why not tweet or what ever at a congressman, major , president, I have no idea. Those are the people that actually respond to mass pressure, since they have something to loose if they loose votes. Retweeting these videos is all well and good, but the average Lebron follower is not going to look at this video and say, yeee fuck the god damn system man, lets change something by getting @ people that matter and are in office. No, they are just going to see this and say man fuck the pigs, they the kkk #wordup#woke#blesson.   Do you think Lebron even understands this and cares? I mean the China thing certainly has me thinking that he knows all of this , but doesn't really get at the heart of the issue because it will cost him and the league money.    But since he doesn't do that, we just get this ""mad woke"" instagram or tweet that serves to no end but to antagonize people further against the police, the police get further more defensive about all of this because their neck is out there on the line, and nothing changes. Idk , this whole celebritys pointing out social wrongdoings, but not actually calling out anyone just scratches me the wrong way every time."
why tf are you so obsessed on defending LeBron James when George Floyd was just murdered by a policeman?
"What if the Grizzlies had won the Lottery in 2003 and not gotten 2nd?   The Grizzlies pick was Top 1 protected. We got 2nd and so it was shipped to Detroit who took Darko. Obviously the Grizzlies would have taken Lebron #1 if they had won it.  The Grizzlies would have had a potential starting lineup of: Jason Williams, Mike Miller, Lebron James, Pau Gasol, Lorenzen Wright. 6th man would have been Shane Battier off the bench.   The Lebron-Pau pairing could have been something special in Memphis."
"He objectively does not raise his production in the playoffs. I'm a Harden fan but there's no denying the stats. If you compare his last 5 seasons almost literally everything goes down in the playoffs. He would also get noticeably winded in the second half of basically every playoff game of theirs I watched.   If you look at the last 5 years it difference would look like this. He doesn't completely shit the bed but he objectively produces less in basically every stat. The only things that improve are his ft% (86% -&gt; 88%), his turnovers per game (4.7 -&gt; 4.6) and his steals per game (1.8 -&gt; 2).   | Regular season | Playoffs |--------------|-------- James Harden | 30.4/6.4/8.4 | 28.6/5.7/7.3 LeBron | 26.3/7.6/7.7 | 30.1/9.2/7.6 Steph | 26.1/4.8/6.9 | 26.5/5.5/6.2"
"What does George Floyd's murder have to do with LeBron James' lack of comments on Hong Kong protestors?  Do you seriously have his dick in your mouth like that, that you had to comment something completely unrelated? At a time like this?"
"Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Stephen Curry,  Yao Ming."
"But what did he have to say about Hong Kong?  Looking at the post about Lebron James’ statement on this here, that’s all we care about right?"
"-	Wouldn’t have wasted picks -	Traded players at their peak value instead of at their lowest -	Made a strong bench a necessity instead of an afterthought like Colangelo did -	Wouldn’t have focused on name recognition and instead would’ve based his moves on potential &amp; fit -	Potentially would’ve shut Fultz down completely once his shooting became noticeably bad instead of throwing him out there “to get over it” and then pulling him out completely -	Made the draft the key part of building a team instead of FA (like Colangelo and his guys) -	Gotten backup bigs for Embiid   Btw none of this is biased I can list down example for each thing.  1.	Hinkie drafted players like Holmes, Grant &amp; Saric based off of potential and what they could be. Colangelo drafted euro players because either they could shoot (not really except for Kork) or just because he loved ridiculously raw players (like Bolden &amp; TLC) 2.	Hinkie trades MCW and gets a 1st round pick. Almost trades Okafor for BKN’s ‘17 1st but was blocked by Jerry Colangelo. Colangelo has to give up a 2nd to ship Okafor off &amp; only gets back 2nds for Noel. 3.	Hinkie’s “Process team” included TJ, RoCo, Holmes &amp; Grant. BC’s bench consisted of Amir Johnson, Jerryd Bayless &amp;...others. 4.	See #3. He went crazy over getting RoCo. All of BC’s moves were about getting already known players on the down turn. 5.	Look at what Sam did with Embiid. Made decisions about shutting him down and that was the end of it. BC even kept the Simmons situation ongoing with fake updates about his “return”. Simmons camp had to shut the news down multiple times throughout that year. 6.	One guy traded for multiple 1st &amp; 2nd rounders. The other guy traded away or wasted 1st &amp; 2nd rounders and even drafted a guy ahead of Kuzma &amp; Hart who was a Eurostash because “we didn’t have the space”. Yes we had Okafor still on the roster after a year of saying he’s going to be traded “for value”. 7.	Hinkie made the draft his main stage. Colangelo kept talking about getting FA’s. We did not land Paul George or LeBron James. 8.	It’s funny to think about but Embiid once had Okafor, Noel &amp; Holmes as backups. BC got him Amir Johnson &amp; Greg Monroe."

"LeBron James grew up in Akron which isn't a great area, and he's black. I think he's going to understand American politics when it comes to systemic racism as a black man from America, a lot better than China."
You have to do better than this though. It’s not really an argument. Why not take an actual argument and attack that rather than this media talk?   To me it looks like you really don’t have a grasp on why people rate James so highly so that must leave you unable to present a detailed opinion on the matter. You could try checking out Ben Taylor’s top 40 page on Lebron to see why someone might rate him top 3. There is no mention of media narratives there.   It’s just better to actually understand the arguments even if you disagree.
"No ones saying what they did is the same, but also no ones saying Lebron should go to jail.  If it's fair to say these cops are monsters, or like Steph Curry decided they ""didn't see George Floyd as human"" based on one unfortunate incident, isn't it also fair to say we shouldn't care what Lebron James thinks because of his one outrageous comment?  Isn't it as likely that Lebron is probanly just self-interested and not a geo-political expert who made a stupid, shitty comment and these guys are probably just sub-standard police officers who made an awful, preventable mistake?  I'm not saying their good people, Im saying we should be willing to accept that Lebron James's ideas about taiwan don't represent his entire being and one 10-minute video doesn't represent these cops entire being either."
Not every player on a playoff team is Lebron James lol. They have bench guys too that maybe only see the court a few times a month
yeah man I don't know if you are aware but Lebron James is a professional basketball player not Martin Luther fucking King.  He does him and you clearly don't like him so what do you want me to tell you?
"Sorry dude, you have an uninformed take. I think most reasonable people would have no issue with Lebron saying nothing on China or holding a passive position (e.g. ""no comment"" or ""I don't know enough about the issue to comment""). But Lebron actively pushed his stance on China and furthermore said Daryl Morey was doing something dangerous and uninformed, which is patently ridiculous. I will paste below his whole quote:  &gt;""I don’t want to get in a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey. But I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke,"" James said before the Lakers’ preseason game against the Golden State Warriors on Monday at Staples Center. ""So many people could have been harmed, not only physically or financially, but emotionally and spiritually. Just be careful what we tweet, what we say and what we do. We do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative things that come with that too  &gt;""I believe he was misinformed or not really educated on the situation,"" James said of Morey. ""If he was, so be it. I have no idea, but that’s my belief. When you say things or do things, you’re doing it and know the things that can be affected by it and the families and individuals that can be affected by it. Sometimes it can be changed as well. Sometimes social media is not a proper way to go about things as well. That’s just my belief."""
"it's this one or ""LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE!"" but really it's Pippen detonating on Ewing's head"
"I think Isiah Thomas said it best when asked a similar question. ""I would take LeBron James as is and add two things, Steph Curry's jumpshot and Kyrie's handles"""
"Lebron James has a 540 million dollar net worth, he should not pretend to be a social justice activist when he wouldn’t give up a few million to stand up for oppressed people. He’s pro social justice when it’s easy and I have no respect for him. Reddit is all eat the rich until we get to athletes who are just as greedy as any other millionaire."

"https://mobile.twitter.com/statmuse/status/1232728255217553408   “Taking it all into account, it's clear why James has a plus-10.4 net rating in a team-high 1,988 minutes, per NBA.com. Only Alex Caruso is higher: plus-11.6 in 993 minutes as an important role player. And it's why the Lakers have a minus-1.0 net rating when James has sat for a total of 902 minutes.  The Lakers win games by 7.5 points per contest. The Bucks are at 12.4, so Antetokounmpo's plus-16.7 net rating is comparatively inflated. That's not a criticism—they are thrashing opponents thanks in large part to their young All-Star.  They, too, are at their worst when Antetokounmpo sits, but the Bucks are still in positive territory at plus-5.2. Perhaps Milwaukee has greater depth and continuity than the Lakers.”   https://www.google.ca/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2879521-lebron-james-mvp-case-cant-be-dismissed.amp.html  Bucks are straight up an all around better team. The lakers go from not even play off level all the way to championship level with Lebron."
"Hawks between 2007 and 2017 were basically a perennial playoff team and only had two losing seasons during that time (still made the playoffs both times). That 60 win season was the peak of the Budenholzer era (he was both HC and their chief executive during that time), and it was a result of the entire team of aging vets playing their best team basketball, being coached to their peak by Bud. Even during the 2016 season where they went 48-34 they were still decent. However both their best seasons during that decade long playoff streak ended at the hands of Lebron James (as did most teams in the East for the 2010s). Combine those harsh sweeps with aging veterans, and you end up with a rebuilding team."
"You can quibble about where that line is exactly, but it’s undeniable that Lebron James, NBA superstar, who is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, is way past that line.  He could not work another day for the rest of his life and his wealth would last several lifetimes.  The bag was secured for him a long time ago.    To act like his personal livelihood or well being was actually hanging in the balance with the HK situation is just totally divorced from reality.  And if that’s the case, it’s not about securing a good life for him and his family; it’s about greed."
"I can remember watching games clearly back to about the 95-96 season. I am basing this post based solely on seasons I actually saw. This is ranked in order.  1. Shaq - Honestly this isn't even close, nobody has been remotely as dominant as Shaq was during his peak years. Nobody else seemed to have teams change their entire rosters to attempt (and miserably fail) to stop him. Nobody was double and triple teamed as much as Shaq was since I've been watching the NBA yet he still dominated. I feel like he has somehow become the most underrated NBA player in modern history as people are somehow ranking Kobe above him sometimes. 2. Michael Jordan - Remember I only watched the second three-peat. I would take Shaq over that period of MJ. I would probably feel different if I saw the crazy athletic Jordan of the late 80s and early 90s. 3. LeBron - Pretty self-explanatory I think. 4. Stephen Curry 5. Kevin Garnett - Ranking him above Duncan is probably controversial but I honestly think he had a better peak but was stuck on worse teams most of his career and especially all through his peak. 6. Tim Duncan - I feel like I am underrating him here but I am rating on peak here, not longevity. 7. Kobe Bryant - I might be underrating him here but I was more impressed with everyone above him. 8. James Harden 9. Kevin Durant 10. Giannis - He will definitely climb this list.  Chris Paul, Wade, Dirk, and Westbrook were toughest cuts."
"LeBron ""China"" James"
"Gil I know you're not going to see this but this fueled my hate for LeBron. I've almost been tossed out of Verizon courtside for trash talking LeBron. He walked in front of you when you had the ball at the free throw line, in the lane, and the refs never called a T cause it's queen James.  Another game you called me over to the bench from courtside but security wouldn't let me through for an autograph. That always stung.  Going to games with my dad to watch you with the wiz are fantastic memories I have from my high school days I'll always remember fondly.  Hope all is well!"
"This feels like betrayal on account of him being my all-time favorite player, but David Robinson.   I think there's some valid reasons for a lot of his under-performance. Namely, in many years it just seemed like he didn't have the supporting cast needed to take the load off his shoulders (or the supporting cast he had didn't show up). Even then, more so than many other stars, Robinson's game as a whole was one that could be more readily stymied without that teammate support.  There's been some games where LeBron James has just gone out and taken it for his squad over the years in ""put-the-team-on-my-back-doe"" fashion. Robinson's game didn't usually have that extra playoff gear ability. As a result, a lot of teams seemed content with doubling him and trying to force his teammates to beat them, which they generally couldn't.   Sometimes I was envious of the guys with Kenny Smith, Penny, Dennis Scott, John Starks, or Robert Horry as sidekicks. Instead, in his prime, Robinson got a Dennis Rodman who'd get himself suspended in the postseason, ignore coach's instructions, refused to help on Hakeem, and sulk in the corner with his shoes off during time-outs. (Apologies in advance to Sean Elliott, which was there each year except '94 and '98 but who also often saw his game dip come playoff time.)"
Being a better scorer isn’t just about how many points one can score but rather in how many ways can a player score and how efficient can he do it.  James harden is a great scorer but can he score in multiple ways like LeBron can in an efficient way? No.  Giannis leads the league in scoring but is he a better scorer than James Harden or Durant? No...

LeBron isn't helping, he's just taking, the only celebrity that wasn't all talk was Nipsey Hustle and he got murdered."
Tough shit for those people. Maybe they can find an advocate other than LeBron James.
"If LeBron James could walk on water, Skip would say it’s because he couldn’t swim."
"A little cartoon of the comment below the break played out in my head, verbatim, the second I saw Beal’s face.   On the subject of Beal’s face in this clip...  It’s not exactly the face of a broken man. It’s the face of a man realizing he wasn’t put together enough to even be broken in the first place.  I recognize the look because I have a mirror in my home. I don’t think about losing to and/or hating LeBron James when I see the look in myself. But that’s neither here nor there.  Anyway, Beal’s version of the look is—to me, apparently—The Look that launched ~100 thought bubbles/word vomit.  Enjoy?  ***    THIS muthafu—nah...NAW...NO...NOPE!    God dam—  Maaaaan...HELL NO!  I swear to God...  I...SWEAR...TO...GAWD!  Lord...LORD...LORD! Please help me, Lord!  Jesus...help me...JESUS...LORD, HELP ME...  LORD JEE-ZAHS!   HELP!...ME!...PLEASE!  BECAUSE THIS MUTHAFUCKA OUT HERE **ON SOME BULLSHIT!**  And Lord...I’m telling You...I can’t...  I JUST...CAN’T...  I...CANNOT!  DEAL...  WITH. THIS. KIND. OF. NONSENSE...  IN. MY. LIFE...  ANY!...  MORE!...  ^(I’m gonna burn this whole damn city down next time muthafucka try that shit again...I wish he would...now he gonna keep going around acting like he more GOAT than Jordan...bitch, please...)   ^(Jordan ain’t have to score no buzzer-beater treys to beat D.C.! He never tried to fool anybody with no doll-head hairline when everybody’s already seen him going bald from like, outer-space, either...)  ^(garbage-ass, big, old, balding, Football-player-looking-ass-sumbitch...need to call my agent though...see if I can get on a team with him when he leaves Cleveland...he still garbage though.)"
"Ray was a winner because he had Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce as his teammates and then he had Lebron James, Dwade, and Chris Bosh as his teammates. Drexler got his team to two finals as the main option and won and won when he got some help with Hakeem"
"Thanks for the level headed discussion. To me, Jordan was a ""better scorer"" only because he didn't involve the team as much as LeBron. LeBron's facilitation goes beyond assists, it's the 3 step ahead, 200 iq plays.  I don't believe the often cited defensive weakness is a real knock against him. Many of the examples people give are bad but they are isolated examples.  I don't think championships matter when you consider the caliber of teams each was playing against. LeBron repeatedly battled the single greatest team in the history of basketball. Jordan battled... James worthy? Clyde Drexler? Sean Kemp? Not that these guys weren't good, but they aren't Stephen curry. And you can point out Barkley and Malone for the Jazz, but those teams weren't as deep as the 2016 warriors, for example."
"Jerry West - Michael Jordan - LeBron James - Kevin Garnett - Bill Russell  There are some great steals here: Jerry West, Dirk, KG, Bill Russell, and Hakeem  Jerry West was primarily a point guard, but van Breda Kolff would run him off ball sometimes before Wilt was there, including running Princeton offense. So I trust Jerry West in running point if LeBron wasn't or playing off ball, which would happen more because I'd prefer LeBron running point. Also defensively, Jerry West was considered one of the best blocking guards (and is probably second only to DWade) and he was an overall very good defender.  Jordan is Jordan. This team has decent spacing outside of Bill Russell, but Jordan would still be able to get to the rim, especially because this team would utilize a lot of motion and screens primarily from KG and Russell. If Russell's man didn't follow him to help on the screen actions, Jordan would get an open midrange which for him was money. Also a great defensive guard.  LeBron James is one of the greatest playmakers and the best volume scorer of the other great playmakers. He also can defend very well when he's locked in and is a very intelligent help defender.  KG can space the floor (shot 45% from long twos, so I think if his career was shifted forward a few years, he would've been able to develop a three point shot at least good enough to make defenders stay close). He is also one of the greatest defenders ever and can help protect the paint but also switch onto perimeter players if necessary.  Russell - The defensive GOAT. He will primarily be there for defensive value, and on offense would help through screens both on ball and off ball."
Yeah why don't we ask the man close to the source Steve Kerr about this..... crickets no nothing. Lebron James is not a saint so holding him ot the standards of one doesn't hold a lot of value or add any value to the discussion.

"True, but conversely, calling out LeBron’s hypocrisy does not mean you don’t support BLM.   BLM ≠ LeBron James"
"I’ll be the first to say that the racist murderers (yep, that’s what they are, police officers or otherwise) of Floyd and Arbery need to be brought to justice. But how exactly is it a straw man? Pointing out that LeBron lacks moral authority to speak here when six short months ago he defended a totalitarian regime and said someone who spoke up in support of pro-democracy protestors who were being brutalized by the Chinese government should “keep his mouth shut” is valid. Pointing out the hypocrisy of LeBron James is not the same as defending the brutality committed against Floyd and Arbrey.   One can be both repulsed by those who defend the murders of Floyd and Arbery and repulsed by LeBron’s defense of a totalitarian regime that murders innocent people daily because he wants to sell sneakers in China. All I hear when LeBron says things like this is that he opposes injustice, but only so long as his opposition doesn’t cost him money."
"&gt; You just pointed out we have the best bench in the league and then point to Luka's on/off numbers..  Not the best but one of the best. Lebron and Giannis have better benches and they have insane on/off numbers.   &gt;Booker literally shot 32 percent from 3 last season  And Booker was seen as an empty stats guy on bad team. If Luka had the team that Trae Young, Booker, or Damian Lillard (this year) has had I think Luka would have a similar reputation and wouldn't be able to carry his team because if he did indeed carry his team they would be a lot higher than 7th seed when his team statistically gets a lead whenever he sits on the bench.  &gt;Five Thirty Eight wrote this great article that explains that while Dallas does have great role players, Luka was playing at a historic level this season for a second year player - https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/luka-doncic-and-the-mavs-are-pushing-the-limits-of-offensive-efficiency/ .  Thanks I will check it out.  &gt;You can call him overrated and try to discredit his role on this team but the numbers/context simply don't support your argument.  I wish I was trolling and I didn't think he was overrated because I hate that I just can't see why I am such a minority on this one. Since Lebron James was 19 years old he has made his team much better at an insane rate. Kawhi Leonard since his early days made the fantastic spurs even better. Giannis for a while now has had great on/off. I get that the Mavs have a great bench but this hasn't stopped historically great ""franchise"" players from having great on/offs that Luka often gets compared to. Luka has an elite bench and head coach and they should get much more credit for their moderate success."
"&gt; If you don't agree that's fine but I'm still going to share clips and my opinion from time to time  No problem, it works both ways. Nothing wrong with having an opinion.   I just find the mythifiying(wrong word to use maybe?) of him odd you likely never saw him play, most of us on this sub wasn't even alive.   You could use the same ""video-clip and testimony"" method with Lebron James to make his athleticism look untouchable if you wanted, too. There're plenty of amazing clips of Orlando Shaq pulling off top-of-backboard blocks and his speed down the court, with the right words and the right clips Shaq can be made out into a superman(heh) with the world's best athleticism.  But again, nothing wrong with having an opinion so all good anyway."
"**Zion** Williams  LeBron **'King' James**  **Christian** Laettner  Billy **Baptist**  **Moses** Malone  Joakim **Noah**  **Stephen Curry**, because he's God"
"Nah you can't get mad at them for that. Everyone can do whatever they want. I'd prefer them to focus on the movement, but if going back to work is beneficial for them then obviously id understand.   Like a guy whos on a vet min contract will obviously want to go back to work because hes not making LeBron James money, he'll need the money. The higher tier players probably don't mind sitting out and partaking in the movement and missing out on the money because they're already swamped in cash as is."
1. Steph Curry  2. Devin Booker   3. Lebron James  4. That Michael dude   5. Charles Barkley  6. Shaq  7. Steve Nash  8. Magic   9. Bird   10. Wilt
Your first mistake is counting Lebron James out
"&gt;Lebron James is racist towards Asians.  One of the dumbest hot takes I've ever read.  You do understand that the Chinese government, that you think Lebron is so supportive of, is made up entirely of Asians right?"
"I kind of agree with what Austin Rivers says.  He agrees with LeBron James' position that there is nothing incompatible with resuming the season while supporting the African-American community.  As Rivers also explains, for many players it is vital that the season resume. They need their full salaries."
"Yeah peak Dwight was insane. Across the 2009 to 2011 seasons, this is a list of the players that polled multiple DPOY first place votes ranked from higher to lowest.      |Player|DPOY 1st Place Votes| :--|:--| |Dwight Howard|329| |LeBron James|8| |Dwyane Wade|3| |Josh Smith|3| |Chuck Hayes|2| |Kevin Garnett|2| |Kobe Bryant|2| |Shane Battier|2| |Thabo Sefolosha|2|.     It's literally not even slightly close."
"&gt; (and Dwight was very much ""better"" than those 2).     He sure was and it's crazy how OP is trying to say that Dwight didn't deserve his 3 DPOY's. He was clearly the best defender in the league at the time. Across the 2009 to 2011 seasons, this is a list of the players that polled multiple DPOY first place votes ranked from higher to lowest.      |Player|DPOY 1st Place Votes| :--|--:| |Dwight Howard|329| |LeBron James|8| |Dwyane Wade|3| |Josh Smith|3| |Chuck Hayes|2| |Kevin Garnett|2| |Kobe Bryant|2| |Shane Battier|2| |Thabo Sefolosha|2|"
"Shaq could’ve gotten the MVP 4 times during his great run, 99-06. He was clearly the best player at that time and won 4 titles during that stretch (5 appearances). He had wins, stats (he led the league/if not was 2nd in PER during that run), and was likable. It really is a head scratcher that Shaq has 1 mvp in his career. The only drawback to Shaq’s resume is injuries, but that’s it.   The only other player that comes to kind as of late is Lebron James circa 09-14. Only the league actually awarded him the mvp award 4 times, yet he only won 2 titles in that span."
 LeBron James is just three Isaiah Thomas' stacked on top of each other in a Lakers' jersey.
"They have something you don't LEVERAGE......when or if you get to the top of whatever profession you are in things change.   You are replaceable Lebron James is not. You tell your boss your not coming in you are fired and he doesn't care Lebron says he is not coming in Adam Silver is calling him 10 minutes later asking ,"" what can I do"""
"And I agree. Chris Paul, LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, et al. need to get out on the streets with the people. March, shout, demand change. This is not the time for spouting sports cliches like ""one game at a time"" ""we just have to stay focused"" ""every one of us left it all out there"" ""just gotta get better"" in post-game interviews. If you're a person who actually think the guys playing and wearing BLM gear at practices and games is more authentic and sends a message of ""fight"" more than them protesting, marching, speaking out for victims, etc. and generally being a voice on the front lines of the movement...are just tone-deaf and situated too deeply in the pockets of wealth/power and business interests."
Lebron james going to be the next billionaire athlete after Michael Jordan...Kobe Bryant spoke 4 languages / played in the most complex offensive system a NBA can run....so lets not question their intelligence cause they didn't receive an academic education....The average paycheck of an NBA player greatly increased from the deal those 4 negotiated....so yea they were the correct ppl in that room
Dude the two sentences right before the quote are:  &gt; James reportedly was not on the Friday call. The Athletic reported he wants to continue to play while also being a voice for social change.  Author was definitely trying to pull some weird stuff by positioning the quote as he did. Obviously we know LeBron wants the season to resume but the author made it seem like that specific quote was said after Kyrie's call.
"You're lying, this is the full quote in order of how it appears in the article:  &gt; The sport’s strongest voice and most recognizable face, LeBron James, is reportedly leading the fight in favor of finishing the season. Earlier in the week, James announced the formation of a voting rights group, along with Hawks guard Trae Young, in hopes of increasing black voter turnout and ending black voter suppression. James reportedly was not on the Friday call. The Athletic reported he wants to continue to play while also being a voice for social change.  &gt; “Because of everything that’s going on, people are finally starting to listen to us,” James told the New York Times. “We feel like we’re finally getting a foot in the door. How long is up to us. We don’t know. But we feel like we’re getting some ears and some attention, and this is the time for us to finally make a difference.”  He makes it seem as if he dropped that quote after the Friday all"
An interesting thought would be who the Rockets would have selected with the 2002 number one overall pick; Yao Ming (who they actually selected) or a *16* year old LeBron James. I think at the time Ming still would have gone first (Shaq was running the league and the WC foe would likely have taken the big bodied center)  Leaving the Chicago Bulls LeBron James.....what a world we could be living in right now
"The author put that later in the article and put it in context (ie that the quote came earlier in the week):  &gt;The sport’s strongest voice and most recognizable face, LeBron James, is reportedly leading the fight in favor of finishing the season. Earlier in the week, James announced the formation of a voting rights group, along with Hawks guard Trae Young, in hopes of increasing black voter turnout and ending black voter suppression. James reportedly was not on the Friday call. The Athletic reported he wants to continue to play while also being a voice for social change."
LeBron James leading the pushback against Kyrie Irving’s pushback against LeBron James’ support for he NBA League Office plan to resume season.
"I didn’t mean to imply that they’d die in 6 weeks. Re-ignite meant to add fuel to the fire. Every team coming out with “ I can’t breathe” shirts will get the nation talking. Every media outlet in the world will have to cover that when they’re currently trying to act like protests are dad. People like Laura Ingraham are salivating at the chance to get their veiled anti-black rhetoric off.   Sports are an incredibly powerful thing. Even the nfl is handling all of this relatively well so just imagine what the nba and it’s player are gonna do. I’m positive there will be massive shows of unity. Kneeling, shirts, post game interviews, all that.  Some of the most famous people in the world will have their platforms amplified. I don’t see how that’s going to take away attention from a movement that the powers that be are trying to kill. They won’t be able to ignore it when lebron James and giannis take a stand with the whole world watching."
"No offense but the school some of these players go to does not equate to intelligence level.  This kind of talk reminds me of when the few basketball players didn't like that jeremy linn had his hair braided, when they were are wearing asian tattoos.  Or when lebron james try's to speak on social issues but pretty much flat out talks about how the chinese have consequences for having rights."
"One time Paul Pierce, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James and Kevin Garnett negotiated with the NBA. One year of academic education among them four combined."
"Because a large portion of this sub doesn't wanna hear that Lebron James is a massive hypocrite, and quite probably racist towards Asians.    Imagine if a player came out and told someone they're misinformed and uneducated for supporting BLM, and that they're only thinking about themselves for supporting it. Because that's essentially what he did with Morey.    That player would be labeled a racist by this entire subreddit."
"If someone in this current climate came out and told someone else they're misinformed and uneducated for supporting BLM, they would be labeling him a racist and plastering it all over social media. So ill just use the same rhetoric.    **Lebron James is racist towards Asians.**    Worse of all, is that he had the audacity to tell Morey ""you’re only thinking about yourself."" when Morey supported the protests.    Lebron's hypocrisy is next level.   He's a great basketball player on the court, but as a person he's a fake."
“Big shoutout to this guy ^  for thinking LeBron James would have been executed.  lol”  This is you.
Big shoutout to this guy ^  for thinking LeBron James would have been executed.  lol
At the end of the day he’s just a basketball player...  [LMAO](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1zembXyrxK1RkHFCcq6AQCVXaY/LeBron-James-t-shirt-LeBron-James-LA-T-shirt-More-Than-An-Athlete-Letter-Print-Tee.jpg)
"Mmm... no.   &gt; “Nearly a week ago today, in a Shanghai hotel room, or Shanghai hotel ballroom, Adam Silver got up and addressed the players, and **LeBron James is one of the players who got up and spoke and said, ‘Hey, what are we doing here? Daryl Morey made these statements,’” McMenamin recalled on air Tuesday. “You know damn well if a player made the same statements and caused such poor ramifications for the league, there would be some sort of league recourse or repercussions that the player has to pay.**  &gt; “**Potentially this tweet could cost the league hundred of millions of dollars, which could come out of the players’ pockets — so that was the double-standard that was being addressed in that meeting.**”  It was all about the money."
Not even about what he said about Morey. [He was lobbying Silver to punish Morey for the tweet.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/clutchpoints.com/lakers-news-lebron-james-pressured-adam-silver-to-punish-rockets-gm-daryl-morey-for-controversial-tweet/amp/)
"Austin Rivers is an African American, LeBron James is an African American, most players are for playing rather than not. Not sure how you can really say that when there's clearly disagreement over which approach would be better"
"There's a difference between saying... as you put it, ""shit up and dribble"", and saying what LeBron James, Austin Rivers, and others are saying, and things that players like Russell Westbrook support, which is that they can use the platform they'd have while playing to their advantage while fighting for the cause.  The fact that we've already seen players fighting for the cause who have also been vocal about wanting to play kind of crushes your dumbass theory on the spot."
I just don't buy for a second that getting rid of their platform is the best path for advocacy. LeBron James advocating for black votes to be protected  and for black people to register and check their registration would do more than the entire league just bailing.  I honestly think bailing would have a net negative effect for social justice.
"I don’t see how other people don’t understand this.  People will definitely talk about it, as in “hey did you hear the NBA players cancelled the season because of the protests?” And that will literally be it. Guys like Lou Will and Kyrie are acting like people are gonna be in the streets banging down the doors of the White House just because they decided not to play ball, lmao. Unless LeBron James is out there getting tear gassed and beat down like everyone else, this is not actually going to make more of a difference than continuing to play and talking about the issues."
"“Fuck them kids”  LeBron James, probably."
I don’t want to get into a feud with LeBron James but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke.
"They may not be great shooters, but they are both great scorers.   Giannis is putting up 55/31/63 but that equates to 61% TS (similar to James Harden, Anthony Davis).   Luka is putting up 46/32/75 but that equates to 58% TS (similar to LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard).  If you surround these two drive-and-kick defender-magnets with good shooters I have zero doubt they would be the #1 offence in the league. Dallas already has Seth Curry shooting 45% on 5.1 3PA, Tim Hardaway shooting 41% on 7.2 3PA, JJ Barea shooting 38% on 2.9 3PA, and a 7'3 unicorn shooting 35% on 7.1 3PA."
"It's important to remember positions change based on trends. ""Small Ball"" worked for several reasons:  1) it exploited a weakness of the previous dominant strategy by forcing rim protectors to guard on the perimeter more, neutralizing a lot of their impact  2) the league had the personnel to use it. Without guys like Lebron James and Draymond Green who could guard above their position, small ball never would've caught on  3) the league lacked the personnel to counter it. Small Ball has a clear weakness, skilled bigs. Between 2012 and 2019, the most relevant big man in the playoffs was...Lamarcus Aldridge? From Dirk's decline to Giannis's rise, there just weren't big men in the later rounds of the playoffs that could use their size to punish teams that sacrificed interior defense for offensive versatility.  None of these are true about small ball going forward. Teams like the Bucks, Celtics, and Clippers are specifically designed to beat small ball, as of now we don't see the players with the elite defensive versatility to make it work, and even if we did, guys like Giannis, Embiid, AD, and Jokic would make you pay for it, and that's only going to get worse if guys like KAT, Ayton, and Zion get into the playoffs.  Predicting league trends is hard, but it looks like the next one is going to be all about exploiting the flaws of small ball. We're going to see more teams built around 2 way bigs and less teams that feature traditional point guard, opting in favor of combo wings like Luka Doncic, Lamelo Ball, Cade Cunningham, we'll see if this actually happens, but if it does, Edwards could get pushed more towards being a point guard, it'd maximize his value as an on ball defender, minimize his off ball weaknesses, and positions are dead on offense so you can just put him next to a point forward that handles running the offense (not suggesting it's easy to find an elite point forward, but it's a possibility)."
"No one notices LeBron James in the off season? I didn't know their only value comes when entertaining you.   This comment is absurd. The NFL isn't playing right now and people are noticing things they say. Even Trump responded to an NFL player. Yet you think nobody will notice what players say unless they are currently playing. It is just so factually wrong I'm amazed you said it out loud, let alone think it."
"So perhaps Kyrie should take note from those who keep their mouths shut and listen, learn, understand before speaking. You don't see Chris Paul or LeBron James deviate from their message, because they make informed and calculated statements. Kyrie just speaks whatever comes to his mind, ends up either having to defend something stupid he says or stand strong on something he said that he doesn't even really believe!  *(such as his flat earth thing for example)*"
This would mean something if there was a comparison to non Lebron James team trades.
"Well I guess we have a difference of opinion in rapidly changing information.  Has there been some new information/scandal/protests that has come out in the last week?  It would be one thing if Kyrie voted before the George Floyd thing, before the protests, etc., but that's not what happened.  The players (Kyrie among them) voted yes on 6/5 to restart the league.  This was a week after players like Jaylen Brown, Enes Kanter, Lonzo Ball, Tobias Harris, Jordan Clarckson, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Justin Jackson, Jalen Brunson, and I'm sure many others attended protests.  Then on 6/12 Kyrie gets up in front of everybody saying they should sit out?  Sure Kyrie can change his mind, but what was the new information or circumstance that changed it?  To me (a salty Celtics fan, so maybe I'm just biased) it comes off more like Kyrie being two faced rather than a change of heart.  [And that's what it sounds like based on what Woj wrote:](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29304500/sources-kyrie-irving-play-key-role-friday-call-players)  &gt; So, yes, it surprised several of his NBPA colleagues that Irving -- lost for the season with shoulder surgery in March -- was simultaneously lending his voice to a far different discussion with rank-and-file union members on upending the league's plans for a 22-team restart at Disney World in Orlando, sources said.  &gt;. . .  &gt;Irving, 28, has forged a reputation as a disruptor within his career, and that's emerging again at this crucial moment for the NBA. Irving's stance has pitted him against the league's establishment, including his former Cavaliers teammate LeBron James, once again. There's significant support to resume the season among the league's superstars -- most of whom are on playoff contenders -- and Irving seems to be relishing the clash."
"There have always been many things that are more important than basketball. I ask this question honestly, and without sarcasm, because I want to understand how people feel: What makes this moment in time unique, such that starting basketball (or football, or baseball, etc) more dangerous?  I'm sympathetic to the ""bread and circuses"" viewpoint because I completely believe that people will use any distraction from move on from thinking about issues that make them angry or uncomfortable. But I don't think cancelling the NBA removes the ""circus"" part, and I honestly do not think these players will be able to achieve much without this platform. You cancel the season, and perhaps the next, and a whole lot of white folks are going to just stop caring what LeBron James or Kyrie Irving or \[insert superstar\] have to say about anything."
"Yes, Lebron James, the most famous player in the league, is already famous. But what about all the young rising stars that I mentioned in my previous comment? Are they not allowed to have the opportunity to elevate their profile by proving themselves? Or do they just supposed to be content to sit back while the Lebrons and Kyries of the league speak for them?"
"Hes effectively the size of James Harden... so size wise he can play whatever Harden/Gordon are doing.  He’s bigger than Norm Powell who sees minutes with two guys smaller than him on the court.  He’d have to learn how to use that size and strength, of course, and you wouldn’t want him isolated on LeBron.  But I’m not sure why anyone is saying he can’t just because he’s “too small”"
"They should absolutely not play. The only reason they want to play is to get paid and look out for themselves.   Look at the ambassador Lebron James, who wants to play and “try to go on a run”. Or, he’s just looking to collect on his fat sum of remaining salary. He’s the biggest hypocrite ever. He criticized Daryl Morey over his support for Hong Kong even though it’s a very similar situation to what is happening in America. Morey stands in support of HK independence but that cost LBJ money so Morey is “misinformed”. Now the same situation goes on and he forms a group to tackle the issues which is good, but he still wants to play????  Even the NBA is handling this wrong by trying to revive the season just to make money off of the players."
"I'm sure everyone can picture the league running a HUGE BLM campaign throughout the playoffs. Jersey badges, shirts, player interviews to the background of piano music. I think it'll be beautiful in terms of keeping the focus on our battle for true civil rights in this country.   Imagine how iconic it will be for future generations if LeBron James and Anthony Davis hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy together in one hand, and hold the other hand out in a fist, or jus kneel with the trophies. Of course, I'll be rooting with every fiber in my being that the Lakers get eliminated in the first round, along with the Rockets. Ha ha ha sports"
"&gt;we're just a distraction  That's the whole counter point that so many are willfully ignoring. People pretend like there isn't a considerable overlap between NBA viewers and protesters, which they will effectively be distracting by playing months of non-stop basketball. I bet Trump is giddy at the prospect. Wearing BLM hashtags on their shoes and giving exhausted post game interviews won't be half as effective as something like Chris Paul marching in the street or Lebron James doing a series of interviews on CNN would be.  Besides, a lot of people use platforms like Reddit and Twitter as news aggregates rather than sitting down and turning on Fox News directly. For those people highlights of Kawhi's buzzer beater in triple OT or Caruso's monster dunk absolutely displace news about the protests. It's happening right now with memes about the PS5/GTAV flooding /r/all."
"I mean this whole outrage and reaction is ridiculous when you realize that this is a police union problem, not a white racist problem. The Me Too movement pulled the same shit when they tried to make all men responsible for the crimes of Harvey Weinstein and the dynamics in Hollywood that allowed Weinstein to keep doing what he was doing when a regular man like me could never relate to being in Weinstein's position or to being that much of a pervert.  Sports and politics are becoming too intertwined these days. And I don't think it's in the NBA's best interest to have noted Chinese Communist Party sympathizer LeBron James lecture the public about social issues (that doesn't mean he won't give it his best shot, unfortunately)."
*LeBron James has entered the chat*
"That's revisionist history right there.  Peak Wall was clearly better than peak Lowry.  Last time Wall was healthy, he averaged 27 and 10 in the playoffs and he was the best player in the eastern conference not named LeBron James.  Obviously Lowry had the better decade overall, since Wall got fucked by injuries, but peak for peak nobody in their right minds would take Lowry over Wall."
TIL Lebron James is a cartel boss.
&gt;sole efforts of lebron james  nobody is carrying a team that has another player averaging 27 points on elite efficency

Despite these subs game 6 Klay memes it will always be a conversation as long as LeBron James is in the league.... oh and his fucking teammate steph curry
James Naismith -&gt; Phog Allen -&gt; Wilt Chamberlain -&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -&gt; Reggie Miller -&gt; LeBron James  So there's the origin of the NBA to the face of the league over 129 years later in just six people.
"Remember how Lebron, Maverick Carter, and 2K thought it would be a good idea to center the My Career story around bolster who was an activist(he barely was at that) *like* Lebron James, putting the issues he cares about first in life?  I wonder which of the three regret doing that the most?"
"He has been, but mostly by the news media. He [pushed for the 'over 36 rule' to be changed to 'over 38'](https://www.businessinsider.com/nba-cba-changed-over-36-rule-lebron-james-200-million-contract-2016-12?op=1) when it stood to directly benefit himself and LBJ, even though it would eat up cap space on teams and force them to have less money available for younger players.  [He also opposed cap smoothing after the revenue spike](https://www.si.com/nba/2015/03/12/nba-nbpa-smoothing-salary-cap-labor-crisis-lockout-2017), which directly contributed to the GSW being able to afford to sign KD. How strange, considering that CP3 and LBJ both had options of becoming FA during 2016.  CP3 is a smart guy, but he has been absolutely shitty has an NBAPA President. He is selfish and uses the position only to do things to benefit himself and his friends. LBJ was VP so there's that too.  Either way, they do not represent what is best for players overall. Good leadership would be looking out for the two players and min contract guys and trying to make sure the playing field was fair for everyone. Not these guys. Selfish assholes."
"Dr. Fauci: “Not only am I confident the NBA’s plan to return is safe, but I’m also confident that the epic Cavs title win from 2016 was all thanks to the sole efforts of LeBron James.”"
"No it's not   LeBron James sells out buildings across America, sells merch and brings in mega sponsorships   If we wanna give Alex Caruso more money, then I hope people have the same reaction if WNBA players ask for money (they won't.)"
"Lebron James is better than Jordan. He's bigger, stronger, faster, a better passer, rebounder, a more efficient scorer, and can play and defend 1-4 and sometimes 5. He also doesn't punch his white teammates in the face."
lebron james because the average 90s player wouldnt be in the d-league today.

LEBRON JAMES HAS A FAMILY
Lmao you are clueless and obviously didn't watch the NBA that season. Wade was still a monster in 2011 and he was the Heat's best player in the Finals while being equally as dominant as LeBron in the previous rounds (He was also a much better player than Dirk in 2011).   I'm not going to waste my time arguing with someone who thinks James Jones and Dwyane Wade is a valid comparison.
Yea man it’s not like LeBron was 3rd in MVP or anything. The point still stands that saying Wade was in these finals is diminished because the best player in the world took him there. So for this argument yes we can compare him to James Jones as it would be a similar stat to bring up
"""Fuck this guy for wanting to discuss human rights""  LeBron James in reference to Daryl Morey's Hong Kong comments"
Imagine comparing Dwyane Wade with James Jones lol.   Wade didn't make the finals cause of his teammates in 2006 and in 2011 he was still a top 3 player in the NBA. Him and LeBron both played their part in taking that Miami team to the Finals. There's no reason we should put Dirk there instead of Wade and I don't even know why we are having this discussion in the first place.
"May I direct you to yahoo comments, sir? Some people hate Lebron James like it’s their life."

"Ahhh I feel some deep rooted tensions with this post. Kinda shrouded but I’ll Give you benefit of the doubt.    Andrew Bynum iirc was the last prep to pro player to be drafted. In 2005. 15 years ago. Of the top of my head other players include Lue Will or Lebron James, but they’re not heads of the NBPA.    More so, The players themselves (within the US) are all required to attend at least 1 season of college. Current rules may have changed, but that’s how it has been for the most part.    Furthermlre, players like Brogdon and Jaylen Brown are also more educated than that, whether it be through staying all 4 years, or taking masters level courses.    So I ask you, how did you come upon the conclusion that they were “high school graduates”??  🤔🤔🤔👌🏽"
He’s just saying Dirk didn’t make the finals because of his teammates unlike those 4 years from Wade. Imagine using James Jones for a list like this. It would just show he played with LeBron a lot. I think that was the message.
I'm totally good with James sitting this out. And LeBron and Giannis too. Jokic and Mitchell should also wait until next year.   I think Kawhi and PG seem good to go. Strictly medical opinion.

"LeBron James has access to some very powerful resources. If it takes him a decade to recoup that money so be it. And Yes Nike could implode, yes China could end up blocking the NBA, but if China can already do that, we have bigger problems at hand don't we now."
"&gt;LeBron James has no obligation to speak about China  There has been a giant messaging push in the last week or two that ""silence is violence"" and that if you don't speak up you're part of the problem."
LeBron James has no obligation to speak about China. Quit trying to attack his character and credibility while he's trying to make change for his own people.
Yeah just like everyone moved on from Muhammed Ali.  The whole sports world is just going to move on from LeBron James and Steph Curry. You've got it dude.

"&gt;  It's an incredibly dumb take, when you consider they can create MORE EXPOSURE through basketball.

This isn't about creating more exposure though about the movement....."

"I think a lot of NBA fans that don't live in cities with teams, myself included, have a few players they support rather than a specific team. Watch people like Lebron, Giannis, James Harden, Luka, Zion, etc... and see who's style of play you like to watch. If you do want a team to follow and root for, I would suggest jumping on the early bandwagon of one of the younger talented team like Dallas, New Orleans, or Memphis."
lol no one cares what some random darius miller wants. its up to chris paul and lebron james.
That’s a fair point but I always thought that was little bit of a stretch. I feel like Gilbert was just upset he lost lebron James for his basketball team and let his emotions get the better of him.  I didn’t think he was viewing lebron as a runaway slave
"I think it’s fair when you consider the consistency of LeBron James. Where ever he plays teams do well. Sure his first year with the lakers didn’t have the greatest outcome, but that was an injury ridden year."
"Hmm.

You're right, what could it possibly be that makes people ""lose their minds"""

"The spurs are something like Manchester United after fergie left, except their long time coach (since the late ninties) is still there but all the talent left. 2 years ago they were strong armed by their best player and one of the top players in the league into trading him and now theres a good chance they miss the playoffs for the first time in 20 years (the longest stretch in the league.   The NBA is a much more superstar driven league and therefore while the top teams do tend to change places that are already good or are cities that people want to be in tend to be better. Teams like Minnesota, New York Knicks, Charlotte Hornets, and a few others have been consistently bad for most of their existence with only a few pockets here and there of being decent. My Raptors were for years considered one of the worst teams in the league but in the last 5-6 years have turned it around and are currently the defending champs because we were the team the spurs traded their best player to. He only stayed one year but he won a chip.   Theres no relegation in the NBA as you probably already know, I completely get why but imo it hurts competitiveness because teams are motivated to be as bad as possible for extended periods of time because the worse you are the higher your draft pick. The problem is bad teams often are bad for a reason and if you cant scout and develop players properly having top picks wont make a huge deal of difference unless you fluke into getting an all time great player like Lebron James."
"Lebron James. Physical freak. I was three rows up at the game on the opposite side of the court when he basically murdered Nurkic with that dunk. I’ve been going to Blazer games for twenty years and never, ever heard that crowd reaction before or since.  Iverson a distant second."
LeBron James. He was playing the spurs and he had a break away dunk and I swear even tho it was a away game for him once he jumped to dunk it the whole arena stood still and quiet and swear he was in the air for minutes. Will never forget how awesome that moment was
Cavs should think about retiring LeBron James jersey
I think Draymond is saying something essential about LeBron James.  He is indeed the most disciplined player in NBA history.  To be able to do what he does at almost 36 years old shows that he has been dedicated to his sport for as long as few have been able to do it for as long.
"He's a master of make up calls in garbage time, and then make up calls in other games with that team. There are at least three specific teams who he screwed over in the playoffs like this, and at the end of the game he could say ""what? both teams threw the same amount of free throws"" when one team got a 15 point lead and the other had its two best defensive players had 3 fouls after 10 minutes on the floor and couldn't touch the opposing offense the rest of the game.  There are ways you call superstars. For instance, any 50/50 foul involving LeBron James will never be whistled on James. Every time James and another player both hack someone, it's whistled on the other player. That does not hold true for players he does not favor, and holds extra-true for players he does. And it always seems, by pure coincidence, to extend the series."
People wondering why everybody is hype down 40 even with the guy airballing like Lebron fucking James didn’t just get crossed over
"Some of y'all don't like fun, talking about it's not a real cross because he airballed. But let's be real you're a kid playing against LeBron fucking James, and that building is popping we're all missing that shot too lol. For me atleast, if I'm in a 5 mile radius and LeBron trips and falls. I'm telling everyone I ever met I crossed LeBron, and that shits going straight on my tinder bio LMAO"

"&gt; hiring “The Sopranos” actors James Gandolfini and Edie Falco for it  Like just for them to show up? They weren't really massive celebrities at the time. The Sopranos had been over for years at that point.  ...or like to be in character? Since it's both of them I kind of think it could be this. Gandolfini was good, but would LeBron care about Edie Falco the person?"
So your mad because im not doing anything for china but dont care lebron james isnt either?  &amp;#x200B;  Ok dude
"?  PG was at his peak as a Pacer, that was the year before his injury &amp; DG didnt really play that year or the year before.    Wade was better than a lot of team's 1st options, same as Bosh.  Allen was still a 3pt sniper, Battier was huge in MEM beating SA in 2011, Andersen was still an elite shot blocker, Miami is a good franchise too, they're one of the most successful franchises in NBA history.    Kawhi was essentially a rookie in his 2nd year (lockout player) when he put up 15 &amp; 10 against Lebron &amp; took him 7, even with TP injured, he nearly closed him out with 19-16 in G7.  The next year he bulked up, got better, and demolished James, again with TP injured.  I think it stands to reason that Kawhi is better.  James was in his prime, Kawhi was not, Kawhi still got the W &amp; continues to widen the gap.  And LBJ stat padded, that's just the reality, he only took 18 shots a game, 20+ against GS."
They read LeBron James and thought it was Jamón Games  the rest is history
"&gt;2011	Dallas Mavericks	Lebron James had the worst performance of his career, an anomaly   I can understand calling injuries as asterisks, but this is an ASS-terisk  come on, he choked, Dallas deserved it  I understand the point of the post, but this is just stupid"
"&gt;Yeah, just say some names with no context. 2011 Celtics with Allen-Garnett-Shaq-Pierce-Jermaine are the best team ever, right?  Who exactly had a better supporting cast than Lebron in 2011?    &gt;How is James supposed to win when his second best player goes 15.2/3.8/2.6 on 43/33/69?   How are the Heat supposed to win when LBJ is just standing on the court, not doing anything in the flow of the game while Kawhi is dropping 17ppg on 60%?  Where was his defense at?    &gt;Yes, because everybody except LeBron played well. Opposite situation in 2014.  He didn't play well lol, it'd be one thing if LBJ scored these points in the flow of the game but he didn't.  Games are all about momentum, those momentum killing shots are the most difficult, not the blow out, no pressure situations.   Btw game 3 iirc?  Kawhi got subbed early due to foul trouble, Lebron exploded on SA for 21st qtr points &amp; gave MIA the lead.  Kawhi checks back in, Lebron goes something like 20 mins scoring 3pts &amp; MIA loses the lead.  We can literally see the difference with &amp; without Kawhi.  We saw that in 2017.  We saw that before he got to the Spurs, we saw this against Giannis, etc.  It's multiple years of doing the same thing on different teams, with different coaches, different players."
"&gt; Wade-Bosh-Allen-Battier-Anderson etc. Are bad players now smh.  Yeah, just say some names with no context. 2011 Celtics with Allen-Garnett-Shaq-Pierce-Jermaine are the best team ever, right? How is James supposed to win when his second best player goes 15.2/3.8/2.6 on 43/33/69?   &gt; The 2011 Finals were competitive  Yes, because everybody **except** LeBron played well. Opposite situation in 2014.  We'll see what happens in these playoffs."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Michael Jordan.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched MJ in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Michael's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the greatest SG ever, and the best player to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Michael Jordan, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Jordan in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Jordan is better.  You might be jealous of Jordan's six rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Jordan isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Jordan talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Lmao I guess Wade-Bosh-Allen-Battier-Anderson etc. Are bad players now smh.  You literally ignored James going scoreless an average of 10 mins at a time shifting all the blame onto MIA, how tf are they supposed to win when he's taking entire quarters off.  The 2011 Finals were competitive, these were not, Lebron probably would've put up similar or worse stats if he approached that series like he did this one.  Answering someone's shot with a shot of your own just isnt the same as waiting towards the end of the quarter in blowout situations.     As I said, Lebron has 1 win over Kawhi in the last 4 years, the last time he beat him it took 57 from Irving.  Kawhi has shut down James on multiple occasions throughout the years with different teams &amp; lesser personnel.  He has a winning record against him in the playoffs &amp; regular season."
"You had to watch the games, there's only so much a box score can show you.    A team cant win the Finals unless their superstar shows up, LBJ didn't show up.  There's 2 sides of the coin to this, MIA was giving Lebron touches, they ran plays for him, set screens, decoys etc. Every single time Lebron was like ""nope"".  So if you're giving this person all your support &amp; they're not doing anything with it, how are you to blame?    Lebron played the GS-Spurs series completely differently, he was more aggressive against GS &amp; pulled put the W, nearly did it twice.  It's not even that series alone it's been their whole careers, Kawhi has gotten the better of him since 2014, there's been games like this year where Lebron was held to like 2pts in the 4th Q.  The last W James got against Kawhi was his 1st in 4 years that's how 1 sided this has been."
LeBron James..
The Raptors owner has too.   https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/lebron-james-voting-rights-organization
"OKC had SA's number but Kawhi made those series &amp; games competitive, in 2016 they were essentially down the big 3 &amp; still they pushed it to 6 games &amp; Adams-Kanter still had to bail OKC out, that series was won on the boards.   Lbj was a non-factor because of how bad his teams lost which is a direct result of his passiveness.  You can take any superstar, put him in the game when the opponent is up 20, foot off the gas with subpar defenders &amp; they'd do what James did.  And Diaw?  Diaw has never been a defender let alone a Lebron stopper.   Game 4, 1st Q, LBJ didn't pick up his first points until 3 mins into the quarter on Splitter/Diaw, Heat losing.  2nd Q, LBJ doesn't score until 3 mins left again, MIA down 18.  Lebron hits a buzzer beater 3 with 11 secs.    Spurs up 20.  Game over.    3rd Q LBJ comes out aggressive but by this point the Spurs are up 20+, they've taken their foot off the pedal.    The whole series was like this.  LBJ was passive in the thick of things but once things became relaxed that's when he exploded for his bunches of points.  Any superstar can do that in a blowout situation, points in a blowout are pretty much irrelevant."

"&gt; For LeBron not to understand what he was doing -- or even worse, not to care -- made me quickly turn off the television, find my kids, give them their nightly bath and try to forget the sports atrocity that I had just witnessed. He just couldn't have handled it worse. Never in my life can I remember someone swinging from likable to unlikable that quickly. I will forgive him some day because I like watching him play basketball, and whether you're rooting for or against him, his alliance with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami created one the greatest ""Holy s---, how is this going to play out?????"" scenarios in recent sports history. Sports are supposed to be fun, and eventually, this will become fun -- for everyone but people in Cleveland -- because we finally have a Yankees of basketball.  &gt; But I will never, ever, not in a million years, understand why it had to play out that way. If LeBron James is the future of sports, then I shudder for the future.  Lol"

It was the same before the expansion - so you can imagine how much worse it got after the 3 expansion drafts in 89, 90 and 95. (YES - there were THREE expansions during MJ years...) Just imagine 6 new teams drafting players from other teams some of which were already pretty bad to begin with. Not saying it’s a definitive argument, but it’s ridiculous to say it didn’t happen or it’s just the same as having bad teams.  Also, not sure where you get your ELO ratings from but 2015 to 2017 Warriors teams all 3 have higher ELO rankings than the 2 Jazz teams. Then you have the Jazz 98 and 97. And guess what? The next 6 finals opponents with highest ELO rankings were all LeBron’s opponents. It’s just undeniable that LeBron faced much tougher competition in the finals. It’s just a fact.  Ps: here is a good read for you with some actual data:   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportingnews.com/au/amp/nba/news/the-last-dance-did-michael-jordan-or-lebron-james-face-tougher-competition-in-the-playoffs/1pa258wqpqks118w1ph2bg1rj0"
Wade would've came with LeBron. The big roadblock was Bosh and the Bulls weren't able to afford all three. They tried to trade Deng to clear cap space and they had a suitor in the Clippers but the Clippers backed out before accepting so the Bulls had to settle for trying to just get James and Wade and the rest is history
"I recall reading somewhere that the Heat took advantage of a salary cap loop hole that allowed LeBron, Wade, and Bosh to recoup much their ""pay cut"" as bonuses.      Maybe someone more knowledgeable about the Heat can confirm or refute?    EDIT: Here's what I found on Google:  &gt; For most of the past decade, that meant exploiting unlikely incentives. This was a strategy popularized by the Miami Heat during the summer of 2010. In the previous season, they had won only 47 games. But with LeBron James, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade signing up during the offseason, it could be safely assumed that they would win more a year later.  &gt; &gt;The fact that they didn't during the 2009-10 season, though, allowed the Heat to build hilariously low unlikely incentives into the contracts of their superstars. Up to 15 percent of a player's salary can be based on unlikely incentives, so the Heat set such an incentive into the contracts of Wade, James and Bosh. The criterion that needed to be met? The Heat had to win 48 games.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/how-rockets-manipulated-the-salary-cap-to-create-a-trade-asset-out-of-thin-air-become-favorites-for-andre-iguodala/"
"&gt; Acting like JJ Barea guarded LeBron James for any significant period in the 2011 Finals is preposterous but people pretend that he got ""locked down"" anyways.  lmao, those kids dont even know basic defensive scheme or even a 2-3 zone."
“I believe u/BrettGardner-Caillou wasn’t educated on the situation at hand.”  - LeBron James
"Dumb fucks will take one or two blunders and craft an entire narrative around it. Acting like JJ Barea guarded LeBron James for any significant period in the 2011 Finals is preposterous but people pretend that he got ""locked down"" anyways."
1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Luka Doncic 4. Damian Lillard 5. Russell Westbrook 6. Kyrie Irving 7. Trae Young 8. Chris Paul 9. Ben Simmons 10. Kyle Lowry
Let me clarify (before LeBron James)
"Klutch sports Team adding depth  PG- Ben Simmons, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe  SG- Trae Young, Anthony Edwards  SF- Lebron James  PF- Anthony Davis, Draymond Green  C- Jusuf Nurkic"
75% or LeBron James... Whichever comes first.
Why do so many people incorrectly say Michael Jordan and Lebron James sucked at basketball? They in fact did NOT suck. Let me prove it to you with these FACTS.
LeBron James Harden   Chris Paul George
"He has improved every year regardless of his team's situation though, even prior to this year. For example, in his third year he had Bledsoe replaced by Tyler Ulis, Mike James, Shaq Harrison, and Elfrid Payton and still improved in all meaningful stats. Unless you're saying that the Suns progressively improved their roster year to year over his tenure, which I would *definitely* disagree with.  Also I'm pretty surprised that even a 64 TS% at his volume wouldn't change your ranking. For context, at 18 FGA/g the only people in NBA history to clear that mark are Steph Curry and Adrian Dantley in their prime years. Even at 63% you only add Kevin Durant. Drop the attempts to 16 and you're introducing names like Lebron, Giannis, and Barkley. That would be a pretty incredible bar to clear and not be impressed by."
"Well, it is close.  Oden is in that conversation too.  But Bates is absolutely considered in that league.  He's the first sophomore ever to win National HS POY.  ESPN ranked him as tied for 3rd for best prospect since Lebron -- tied with AD, actually.  Oden and Durant as top 2 (https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/insider/story/_/id/27332999/why-15-year-old-emoni-bates-basketball-next-phenomenon, or this if you don't have insider:https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/08/emoni-bates-tied-for-third-in-espn-ranking-of-prospects-since-lebron-james.html.  It's really not absurd to say he's possibly the best prosepct since Lebron -- not definitively, but he's 100% in that discussion.  Another article by 247:  https://247sports.com/college/basketball/recruiting/Article/LeBron-James-Emoni-Best-Best-High-School-Player-131961604/    I honestly think you're not giving him enough credit by saying ""he's not close to AD as a prospect.""  That is absolutely a minority opinion.  At the very least, it's close."
&gt;Giannis is clearly better than Dwight ever was lol.  Dwight was 23 when he beat a 66 win Cavs team with LeBron James in the 2009 ECF
LeBron James for Sterling Brown
"I remember Zach Lowe saying something about his post scoring in an article or podcast; lemme see if I can find it *Edit: found it: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28516139/ten-nba-things-like-including-spurs-new-threat  4. Nikola Jokic is back -- with moonballs! Over October and early November, Jokic was averaging around eight post touches per 100 possessions, a sharp decline from last season, per Second Spectrum. Entire halves passed without Jokic demanding the ball on the block, where he presents a bulldozing mismatch for most normal-sized centers. Jokic also happens to be the best inside-out (and outside-in, and sideways, and backward) passing big in the league, and maybe the best ever. His passivity was a problem.  Not anymore. Jokic over the last month is averaging almost 18 post touches per 100 possessions, by far the most in the league. The Nuggets are mauling teams when he gets the ball down there: a hilarious 1.339 points per possession on any trip since Jan. 1 featuring a Jokic post touch, a mark that would rank third for the season among players who have recorded at least 100 post-ups, per Second Spectrum. (The top two? Nemanja Bjelica and -- gulp -- LeBron James.)  Granted, this is on any possession, so it includes possessions where he passes it. There might be another article or podcast"
I miss the LeBron James Jones decade
"&gt; Knicks Were ~~LeBron James' 1st Choice in 2010, Meeting Was~~ 'A Disaster'"
"James played a lot of his career with stretch fives on the court.  In LA he has Javale or Dwight on the floor most of the time.  Teams are able to better defend him at the rim when you have a big in the area to help.  When the big has to rotate farther or isn't there at all, you are more likely to have a foul at the rim.  He also has lost a decent amount of burst in traffic.  That means he isn't jumping as high or as aggressively when attacking with a defender or two near him.  That makes him a lot easier to defend.  One of your links points out how frequently he is being blocked.  I've watched every LeBron game this year.  He isn't getting officiated poorly at all."
"Top 5 in assists during the 2010’s  1. Russell Westbrook- 6,462  2. Chris Paul- 6,215  3. Rajon Rondo- 5,626  4. LeBron James- 5,503  5. John Wall- 5,282"
"Vague language is vague. What constitutes significant? 5%, 10%, 50%, Lebron James? Seriously might as well have said nothing."
"Whether it be “most” or “some”, it does not mean everyone. Some people actually follow the news and read up onto world news before LeBron James makes a comment about it. LeBron James is similar to most of the people, people who possess a double standard and remain hypocritical. If roles were reversed and someone in China claimed that a supporter of black lives matter was “uneducated”, there would be backlash. You don’t need to even follow it, but when you try to attack someone for standing up for it, you are wrong. The facts are the facts."
"I don’t need to assume. When someone like Daryl Morey comes out and openly supports Hong Kong only to then have LeBron James try to call Morey “uneducated” is ridiculous. You can believe in social justice and have a cause, that’s fine. However, when you start shooting down people who stand up for it, you become ignorant and look stupid."
Lebron. James.
"Copying the stuff below from another comment I made. It only addresses LeBron, since I've never looked into the entire Lakers FTA as a whole.  Definitely not this year. At one point, he was tied for his career-high in drives and had a career low FTA/game. He's still currently at a career low in FTA/game.  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/1/24/21080019/lebron-james-los-angeles-lakers-free-throws  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html  This year he's definitely not getting his fair share of calls. He's actually still at a career high in drives and a career low in FTA/game.  From the article (January 24)  &gt;LeBron’s career average coming into this season was 8.1 free-throw attempts per game. Last year he attempted 7.6. To go a bit deeper, his free-throw rate heading into this season was .413. Right now it’s lower than ever before at .274, and for the very first time it’s below his three-point rate."
LaMarcus Alridge.  I've gotten into the habit of calling LeBron James LBJ and then getting it mixed up with Lyndon B. Johnson
"Definitely not this year. At one point, he was tied for his career-high in drives and had a career low FTA/game.

"&gt;A decade later, the 2010 NBA free agent chase of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade &amp; Chris Bosh remains a compelling story  Agree to disagree."
"[He interviewed him after LeBron had knocked up his gf in 2004.](https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2010/11/24/a-tale-of-two-akron-guys-in-south-beach)  &gt;The two of them stood under some bleachers. LeBron clearly was uncomfortable. Let's not make this hard, Brian said. You're about to become a father. Tell me how you feel.  &gt;Excited, LeBron said, but also a little nervous.  &gt;Brian asked him what he was going to name his first son.  &gt;LeBron, LeBron said.  &gt;The story Brian wrote was about LeBron's excitement, and how he wanted to be a better dad than his own dad was for him.  &gt;After the birth of his son, ­LeBron returned to training camp, and all the other reporters asked him about it. They asked LeBron what he had named his son.  &gt;""Brian Windhorst James.""  &gt;The reporters laughed. The odd response, Brian thought, was LeBron's way of thanking him for how he handled the situation."

"All-Time:   Chris Paul, Steve Nash, LeBron James, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan"
"...? LeBron James is a do it all yourself player. That’s his game. He scores, he passes, he always has the ball in his hands. That’s what he ALWAYS does. You can’t say “of course he played better because he uses less energy” because we’ve seen Bron be the best player in the world while exerting the most energy lmao. It’s literally his game. And despite all of that, Durant had a 28.6 usage to LeBrons 30.6.   Let’s also not pretend he didn’t have Kyrie, who averaged more than Steph, and Love who averaged just as much as Klay.  I just don’t think people don’t realize how abnormal of a performance 2017 KD Finals was. Yes, the Warriors were better. But individually if you watch the series, that’s a level of play KD hasn’t reached even in a Warriors jersey prior.   Also, KD guarded Bron a lot of that series while Bron was guarding Iggy and Draymond. We love to rewrite what actually happened in these Finals to discredit KD and I get it, but let’s just try to appreciate this."
You know the fmvp is just decided by 11 random media members rights? Also most of those media members wanted to give it to lebron because he averaged 35 points per game(which i think it really should’ve just been given to lebron). Only reason they gave it to iguodala was because he was guarding James. Your argument is based off of biased speculation. And you acknowledge i was correct about the players cp3 played with being good. but then you say curry would do terrible with those teams. Idk I’d take James harden over klay Thompson’s any day of the week to be honest. Also curry has had plenty of playoff and finals moments. But yet I can’t think of any Chris Paul playoff moments except him choking to the rockets in 2015 and getting hurt in 2018 and choking again like I said in 2019. You also haven’t addressed how mvp is a team award. Especially since Chris hasn’t been good enough to actually win that award. Your arguments are weak man.
What???  Name a bigger name in sports right now than lebron james
Lebron James will finally reveal his name has been Lejon Brames this whole time
"Huh? LeBron James is clearly the type of player who would he MVP caliber and a champion in any era of basketball. He’s a transcendent talent.   It’s obvious that Wilt Chamberlain would not be putting up the numbers he did in any other era. When the only argument you can make for his greatest of all time candidacy relies on stats that he would not be able to rack up otherwise, the entire case falls apart."
It was so  disappointing and sad to see someone as influential as lebron fucking james say something like that. That man could single handily make Nike stop with the sweat shops
"Listen up very closely. I think that an important player (sometimes considered to be a GM) and the most important player currently playing would make the NBA cancellation occur, and that players’ name would be LeBron James!"
"Hakeem Olajuwon.   He completely changed the way the NBA thought of centers, and how teams defend against a big with that kind of skill set. Even his own teammates would watch him in awe, like his infamous performance against David Robinson in the ‘94 playoffs.   Tons of players look up to him for guidance on how to elevate their post game - Kobe Bryant, Amare Stoudemaire, Lebron James, Dwight Howard..that list goes to show what kind of legacy he left behind."

"The Nets trade is one of the great heists in recent memory, but I feel like you're overvaluing it if you're expecting the Celtics to get a LeBron level player from those picks. You could have the #1 pick every year for ten years and not get a player on that level - not every draft has one.  5 years ago the Celtics were a 40-42 team that owned 3 future lottery picks and a pick swap (#17 in 2014, #3 in 2016, #1 for #22 in 2017, and #8 in 2018).   Turning the two top five picks into Brown and Tatum is a pretty good haul - Tatum looks like the best player in his draft and they managed to pick up a decent prospect in Langford on top of that. Brown is probably the 4th or 5th best player in his class.   Turning the 2014 #17 and 2018 #8 into James Young and one year of Kyrie isn't great, but it's not terrible either, it's not like they would have done all that much better by keeping the pick (Sexton).   In hindsight, the thing that really hurt the Celtics was the Hayward injury rather than any trade or draft decisions. If they had Sabonis instead of Brown, Gary Harris instead of James Young, and SGA from the 2018 pick, they would still be in essentially the same position - a young team with a good shot at the Conference Finals but which probably won't go any further."

Chicago Bulls F/C, Tyson Chandler: ""We're witnessing greatness right now. We need to understand that. (asked: ""Is he the best of the best?"") Yeah, definitely.""  Mavs GM, Mark Cuban: ""It's amazing. Beyond amazing. He's on another level from any other player at this point. It's like he is toying with teams. If you push up on him, he just takes two steps back and shoots from further out. I hope the NBA adjusts its TV schedule so we all can see him play more.

That guy is incredible. That's why he's the best player in the league  Orlando Magic Assistant GM, Otis Smith: ""Whether you like him or dislike him, Kobe is a special player. He has the killer instinct in him that a lot of the talented players don't have. When he smells blood, he goes for the jugular. That's a (Michael) Jordan-like quality.""  Hornets Guard Kirk Snyder: ""I heard about it after I had finished hanging out with David West, and he called me and said that Kobe had scored 81. My first thought was is that I'm in the NBA with probably one of the best players ever to play in the NBA.""  Jerry West: ""I don't know if anyone could have stopped him last night. It's so senseless to me to say he shouldn't take over like that. You give the same amount of shots to everybody else and they're not making that many, I know it. Players are jealous of greatness. Kobe is a unique talent and a unique person. His belief that he can jump to the moon is never going to change. But I admire him, what he's been able to overcome. You would think he would be a fair-haired man of the NBA with what's he's already done. But he's taken a fairly good battering.  Ex-Bull and now-Analyst Steve Kerr: ""I'm always one to credit the guys who win. I don't know if I would have given Kobe the M.V.P. last week. But what he did in the game last night, he's so clearly the best player out there."""
"Jfc, that's my bad... thought they would've put like Lebron James Jr."
Phft Lebron James smells like poop.
"""In what ways were Lebron’s comments against the idea that one can speak out without governmental consequences?""   Well Lebron literally said: Yes, we do have freedom of speech,” James said. “But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others, when you only think about yourself.” He added: “So many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually.  He is talking about the ramifications the chinese goverment could have imposed on him and his money. You see how that runs counter to the idea that free spech is predicated on the ability to speak out with consequences from goverment?   And no he didn't say Morrey should be punished. Give him some credit, saying Morrey should be punished would be branding suicide. What he did do was question Morreys educational abiliy to speak out on the subject (because apparently you need to be especially educated to see that forcing your rule on millions of people who don't want it is wrong). If you read between the lines on such a blatant comment, i can't help you."

LeBron James has left the chat*
"You came out of nowhere saying that i said china was going to murder lebron james.  You did not ""see a whole"".  You created one.  The definition of strawmanning."
"Players play sick now, well before rona, and nobody talks about it. Unless it’s Lebron James, it’s not gonna be a big deal and he’d have to have the same symptoms because they’re the ones that make it hard to play (fever, fatigue and vomiting)"
"If LeBron James truly wants to catch up with Michael JEFFREY Jordan, he should infect himself with the coronavirus and play.   Otherwise he’s going to spend the rest of his career chasing the Ghost in Chicago, the real Number 23"
Don't all of us already assume that though? Like Lebron James should not be staying in the same room as Chris Chiozza
"There is literally nothing LeBron James could say that would change how China deals with HK. Recognizing that fact doesn’t make him a fraud, and his desire to focus on issues he cares more about isn’t hypocrisy."
"The rings argument is somewhat wacky in the first place... I mean yeah he's lost a lot of finals... but that means he's *been* to a lot of finals. 9 of them to be precise, that's 3 more than Jordan, same as Magic. Magic went 5-4. Jerry West, the freakin' logo, went 9 times and only won once. Lebron still has a chance to catch Russell in finals appearances, which is completely insane.   Here's a fun stat: Lebron James has never lost a series in the first round of the playoffs. Michael Jordan has lost three. Lebron has also only lost three times in the Semis. Michael Jordan has also lost three series in the semis. Jordan made the playoffs 13 times and exited 6 of them before the conference finals. Lebron has already made the playoffs 13 times to date and has lost only 3 times before the conference finals. Jordan had Pippen on all three teams that lost in the semis. Lebron had Zydrunas Ilgauskas twice and Mo Williams once for #2 guys in those semis series."
"Don’t just look at his FG%. Look at this TS%. Plus you got to remember that this over the course of 6 years  Trae Young[2018-20]: 23.6 PPG on 56.7 TS%  Bradley Beal[2018-20]: 27.6 PPG on 58.0 TS%  Stephen Curry[2014-20]: 26.5 PPG on 64.7 TS%  Dame Lillard[2014-20]: 25.6 PPG on 58.4 TS%  Kevin Durant[2014-20]: 26.3 PPG on 63.8 TS%  LeBron James[2014-20]: 26.2 PPG on 59.7 TS%   Before Westbrook, who was going to help carry the scoring load? He’s the first player to average more than 20 points next to Harden on the Rockets.   Last year, his best scorers were Capela(16.6) and Gordon(16.2). He was averaging 36.1 PPG.   In 2017-18, he averaged 30.4 PPG. His next best scorers were Cp3(18.6)and Gordon(18)  In 2016-17, he averaged 29.1 PPG. His next best scorers were Gordon(16.2) and Lou Will(14.9)"
"3...2...1...Kareem about to be blackballed out of league history because he's spoken out of line.   Just like the Hong Kong protests, and native americans and Jews. The reality is there are tons of groups who are being actively repressed and disparaged in 2020.  Yet the league makes it's activism decisions on money and what's best for them and openly mocks and shuns anyone who steps out of line, a line set by one of the smallest brains and biggest mouths in the league, Lebron James.   That in and of itself is tyranny."
"He didn’t have a great team for majority of his prime, it was only in the second half he had great team-mates, and if you agree with people that Kobe played with great players, then he also couldn’t be top 3. Every top 5 player has played with another legend, it’s just how the game works. Examples  Shaq- Kobe, Penny Hardaway &amp; Dwayne Wade  Wilt Chamberlain- Jerry West &amp; Elgin Baylor  Bill Russel-11 hall of famers.  Lebron James- Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosch &amp; Kyrie  Jordan- Scottie Pippen &amp; Dennis Rodman  Kareem- Oscar Robertson, Majic Johnson, James Worthy  Majic- Kareem Abdul Jabbar, James Worthy  Larry Bird- Kevin McHale, Robert Parish  Kobe- Shaq, Pau Gasol &amp; Lamar Odom  This is proof that every legend has great players with them, it’s almost inevitable that a legend will want to team up with them."

"I can. Any discussion of Hong Kong at all, even if the person only brings the subject up to allude to LeBron’s flimsy persona, is infinitely more than what LeBron James decided to do when given an opportunity to speak up for those people suffering."
"Thanks everyone for your advice, help, and support. I’m overwhelmed by how much you guys are rooting for this to happen. So update I’ve DM’d people on Instagram (still need to create a Twitter) I don’t know much about basketball but the youths idol is Lebron James (he has an old CAVS jersey hanging up in his room) so I DM’d Rich Paul who I believe is his manager after looking some stuff up. I know Lebron James is probably the toughest guy to get to but I hope it’s not impossible. It would be amazing if there were some Basketball players that maybe have experience loss and trauma or even been part of the foster care system that could share with the youth as well."
Yes because the path to defeating China is through Lebron James.  Listen to yourself
"He doesn't hate Chinese people, I don't think anyone thinks that. But the facts are these: China is obliterating the rights and freedoms of people in Hong Kong, ""disappearing"" dissidents and locking up opposition politicians, the usual tyrannical superpower domination shit.  Daryl Morey tweeted ""Stand With Hong Kong""  LeBron James took a beat, considered his reaction, and then effectively told Daryl to shut the fuck up in case he loses 10 million of his 500 million dollars."

"And where is the support for the Hispanics at the border? Why are they the Holocaust survivors and their progeny not supporting the people in cages at the border?  And the Hong Kong citizens? Where is the outrage over Lebron literally telling people to educate themselves over how to approach China’s systemic oppression? A literal high school grad gifted athleticism telling us to educate ourselves. Where the fuck are we?  Where is the outrage? Multiple people are the problem here. It starts at the top with Lebron and his disgraceful approach to human rights. And it should be known that Nike, Disney, the NBA, etc. have enabled this kid from the world go.  And yes, Lebron James is still a kid. He hasn’t had to change a thing since high school. Not a realistic life and shouldn’t be looked upon as though he were a role model.  There shouldn’t be sides to human rights abuses. We should be together.   It’s all reprehensible.   Using your race to support oppression is some sectors as opposed to others is a humiliating, and in of itself, an oppressive, trait."
"J  Magic Johnson,Micheal Jordan,Lebron James,Nikola Jokic,Kareem-abdul Jabbar"
Thats why lebron james is always a poser for social justice. He only does that benefit him the most as a brand. I appreciate all the good he as done but he is always a walking hypocrite that see himself first and foremost (nothing wrong with that).
"This is the hypocrisy I’ve always tried to point out to my black friends.   When they experience racism as black men, they want everyone else to care. But as soon as the topic comes to racism or discrimination against other people like Hispanics or Asians or women or gay people, they join in on the oppression by making fun of them and repeating the racism they say they’re so against.   That’s why all this woke shit is bull shit - anyone who’s “woke” is just late to the party of political activism and needs Lebron James to tell them how to feel and think. He’s done some pretty shady/morally questionable stuff himself and pretends to be a virtuous role model."
"Starting lineup of:  Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, LeBron James, Jaren Jackson, Nikola Jokic"
Considering J has:  * Magic Johnson * Michael Jordan * Bobby Jones * LeBron James * Nikola Jokic  I think it's them
Magic Johnson   Michael jordon  Lebron James   Kareem Abdul jabbar   Joe Johnson?
"Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, doesn’t matter, your mom"
"&gt;and has a solid argument for GOAT.  Outside longevity stats, what exactly would make LeBron the GOAT?  &gt;I'm not a Bron stan but I think that people should look past rings and realize that his recent postseasons, even past his prime, versus the KD Warriors rival Dirk's 2011 or Duncan's 2003  Eh, not really. The likes of Dirk &amp; Duncan went though significantly much harder path to reach NBA Finals and eliminated teams who were genuine title contenders.  &gt;he just went up against the most stacked team of all time.  The ""most stacked team of all time"" got taken to 7 games by James Harden (a player who is carrying a reputation for underachieving in the playoffs)? Or how someone like Dirk actually beat Miami Heat's big 3 with Jason Terry as 2nd option lol."
LeBron James is a hypocritical coward. I'm so disappointed in him.
That player: lebron James
"He was afforded more opportunity the last 3 games when the spurs realized he’d arrived as a star. Took 5 shots game 1 in around 20 minutes and took 9 shots in 30 min game 2.   But games 3-5 where the spurs ran away with the series, he averaged 24/9/2 with 2 steals and 2 blocks on incredible efficiency while guarding LeBron James. I’d definitely say that is at the least star level."
He should do what Lebron did and have James on his jersey
"I just wish like Paul George or somebody would put ""LeBron"" on the back of their jersey. Not even ""James"", but his first name. It would fuck so many casual fans and nervous staff members up."
Apparently there was a DJ set at the Coronado Springs pool and Dwight Howard was the only one who showed up.  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/7/12/21322067/lakers-news-nba-bubble-blogs-lebron-james-adrian-wojnarowski-dwight-howard-dj-set-danny-green-update

"When your world revolves around LeBron James, yes"
LeBron James used to hero ball like hell in his early seasons. It's fascinating how much the guy has expanded his range as a player.
"I just don't get where people are getting the Rockets hype from.  I can buy them being the 3rd best team in the west, no one but the top two are that great. But people really think you can beat Lebron+AD or Giannis with the biggest guy on the floor being PJ Tucker?  And they believe this because they have top tier playoff performers James Harden and Russell Westbrook?  This team is just flat worse than the past Rockets."
"FTs are largely mental. The proof is Lebron James. The guy devotes so much of himself to perfecting and improving every facet of his game, from his passing, to his health, to his shooting(!). It used to be the right call to leave Lebron open from midrange. Now, he's known for hitting 'fuck-you' deep threes, and is hitting 35% of his 3s at a career-high volume of 6 attempts per game. But he's still below average at FTs."
"PG: John Wall - As a true point guard, the dude is amazing and lifts up the entire team. He is a pass first and isn’t a score first PG which will help bring up the team especially since it will be stacked with great players.  SG: Klay Thompson - I know most people have Michael Jordan here but with this team, I want a great role player that does extremely well off ball and can drain 3s. There might be a better option here, but I have to give it to Klay.  SF: Lebron James - With this back court, I want a really dominant front court so who better than Lebron. The dude is amazing at offense and defense as well as is a great play maker, he should work well with this team.  PF: Tim Duncan - In my eyes he is one of the best PFs of all time so why not? He will be dominant on any team you put him on.  C: Shaq - One of the best Centers and imagine Wall feeding him in the paint. Would be such a nasty combo."
"The point is that he's hardly pulling lol.

Yea but the fact that the person who seems to get the most crap for american capitalism is Lebron James is patently fucking ridiculous

Lebron had a drop in efficiency in finals too (not as bad as bosh but still significant) and Lebron’s scoring dropped off a ton too."
"It's fucking bizarre how many times people will shoehorn in this comment about LeBron. I wonder how many of them marched at BLM rallies in their own communities?  No way of knowing for sure but it is probably very few, I'd have to guess. It is much easier to rip LeBron James about a foreign country than it is to tackle inequality in your own country."
"To get cynical LeBron only takes on issues and charity that fits into the neat nexus of helping his image while not hurting his long term bottom line. That makes him no different than just about every corporation. Doesn’t mean he isn’t doing good. Hell, capitalism at its finest. Lebron James is a brand. He wants to sell that brand in China. Building schools in his home town is a great cause, but it certainly doesn’t hurt his brand. His social justice message doesn’t hurt his brand.   But if he said Morey was right, it would hurt his brand. If he said nothing, and China pulled the nba from broadcasting, or screwed around with the production at the factories where people work for pennies (if they are lucky) make his shoes, that hurts his brand.   He has made it known he wants to be a billionaire. Can’t do that if you can’t make your main product or sell it."
OG was an amazing defender as a rookie. In his first playoffs he was the primary defender of John Wall and of Lebron James in the same playoffs. Him having a down 2nd year followed by an emergency surgery right before the playoffs made him kindof forgotten by most people that don’t follow the Raptors.
He played against LeBron James and Curry
LeBron James
“Lebron James will not play in game 5 against the Oklahoma City Thunder after a man named Jim Paul reported that the king had visited a frozen yogurt shop outside of Disney World.”
"As above, he has gone above and beyond his duties. MJ and Kobe didn't go this far out and they didn't have to, everyone is entitled to enjoy the fruits of their labor how they want.      James not only created a school, he did it right with quality and the village and did it in a very needing place in Akron even if he never lives there again.     I remember the hate he got when he hired his friends, but he just shows signs of a true leader bringing out their potential and now they are a very respected and legitimate force in entertainment and they all wouldn't have gotten the shop to grow into it if it wasn't for his vision.    As per hong kong, be it him or steve Kerr...Whats unfortunate is that china won't just boycot lebron james shoes or steve kerr...interviews?... they wil hurt their teammates, every single player who is barely making it and people who don't have the same luxuries or don't agree with James and it is a diferent force if they are taking money out of other peoples hands without them agreeing to it and thats how China has strangled their speech..its a tough position and doesn't take away from other great things hes done. No one is required to save us all, he could hide out his wealth and tune it all out, he chooses to help where he believes.     The issue and story here is the Government of Chinese's abuse not just in Hong Kong but with the Chinese muslims and their tactics that are abusive..it is not animplication of their populace any more then trump/obama disenfranchising half of america in their own terms.."
"&gt;Has anyone seen LeBron and the snake from the Garden of Eden in the same place at the same time?  [Here you go.](https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/01/011917-kevin-durant-lebron-james-pi.jpg)  Come on, someone had to do it."
"If the average redditor doesn't care and LeBron James doesn't care, that means nobody cares. Didn't you hear?"
Next day report: Turns out these two players were LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo.
"I'm in an NBA message board why would I talk about Yeman when it has nothing to do with the NBA or what happened with China.  If you would like to discuss geo politics I'm more than willing. There are atrocities happening all over the world. Unfortunately I am just 1 person and can only focus on so many things at one time but my stance has always been the same and that's justice for everyone.  Im also critical of LeBron because he had an opportunity to say something about China and its human rights abuses and decided not to. He was critical of Morey and chose money and his brand over what was right. He's also an employee of Nike and as a result directly benefiting from their human rights atrocities and yet says nothing but is put on this pedestal as some great human rights advocate. I'm not either but neither is lebron. As far as I can tell he only takes up causes that's are beneficial to him. If he gave a fuck about what Nike was doing he'd say something, or use his influence to change things. Soon to be Billionaire 1 day lebron james is no different than any other billionaire out there."
Imagine how good we would think Michael Jordan is if the media supported him like they support Lebron lol.  The media has you young kids simpin for James’ Juice.    They literally have an “excuse” for every single action he has lol.
"I think, ""LeBron James can do what he wants with his jersey name because he walks the walk"" is a consistent take"
"Well, the thing is, LeBron is a REALLY big deal. It's kind of like how Mahomes being in that video the NFL put out is almost certainly a major reason that Goodell did exactly what they asked him to.   The league can pick a fight with Daryl Morey, he's essentially a nonentity. The league will have a VERY hard time picking a fight with LeBron James.  So as far as side switching goes, no. But in terms of cause and effect, it does matter."
&gt;Shock Wes’ music career depends on it   You've never searched Lebron James on sound cloud before have you?
"If ""silence = being complicit"" wasn't been such a prominent message in the Black Lives Matter movement it would be a lot easier to forgive the people who are proponents of the movement for completely ignore bad things that happen to other people of another race.   And yeah I'm not undermining the BLM movement because it stands for great things and important things that need to be changed. I wouldn't hold it against a charity for taking his money and doing good things with it. But fuck Lebron James, he's more concerned with making his 200 millionth dollar than a few million people getting their rights eroded year by year. He should not be the figurehead or (seen as) a leader in any movement that purports to be about elevating humanism.   I saw people in Hong Kong holding ""Black Lives Matter"" signs while they're out protesting even though it's not an issue that's specific to Hong Kong. There were black people in the US that supported Free Hong Kong. It's not movement vs movement. It's about the individual Lebron James."
Okay? And he was still wrong in saying that. I have a hard time believing the guy with the degree from Northwestern and MBA from MIT would somehow be less educated on this subject than high school graduate Lebron James.  And there was literally no way to take his response besides a concern for his wallet. Some bullshit appeal to spirituality.
Does this mean LeBron James doesn't support equality??? He only supports James???
"Kyrie Irving's career outside LeBron James is not great. If his comparison is center Kyrie, I think that's great lol."
Reminds me of that tweet that Bronny wore a different number so people wouldn’t recognize him and someone responded bro who’s that kid LeBron James Jr never heard of him
Toronto Raptors and LeBron James.
"Lebron ""cant back down jj barrea"" James"
"Here is Lebron's reason for naming Bronny after him  “When I was younger, obviously, I didn’t have a dad. My whole thing was, whenever I have a kid, not only is he gonna be a junior, but I’m gonna do everything this man didn’t do. … Only thing I can do is give them the blueprint and [they can] take their own course with it.”  He has regrets now cause of the weight of his name on his child plus it can ignore/downplay the merits Bronny achieves now  This was an interesting read: https://theundefeated.com/features/lebron-james-regret-about-his-sons-name-is-more-than-a-sound-bite/"
Revenge? But I like Lebron..   I am just pointing out why people are annoyed with Lebron James and everyone who called out Drew Brees but kept quiet when Desean and Stephen Jackson spouted worse nonsense.  &gt; that's just a polite way of lumping all black people together.  B... but how? When everyone is saying the exact same thing about racism in the white community and no one accuses those people of lumping the whole white community together..  Whatever. So much for silence is violence...

Lebron James was on 2K with Quinn Cook and AD the other night. All they’re doing is video games if they got lebron on
Or Lebron James.
Think about this for a minute.. we've never actually seen LeBron James &amp; Sylvanas Windrunner in the same room have we?  Coincidence? You decide
"Duh, his full name is LeBron I Promise James."
It’s still fuck Hong Kong for life   — Probably Lebron James
"https://www.colorlines.com/articles/trayvon-martins-dad-thanks-lebron-james-and-miami-heat-support  Wow, seems like you’re talking out your ass again..."
"Let's call it what it is....if LeBron can't market it himself, he won't do it. He wasn't consulted, he didn't get to get his *preferred* message so he's going to skip the entire thing altogether in the name of all things that he has cultivated under the LeBron James Brand. Brand/Image &gt; social movements  This is Barbershop and Taco Tuesday all over again."
I’d much rather Waiters or Caruso be on the floor as a secondary ball handler. Rondo has the worst on/off on the team individually and in two man combinations with both LeBron James and Anthony Davis. It’s truly remarkable how bad he is on both ends of the floor.
LOL yo fuck lebron james. Nothing more than an athlete who selectively chooses which human rights he cares about. Fuck china and fuck any shill trying to defend the NBAs course of action
"On saturday night, the league brought three CCP officials to spin propaganda at poolside parties at each of the three Disney hotels housing players. Only Lebron James showed up."
"LeBron James received death threats, has had racial epithets drawn on his home, and face tons of pushback from everyone for every word he has said. It's amazing how much grace white athletes get for their lack of political activity while LeBron and other Black athletes get blasted for not speaking on every social justice or human rights issue under the sun."
Lebron James at it again.
"&gt;He's more like Trump or Tucker Carlson. There's a lot of other stuff besides the bigotry.  Neither Trump nor Tucker Carlson have said anything even close to the vile stuff that comes out of Farrakhans mouth every time he speaks  I don't think LeBron James is a follower. But yes, it is something close to half. And also nearly every famous rapper"
"&gt;based on the support that is given to the dishonorable Louis Farrakhan  Louis Farrakhan is actually known for things outside his bigotry unlike David Duke.  There are a fair amount of people who have probably never even heard his anti-semitism.  He's more like Trump or Tucker Carlson.  There's a lot of other stuff besides the bigotry. Contemptible nonetheless, but not to the point where you can paint everyone who followed some of the things he said as bigots.   Even then, just because you've heard a couple athletes say something about Farrakhan doesn't mean that all of a sudden half of them follow him, let alone LeBron James."
Friendly reminder that LeBron James is a sellout who only gives a shit if it affects him in any way shape or form. He doesn't care about human rights. He cares about Chinese money and is willing to defend the CCP's oppression of Hong Kong.
LeBron James cares about people being allowed to say fuck on company emails and defending the CCP he doesn't have time to worry about the rise of anti semitism amongst his peers. Especially when those peers might buy his shoes.
"&gt;	“Yes, we do have freedom of speech,” James said. “But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others, when you only think about yourself. I don’t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke. So many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, it can be a lot of negative that comes with it.”  Fuck Lebron James he only cares about issues that effect him."
&gt;The problem with white people is that they assume all minorities and disenfranchised groups hold each other's hands and sing Kumbaya which is completely false.  No one is saying that either.    At hand though is the issue that people are calling for LeBron James to comment on an issue he has nothing to do with. That's stupid.
Yeah but the main point is you can’t shit on a random redditor for doing nothing because he doesn’t have as much influence as LeBron James.
"It's about time to give the balded Mamba a real shot here. He's a great fit alongside LeBron James and probably the best allround defender in the remaining backcourt apart from Green, I'd say.  Sure, it would hurt their playmaking from the bench, but I don't trust JR (anymore) and Cook (yet) to start and not to be exploited by any good PG.   Option 2.   Curushow leads their 2nd unit and they play two wGuards with Green and KCP. Bradley was more an undersized 2 than a real PG anyway, so this would probably be the lineup that needs the least amount of adaption.   OPTION 3.  GO BIG and play Kuz on the 2 spot."
"Lebron ""Mr. China"" James.  What a sell-out Communist shill."

LeBron James: Selective Justice Warrior
The problem is that a team with 18 wins gets to pick Lebron James and a team with 19 wins gets to pick darko milicic. Its a minuscule difference in terms of wins but a massive difference in terms of player talent. You shouldn’t be guaranteed a generational player just because you tanked the hardest.
"You do realize that's for all shots he takes from that range? Not post-ups? Terrible use of statistics.   &gt;Only eight players, per Synergy, had more than 300 post-ups, and James generated 1.102 points per possession on his, a higher mark than everyone except Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic.  [article](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/thats-pretty-interesting-in-the-post-lakers-lebron-james-can-eat-the-blazers-alive/#:~:text=Only%20eight%20players%2C%20per%20Synergy,Joel%20Embiid%20and%20Nikola%20Jokic.)"
"Just gotta say - the circlejerk around Anthony Davis recently by this sub has been honestly insane. Things I’ve read recently from various people: AD has never won anything important, isn’t a top 5 player this season, has never been top 5 at any point in his career, is not a superstar, and that he’s lesser than Jayson Tatum. I know circlejerking around players being shit after one bad game happens *a lot*, but my god, reading about how the guy with the 3rd best career PER in NBA history, only behind Michael Jordan and LeBron James, is actually a bum kinda makes my eyes bleed."
LeBron James
Lebron James 8-20 12 assists Rest of team 17-42
"1. Cheick Diallo  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. James Harden  4. Kevin Durant (this one is, admittedly, debatable due to injury)  5. Lebron James  6. Kawhi Leonard  7. Steph Curry  8. Luka Doncic  9. Nikola Jokic  10. Damian Lillard"
But why would you have Hill Iso and LeBron offball when you could have LeBron James make the plays and set up Hill for open shots
LeBron Raymone James
PG - LeBron James  SG - Michael Jordan  SF - Kobe Bryant  PF - Karl Malone  C - Wilt Chamberlain  6th - Kevin Durant (Backup forward)  7th - Allen Iverson (backup Guard)  8th - Bob McAdoo (Backup Center)
"Out of all these guys, only seven of them had 50+ in a Conference Finals or Finals. They are...  - Elgin Baylor - 61 (Finals) - Rick Barry - 55 (Finals) - Michael Jordan - 55 (Finals) - Jerry West - 53 (Finals) - LeBron James - 51 (Finals) - Bob Pettit - 50 (Finals) - Dirk Nowitzki - 50 (WCF) - Jordan is the only other guy to have 50+ in the Conference Finals (54)"
"Lol you are reaching on some of your points   I don’t care if AD’s cast was weak. Pelicans supporting cast been weak for years after 2015. Golden State was the 1st seed, they were the eighth.  I don’t care if James Harden wasn’t the facilitator he is today. Steph and Harden were both part of the 2009 draft. Harden was also a higher pick. Steph just developed better by the time 2015 went around  I don’t care if Kyrie was unfortunately hurt. He missed one postseason in Boston and another one in Brooklyn. At a certain point, people just have to understand he is injury prone af  Also I don’t care Lebron had to play with JR Smith or Tristan Thompson. Didn’t the Cleveland Cavaliers give them bags after the 2016 chip? Hell Lebron asked Jr to join the Lakes a few months ago. During the 2017 finals, Tristan was making more money than Steph   Anyway this was the Warriors first chip since 1975, of course we are going to celebrate it"
"With context added, I'm not really sure if GSW's 2015 Championship is all that special lol...  ----  GSW's 2015 Championship is nowhere near impressive compared to 2017.    **1st round (4-0 vs NOP):** Jrue Holiday only played 55 minutes as he struggled with injuries. Anthony Davis’ supporting cast was just weak af.  **2nd round (4-2 vs MEM):** Mike Conley missed a game and struggled with hazy vision throughout the series as a result of a facial injury he sustained at the end of the previous series against Portland.  **WCF (4-1 vs HOU):** The Rockets missed their starting PG (sensing a trend?) Patrick Beverly for the entire series. James Harden wasn’t nearly the facilitator he is today. They had geriatric Jason Terry at PG, who just got predictably obliterated.  **NBA Finals 2015 (4-2 vs CLE):** The Cavs had already lost Kevin Love in the ECF, then lost Kyrie in Game 1 in the midst of nearly stealing the game. LeBron was left with Knicks rejects JR and Shumpert, Matthew Dellavedova, Timofey Mozgov, and Tristan Thompson. And yet, Warriors got pushed to Game 6."
"And PG is not even close to LeBron.  Besides I'm talking about which duo is better, and James &gt; Leonard and Wade &gt; PG."

"No. There are many, many, many people who do not even know who Kevin Durant is in 2020. The average citizen.  Every single person knew who LeBron James was in 2010 and the majority had jokes or insults about his decision.  KD could never be as hated simply because he just isn’t as known across the country/world.  It’s MJ, LeBron, Kobe, and everyone else."
Declining isn't the issue. Its adapting to the skill set available. Plus im almost 100% sure a 32 year old klay Thompson will still be hot. Todays ballers arent like 2000s when it comes to health and things like that. That same logic applied to lebron james doesnt make much sense right? Cause lebron invested in his body. Whos to say klay and steph arent as invested in their bodies? Draymond can be the only real understandable player to your logic. His play style is wear and tear on the body.
"&gt; Lol that's absolutely shutting it down when it comes to harden. Especially since that average is being carried by one game.  his numbers aren't even right for harden vs. us lol it's **22.5**/6.3/6.3 on 39.4/34.4/87.1  &gt; You guys also weren't as open as you're saying.  because they don't want to acknowledge it's just portland's strategy for this series lol instead this subreddit is just giving the lakers' the benefit of the doubt because they're the number 1 seed and have lebron then using the ""portland has the 2nd worst perimeter defense"" as confirmation bias to all these missed shots being good open looks generated by the offense and not a defensive gamble by portland's coaching staff.  cause clearly terry stotts and company don't have access to statistics that show how poorly the lakers' role players (green, kuzma, morris, kcp, caruso, waiters, jr) have shot from 3 in the bubble (29% btw with kuz's 44% and morris' 38% lifting it lol) and clearly the team also doesn't have access the stats that show kuz, morris, waiters, kcp are all below average 3point shooters from 3 for their careers in general lol   portland clearly has a strategy that is daring the other players not named james or davis to make their shots through one game it has worked, we'll see if it continues to work though it could bite them in their ass."
"Oh?  ""joined LeBron James and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players to lead their teams in total points, rebounds, and assists for three straight seasons."""
"Neither did the Heat post Lebron.   We drafted well enough with Winslow / Richardson to stay afloat and found a good enough player (at the time) in Whiteside, even though we lost Wade and Bosh.   Adding Dragic a while back and Butler this year has been great, and developing good young players like Robinson has really done wonders for us without having to throw in the towel on any one season.   And that’s with the Heat making mistakes on James Johnson, Dion, and Tyler Johnson.  If you draft smart and develop players, you can avoid tanking without being a perennial 8th seed."
"""But you hate to continue to put yourself in these positions, but at the end of the day it's still just basketball, man, and that's what gives me comfortable and I'm more comfortable about it because it's just a game.""  - Lebron James down 2-0 during the 2017 Finals."
"In luka’s second season, he led the best offense in the nba.   In AD’s 9th season, he joined lebron James after failing to make the playoffs 6/8 of his first seasons, and preceded to be a net negative when he was on the floor without lebron"
"Yeah he wasn't ripping up the Clippers or Lakers during the regular season.  Nevermind the fucking BULLLLSHITTTT that comes with having Kyrie Irving on your team. If anyone would know its Celtics fans. And JT is doing it as a first option, Kyrie did it against GSW with LeBron fucking James on his team."
Getting by Melo or Trent a few times isn’t proof “lebron James is getting to the basket how he always has”.  Lebron didn’t get to the basket nearly enough *considering* it was Melo and Trent guarding him
"Looking back to that same 2018 season, the first Tuesday night games were Boston/Mil game 2 and Por/no game 2. They totaled 2.88mil and 2.9mil respectively. Now, I would expect those to be lower than last nights lakers game for a few reasons: Lebron James, The Lakers, series openers, maybe the bubble has an effect too, but today’s numbers at the end of the day, are up from similar games 2 years ago"

Ahhh the old Lebron James move.

Lebron James: ""One of my biggest regrets in this game is not signing with the Warriors in 2014 and taking all the credit for the championships to come.

"They don't really, but think of it this way. ""Biden campaigns in Akron, Ohio"" or ""Biden campaigns in Akron, Ohio with Lebron James"".  The former is barely even headline-worthy, the latter will warrant not only a headline but a whole story/video.  It's an easy way to generate attention, which presidential campaigns are always desperate to do."
What do you mean lol are James Harden and LeBron not getting recognition they deserve? Because they 100% are
"Man this Luka circlejerk.   If his name was Lebron or James Harden then we don’t have this. But a white european, oh shit he’s the best.  Except he’s not. Not even close to the best in this league."
KEMBA WALKER HAS TWO PLAYOFF WINS IN 2020 BEFORE LEBRON JAMES EVEN HAS ONE!
"Its an odd reaction because r/nba spent most of the time shitting on Horford for not being ""a star"" even as far back as his Atlanta days.  As soon as he leaves Celtics, he is a prime 26 year old LeBron James, before that he was a bum. Almost as if most posters were trying to wish misery on the Celtics, moreso than a realistic take on the signing."
I’ve legitimately never seen this in all my years of playing and watching basketball. It’s staggering to consider that high school basketball teams have more mental fortitude than the Lebron James lead Lakers. It doesn’t even look like they want to win lol
"&gt; the least successful star out of that draft class.  Well when you're comparing him to guys like LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, it ain't really that damning."
"The only two players in NBA history that have a higher career PER than Anthony Davis are Michael Jeffrey Jordan and LeBron Raymone James. I think Tatum is a more confident alpha-dog leader than AD, but AD's talent is off the charts."
Also 0 things over LeBron James
"Yeah man I respect that  And I promise I’m not trying to ignite the argument, but I would like to challenge a few things you said.  The heat were older than you think they were. Towards the end of their run (especially the beatdown the spurs gave them in 2014) they looked very old and tired. Lebron balled out in those finals but everyone outside of Ray Allen looked spent. (And Ray was no spring chicken - he just kept himself in remarkable shape). The spurs ran them off the court.  Wade’s knee had finally removed him from allstar caliber player - he missed like 50 games that season. Mike Miller was done. Shane Battier was done. Haslem was done. Birdman and James Jones- both also done. Rashard Lewis done. Bosh’s career ended the next season - though not bc of age but he was still like 32/33. The only main contributor in their 20s for Miami at the end was Mario Chalmers.   We can agree to disagree about KD losing to the warriors right before joining. I’m sure you’re not the only one who doesn’t factor in that detail. I’m just a little more old school about it. Different strokes for different folks. No harm no foul. Though I could never imagine MJ joining the pistons in ‘90 or Curry joining the Cavs after 2016 finals (just a few examples).  The NBA still had league-wide parity during the Miami days - but you’re right about the east’s parity being totally fucked during that time. Dallas beat them in 2011. Boston took them to the brink in 2012. Spurs took them to the brink in 2013 and blew them out in 2014. The title wasn’t a forgone conclusion to the extent of the KD warriors - in fact Miami was only the Vegas favorite 2 out of the 4 times in the finals.  I just really wanted the true rubber match between Cavs and warriors in 2017. Both teams felt they were cheated out of titles (Cavs injuries in 2015 and draymond in 2016) and KD just kinda slithered in there and ruined it lol"
So you wanna compare harden from age 23-30 to LeBron from 21-35. Yeah if you compare Hardens only prime years to LeBron's years including ore and post prime they are neck and neck.  Look I get it. To compare a offensive only guy like Harden to a all around guy like James you need to give every single advantage to Harden to even make him compare. But if you gave LeBron all the advantages and harden none it's no contest.  Point is Harden shrinks in the playoffs and is a chucker and will never win a title as the #1 option. And he is a shit #2 option because he is a chucker who sucks on defense so he wouldn't win a title as a #2 option either. And we already seen him choke himself out in the finals as a #3 option. So maybe if he plays 19 more years and signs on a championship team as the 7th option or something his fat ass might be able to be carried to a title but I wouldn't count on it. Dudes a straight up loser as we will see again when he has another recent MVP winner on his team and still can't even make the finals with no warriors. Lmfao
[Lillard had some old ones too](https://www.viralhoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Damian-Lillard-LeBron-James-Pussy.png)
If Lebron James &amp; Anthony Davis get bounced in round one of the NBA playoffs by the 8th seed Blazers most of the hysteria that would surely ensue would most likely be warranted.
*LeBron James likes this*
"to be fair... that'll be a neat story to tell your children. ""My first playoff game I was locking lebron james up so bad he tried to break my nose"""
"“If you don’t like LeBron James, you’re not a basketball fan.”"
"Thats your own bias, then. Statistically, LeBron and Jordan are TOGETHER in a tier of their own:  (Copied from a post I saved on here from a while ago)  Michael Jordan and LeBron James' absolute domination of all-time advanced playoff stats is astounding...  I honestly don't get how you can't have these two as your top 2 players of all time.  I picked some arbitrary ""elite"" qualifiers for some popular impact stats, and looked for the total seasons a player has hit that qualifier for a playoff run in their career, with a minimum of 2 games started.  **The qualifiers:**  PER: 30.0  WS/48: 0.270  BPM: 10.0  VORP: 2.5  So I checked how many times a player hit any of those qualifiers for a whole playoff run:  **30.0 PER or higher:**  LeBron James: 5 times  Michael Jordan: 4 times  Shaq: 3 times  No one else has done it more than twice  **0.270 WS/48 or higher:**  LeBron James: 5 times  Michael Jordan: 4 times  KAJ: 4 times  Dolph Shayes: 3 times  No one else has done it more than twice  **10.0 BPM or higher:**  LeBron James: 8 times  Michael Jordan: 8 times  Chris Paul: 4 times  Kawhi Leonard: 3 times  Tim Duncan: 2 times  No one else has done it more than once  **2.5 VORP or higher:**  LeBron James: 5 times  Michael Jordan: 5 times  No one else has done it more than once  Edit: I did a quick look at regular season impact stats, and Bron and MJ are alone at the top 2 in number of seasons with 30.0 PER, and seasons with 10.0 BPM, but for 0.270 WS/48, MJ is number 1 with Bron tied at third. However, if you bump the qualifier for WS/48 to 0.290, MJ and Bron end back up being tied for 1st again.

"At a certain point, accolades just become a product of who else you're sharing the league with. Yes, MJ and Kareem have more accolades than LeBron, but when we're talking the difference between 4 MVPs or 6 rings to 3, it just comes down to who they were sharing the league with. LeBron doesn't hit the brick wall that was the KD Warriors maybe he has 5 rings. MJ doesn't hit the brick wall that was the Pistons, maybe he has 7 or 8. LeBron, Kareem, and MJ all played at an MVP level in the regular season for over a decade. Accolades don't necessarily mean one player is better than the other when all 3 players have as full of trophy cabinets as they do.   When it comes to actual play, if we look at the stats, MJ and LeBron are easily in a tier of their own.    Copied and pasted from a post i saved on here from a while ago:  Michael Jordan and LeBron James' absolute domination of all-time advanced playoff stats is astounding...  I honestly don't get how you can't have these two as your top 2 players of all time.  I picked some arbitrary ""elite"" qualifiers for some popular impact stats, and looked for the total seasons a player has hit that qualifier for a playoff run in their career, with a minimum of 2 games started.  **The qualifiers:**  PER: 30.0  WS/48: 0.270  BPM: 10.0  VORP: 2.5  So I checked how many times a player hit any of those qualifiers for a whole playoff run:  **30.0 PER or higher:**  LeBron James: 5 times  Michael Jordan: 4 times  Shaq: 3 times  No one else has done it more than twice  **0.270 WS/48 or higher:**  LeBron James: 5 times  Michael Jordan: 4 times  KAJ: 4 times  Dolph Shayes: 3 times  No one else has done it more than twice  **10.0 BPM or higher:**  LeBron James: 8 times  Michael Jordan: 8 times  Chris Paul: 4 times  Kawhi Leonard: 3 times  Tim Duncan: 2 times  No one else has done it more than once  **2.5 VORP or higher:**  LeBron James: 5 times  Michael Jordan: 5 times  No one else has done it more than once  Edit: I did a quick look at regular season impact stats, and Bron and MJ are alone at the top 2 in number of seasons with 30.0 PER, and seasons with 10.0 BPM, but for 0.270 WS/48, MJ is number 1 with Bron tied at third. However, if you bump the qualifier for WS/48 to 0.290, MJ and Bron end back up being tied for 1st again.

"He’s 35 rn. It’s LeBron James, you really think that one year is gonna end his career barring some injury? Not to mention how he’s shifted his game this year in the direction of longevity?"
"...yeah we got suuupper healthy. Only missing our starting sf, backup sf, and starting pf!  You have Anthony Davis and lebron James against a team that has to start an undrafted rookie and play Mario hezonja minutes. There’s no excuses"
"how is it a terrible take lol. If you believe that Lebron James is the GOAT over Jordan (which is the main argument for most people) how can you justify that after he gets bounced as the first seed in the first round of the playoffs. It doesn't matter how good the other team is, you are supposed to be (in this situation) the greatest player to ever play the game. You will have to beat good teams, if you can't you aren't the best.   I also still think Lakers win the series btw, just if they don't how does he have a valid argument for the greatest of all time after that? It's already a very close debate, what's the pro-lebron argument if he loses the series"
"I understand that you saw him dominate in March but, when you're a pro athlete in your mid-30s, you're aging at a faster rate as opposed to when your in your mid-20s. LeBron James is not the same player he was in 2019 let alone 2018."
"Listen here Mack, Lebron James is one of the best darn basketball players I've seen, ever, in the whole world let me tell you. I've been around basketball, I know it, hell those boys down at the swamp knew a thing or two about a thing or two where I was growing up, they could shoot boy, these were some real spring chickens, real shooters man. Chains on the hoops who cares, you brought a flat ball to the court you knew what the consequences were, you learn things from those experiences, shapes a young man, that's what America is, that's the message. Fact of the matter is Lebron James can really bust a move out there and I'm happy to have him on the campaign trail with me."
"https://cavaliersnation.com/2019/04/09/nba-players-vote-lebron-james-kobe-bryant-greatest-alltime/  Lebron voted as the GOAT by more players than Kobe, hard to guess what the MJ voters would have chosen as 2nd. And this is with the current generation of NBA players idolizing Kobe their entire lives growing up. The percentages for Kobe will only decrease as the generation who watched Lebron make the league."
"Lebron James has gone to more finals than he has missed. Every season you don't make it to the championships counts as worse than making it and losing. This whole view that it is better to be 5-0 than 6-3 has to end. You lost every time you didn't make it. Having said that, Jordan, West, whoever may be better than him, but to blatantly say he isn't top 5 is just silly. Especially from a B Rated player that had to form a superteam to beat the guy when the guy was only 23."
y’all keep clowning about this but his hand was quite [obviously swollen](https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/06/11/lebron-james-hand-injury-photographic-investigation/amp/)
"Bro, those numbers are not good for a prime time game featuring Lebron fucking James and the Lakers.     In 2018, Pacers/Cavs game 1 of the first round drew 5.9 million viewers. The leagues ratings are tanking."
"The franchise that drafted Paul Pierce: 16 NBA championships prior to 98-99. Clearly no proven success or championship pedigree.  The franchise that drafted LeBron James: 0 NBA championships, and not even a single NBA Finals APPEARANCE  Yes very comparable franchises great points friendo"
"Wasn't just in the Finals, [he changed his game in Miami after 2011](https://grantland.com/features/how-lebron-james-transformed-game-become-highly-efficient-scoring-machine/) and worked with Hakeem"
"no not at all. I actually think that's totally fine. What makes lebron specifically a hypocrite is this statement by him   &gt;""I want the satisfaction. Not for myself, but for everybody else. I was raised off of [rappers] Snoop [Dogg] and [Tupac] and [Jay-Z] and Biggie [Smalls], and now I get an opportunity to be the inspiration around what all of these kids are looking up to? And for me to just sit back and not say s--- when a lot of my peers didn't say s---? It didn't feel right.               ""At the end of the day, when I decided I was going to start speaking up and not giving a f--- about the backlash or if it affects me, my whole mindset was it's not about me,"" James added. ""... My popularity went down. But at the end of the day, my truth to so many different kids and so many different people was broader than me personally.""  and then the type of ""cultural icon"" he fancies himself as. He thinks he's ali when really he has none of the principal he's claiming to stand on. It's all just money motivated and the china situation highlights that.   do you understand why he's such a poser in the eyes of many now? OF COURSE he cares about the backlash, he ONLY speaks or ""takes a stand"" when it's the popular marketable thing to do and that makes him a disgusting human being in my eyes, even though he's a great basketball player, but the level of arrogance you have to have to act like he does is insane to me. He's totally lost my respect because of how he handles China. Realistically the only thing he could do is come out and issue an apology at this point saying ""I've been a huge hypocrite and I was only trying to do what was popular, I realized that when someone would potentially cost me millions of dollars to do the right thing I wasn't willing to do it and for that I'm sorry"" or something like that. He'll never do it, but make no mistake, he knows exactly what kind of person he is.   Regular black dudes who are angry about the American justice system and don't pretend to be something they are not make perfect sense and I stand with them."
"""LeBron James is not a top 5 player of all-time... But I am!"" - Paul Pierce"
"I was going nuts.  I don't know how none of the commentators said anything about this.  There were 30 seconds left, and you have Lebron James."
Carmelo Anthony &gt; LeBron James
"In accordance with their respective performances in the 'NBA Bubble', I'm inclined to agree that Damian Lillard is, in fact, greater than LeBron James currently."
"Post play fucking sucks in the modern NBA and is super exhausting. There's a reason it's been phased out in favour of perimeter attacks. Joel Embiid is a monstrous post player and even he isn't able to carry an offense by himself in 2020.  On top of that, LeBron is one of the greatest passers and rim attackers in the history of the game. Plopping him in the post would be a waste of his talents. The threat of a LeBron James drive is enough to suck in multiple defenders and get his teammates great looks that they otherwise might not have."
"Lmao, Klay Thompson instead of Wiggins might be enough in that deal. It’s 2 years of LeBron James which you get to have with Steph freaking Curry"
"Idk how anyone can sit there in their right mind and say LeBron James is not a top 5 player of all time. He’s top 2, top 3 if you wanna put Wilt above him go ahead. But to say he’s not top 5 is just straight ignorance."
"Let's try this again: Who is the best balding player in the world, and why is it Joe Ingles?   And don't you dare say Lebron James again!"
"&gt;What does this even mean?  I'm not sure where the confusion is. As I explained elsewhere:  ""Paul Pierce was a better competitor than LeBron James. Not sure what the confusion is. If you imagine any competitive endeavor and equalize their respective talent levels, Pierce would prevail thanks to TWTW."""
"You mean my opinion? My opinion is a point guard is a willing passer. And james harden is not. Nba players know it. Nba analyst know it too. And you cant just based it on assist. Kobe average 5 assist in his career. Would you call him a willing passer? Lebron averages 7.5 assist in his career would you view him as a point guard? You see, its not always about how many assist you dish out each game. Being a point guard means setting plays, being the floor general and making everyone around you better."
"Paul Pierce was a better competitor than LeBron James. Not sure what the confusion is. If you imagine any competitive endeavor and equalize their respective talent levels, Pierce would prevail thanks to TWTW."
"To he fair, one was against the juggernaut of the Lakers and Lebron James. Better story than Harden and the Rockets, in all honesty, beating a team they should with older CP3 as the lead. Most people probably feel this way also. Dame drops 35 in an expected loss and I bet it's barely talked about  To me the disrespect was even giving CP3/Thunder as much of a chance as reddit/social media did, not to discredit the Thunder in any way either. They kicked ass in a tough West."
LEBron is taking this king James shit way too seriously
"Not sure what people expect, but no, 35 year old LeBron James will not drop 40 every single game, especially with 2 7-foot bigs clogging the paint for 80% of the game.  Also, LeBron was mostly really good last night, he controlled the game with his playmaking and could’ve had 20+ assist if the “shooters” actually hit a shot here and there."
"/u/Arkham_Ferguson /u/spidersilva09 /u/MeridianBae /u/erjam /u/BytesBite i found op's essay  From San Antonio to Toronto to Los Angeles, Kawhi Leonard's NBA career is already the stuff of legend. The two-time champion and FMVP has been through a lot of drama and controversy to get to where he is now. However, looking at his career path, I couldn't help but feel like I had seen this story before somewhere...  Kawhi Leonard's career/Cars  Our story begins with a young rising Star who many predict will be the future of the sport for years to come (Kawhi/Lightning McQueen). However, the Star faces a major setback in the late stages of competition which keeps him from fulfilling his true potential for the moment (Kawhi's injury in the WCF/McQueen's mechanical failure which causes him to tie in the last race even though he could have won). The Star is extremely frustrated, and tensions begin to build with the organization he represents (The Spurs/Rust-Eze).  The Star forces his way out of his current team (requesting a trade/firing his crew chief), and his only priority is getting to LA as quickly as possible (to play for his hometown team/to compete in the final race). He forces (the Spurs front office/Mack the big-rig) to get him there, but things go wrong and he instead ends up somewhere he never expected to be (Toronto/Radiator Springs).  The Star is forced to work with a new group of people he isn't familiar with, in a place that has been kept from success by some existential force (LeBron James/the passage of time and urbanization). These new people include an uncompromising keeper of the peace who keeps everyone in line (Nick Nurse/the Sheriff), an aging competitor whose short prime was ruined by injury (Jeremy Lin/Doc Hudson), an attractive companion who becomes his biggest cheerleader (Drake/Sally), and a friendly sidekick with some odd talents and a substantially sized posterior (Kyle Lowry/Tow Mater).  While our Star is initially uncomfortable here, he is able to find success when he finally accepts that he needs the help of these strange characters if he wants to win. This place (the Toronto Raptors/Radiator Springs) has not seen success in a long time, and the Star is finally able to get them what they are looking for (an NBA Championship/putting the town back on the map).  But our story doesn't end there.  Kawhi Leonard's Career/Cars 2  By now, the Star has achieved what he wanted all along (playing in LA/international stardom). This gives him the opportunity to compete directly against the best in the world (LeBron James/Francisco Bernoulli).  The Star's companion (Kyle Lowry/Tow Mater) feels like he has to prove himself alone now. The duty falls upon him to help lead a very skilled group that most people don't know about (the players the Raptors develop in the G-League/secret agents). But will he crack under the pressure?  While competition continues, it remains to be seen whether or not the Star will continue dominating the competition. And perhaps there's some conspiracy going on behind the scenes perpetrated by league's higher-ups (Miles Axelrod/the shitty refs)?  Maybe after this is all over, Kawhi will become a mentor for some new rookie, to mirror the plot of Cars 3? Who knows at this point, but it's clear to me that whoever writes the NBA script decided to plagiarize Pixar for whatever reason.  (i just searched thru op's history and used removeddit to get the deleted content)"
https://howtheyplay.com/team-sports/Michael-Jordan-Versus-LeBron-James  So what’s this? Facts are facts. Lebron has hit more of those shots on a better percentage than MJ
Yes he does? A third title matching James and with a third different team would be something LBJ hasn’t done. Lebron would still be ranked higher for now IMO but it makes the argument have some merit vs rn it has none
Steph has won more championships than Giannis has playoff series.   For me the top 5 are: 1. Lebron James 2. James Harden 3. Steph Curry 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo
i mean you don't just deserve to win because the recent great from your team passed away this year in a tragic accident. It's still an achievement that is suppose to be earned. Which i think is the inherent problem in this. People don't like Lebron because they don't feel he's had to earned anything the same way his predecessors had to. He's been silver-spoon grown in the nba while flaunting an imagine of hard work pays off. If the lakers win 4-1in some reoccurring bogus ref bullshit it is gonna make Hypocrite James even harder to stomach.
top 15  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. LeBron James  3. Kawhi Leonard  4. James Harden  5. Anthony Davis  6. Paul George  7. Joel Embiid  8. Damian Lillard  9. Jimmy Butler  10. Luka Doncic  11. Jayson Tatum  12. Russel Westbrook  13. Kyrie Irving  14. Nikola Jokic  15. Devin Booker

"LeBron James and Kobe weren’t as popular as Michael Jordan. Hell, even today more people know MJ than either those those guys.   Frankly I don’t think any future basketball player will be as well known as MJ or even LeBron"
38.0 points per 100 possessions on 62.6% TS in the regular season (since he started making the playoffs in 2009-2010).   36.9 points per 100 possessions on 59.7% TS in the playoffs during the same time period.  So yeah a touch worse but nothing crazy. I think it could be chalked up to playing more minutes (36.9 in regular season versus 40.3 in playoffs) and just playing a really good team game after game in the playoffs versus playing weaker teams in the regular season.  The same goes for all players.  EDIT: The only players to score more points per 100 possessions in the playoffs than Kevin Durant are Michael Jordan (43.3) and LeBron James (37.2).
"Only one player besides Lebron James had more than 1 assist yesterday. Caruso had 3, and three other guys had 1. Lebron had 16/22 assists. This team NEEDS another ball handler. I get Rondo may not be the best player anymore, but dude always plays better in the playoffs and still has the ability to penetrate the defense.   I haven't watched enough to know for sure, but why do the Lakers not play Quinn Cook? He has experience hitting shots in big games. 40% from three in 2 seasons with Golden State and 36% this year. I just feel if your team is shooting 5/32 from 3, you should probably try to get a different guy in there for a bit."
Loved this article on Dame and how he (and by extension his team) approaches the game and team loyalty differently than other superstars https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/damian-lillard-out-to-show-lebron-james-lakers-that-running-from-the-grind-is-for-chumps-not-champs/
Lol LeBron doesn't loose in the 2nd round. Did Rockets fans really think Harden (who has one of the worst playoffs reputations ever) would lead them to a win against LEBRON JAMES?
AD is playing with LeBron James. He should honestly be disqualified from these types of things including all NBA.
"Dude come on, I’m not trying to get into a big fight about James harden but when you guys start throwing his name around with guys like Jordan Kobe Lebron then he will get nitpicked. Anyways it’s really not nitpicking, it’s not occasionally it’s routinely that he comes up very small in big playoff moments. He’s a great player but he is flawed. Just let him be a great player, when people start putting his name with the best players the league has seen it invites criticism"
"seriously they forget these guys have lebron james and ad. a sweep, hell even a 5 game series is pretty unlikely. this is a 6 or 7 gamer that could go either way imo"
The anomaly you speak of is Lebron James. And it is a very relevant anomaly.
And here we are seeing Lebron James in the side bar instead of Middleton.

Lmao do you know who Lebron James is?
I still really like James Johnson. He's budget LeBron with some substance use.
"Nice reaction from the Lakers with a duo LeBron James and Anthony Davis at the top.  Morris has finally woken up, and that's good.  Nice match from Rondo as well which will be important in this series."
Because he's playing LeBron James and DPOY candidate Anthony Davis.
"Lebron ""Saul Goodman"" James"
LeBron “All in good hands” James
There are two players by the name of AD and Lebron that lick there lips when they see Westbrook cut. I think he's hitting 3s cuz cutting is dead on arrival with AD and James on the floor.
Lebron james: get the fuck out of here russ you suck tonight.  Russ: well how about i shoot more threes? But make them.
"Ad scored more, why put Lebron James in the title? AD had 10 rebounds himself."
"I think he'll be fine if he only has to red line his engine every so often, but he can't do that for too long imo. Idk he's still LeBron James so I'm sure he can still exceed most people's expectations"
"Why do teams insist on ""coaching"" LeBron James? He knows what needs to be done. No one in the building has a better idea of who should do what on the court than he does. I'd love to see him be a player/coach, write up plays, etc. Everyone knows he pretty much runs the show anyway."
"Next day some guy to his Laker fans boss about the game:   ""The @Lakers tonight led by their two superstars, LeBron James with 28 points and AD with 34, tied the series 1-1. The 4th quarter defense was superb and they got strong contributions from their bench led by Rajon Rondo, Kyle Kuzma, and Markieff Morris."""

comment about LeBron James
35 year old LeBron James really played nearly 40 minutes in a must win playoff game. It would take Bud two games plus an overtime to get him those minutes
“Lebron James with no regard for human life.”
Lebron.   James.

“What?! You can’t call fouls on me! I’m Lebron James! That’s not allowed!”
Anthony Davis/LeBron James/Markieff Morris  **BIG 3**
LEBRON JAMES WITH THE REJECTION!
"You feel like it because you are massively ignorant and desperately want to believe your original comment wasn't laughably so. I'm not wrong, you don't even understand the premise of my reply still, and you still cannot even answer who owns ESPN. And contending that James is an ""on-air talent"" for ESPN when he's employed by an NBA franchise is especially laughable.  Let me simplify it for you, since you're never going to get there on your own: ESPN is an albatross around Disney's neck, who is hemorrhaging money on them and has been for five years. It's not coincidence so much of their previous talent has gone elsewhere, since they had to let them go because they couldn't afford to pay them. Their content is a flop, and they are unprofitable because of it, and a large part of that when it comes to the NBA is because of the way they make everything about LeBron. So acting as if he is so compelling because of how much he's featured and how much content is generated ABOUT him, not by him, is a metric of how successful the approach is, is insane, because it's not making them money. The ratings decline and unprofitability of half of the franchises in the league are a testament to that, since ABC/ESPN are the driving force behind the marketing of the league."
I literally am Lebron James
Lebron James is the greatest gift to mankind since sliced bread
Over under LeBron James 10 blocks on Russ in the series

Not to be dramatic but Lebron James alley-oop dunks are better than sex.

Lebron james with 2 points in the fourth quarter!
WHERE IS LEBRON JAMES
"Authors write about him for their careers. Producers use his story to create news, not to mention he has produced multiple things. Saying the best nba player playing games on national tv isn't an onair talent is ignorant at best. Lebron James generates content, and might be the most popular player in the league. I never mentioned revenue in my original post. Lebron James news/stories/podcasts/articles/show segments/games generates content that fans love to consume.   Be reasonable here, you're wrong. I feel like you know it too but you're just tripling down on your take."
"James Harden is everything LeBron isn’t   - no tattoos  - not political  - never acts sanctimonious  - never tries to act smarter than he is  - never tried to make himself an institution  - doesn’t care about his image, goes to strip clubs and makes no apologies about it"
Lebron James   We’ll stop shooting 3s if you sacrifice him
"LeBron James can remember every single play in the game, but he can't remember LeBron James form the last time he shot free throws."
LeBron James Harden there lol.

Total sidenote but I'm crying at the thought of a KC Chiefs offense featuring Mahomes/CEH/Tyreek/Kelce/LEBRON JAMES

LeBron James: I sleep  Meerkat Morris: Real shit
i can’t believe a team with lebron james and anthony davis are considered a bad half court team
Does LeBron James find it exhausting having to face a good team BEFORE reaching the NBA Finals?
Harden's kidding if he thinks they're going to overturn that on LeBron James
"Wow... James changed the call.... LeBron used to do that, now it's the other James doing it"
"""I expect a more energized Lebron James""  Inb4 he becomes narcoleptic."
Yeah but the one that was happened to be Lebron fucking James
I in just want everyone to take just a minute just a single MINUTE and imagine if Lebron James was in the exact same position as Giannis right now lol
"&gt;""Spread love around the world""   \- Lebron James  They must have played this 20 times.   Oh and obviously, spread love ""around the world"" only when it doesn't hurt your wallets."
"""Lebron, or is it LeChoke versus Houston in Game 1, would never take those shots that Tyler HERO not only took but made against Milwaukee Sunday afternoon. James was lucky to have Ray"" Jesus Shuttleworth"" Allen as his savior versus the Great Greg Popovich and my San Antonio Spurs!"

Khris “Kawhi “LeBron James” Leonard” Middleton
NO CLUTCH GENE!!! LEBRON RAYMONE JAMES WOULD NEVER
"They absolutely were. But the Hawks didn't have a LeBron James to help shoulder the missing load. They were a team that played great when their starters and sixth an were all healthy, but really only Horford and Teague were healthy."
"I’m pretty sure I made it clear at this point, but my case is:  Bill Russell is one of the greatest of all time. Like, as good as Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kareem Abdul Jabaar  Watching his games, his offense is basically nothing. He doesn’t create anything. He gets offensive rims and literally, *sometimes* finishes around the rim. Nobody else in the goat conversation offers basically nothing on offense.  On defense, I really feel like his influence is drastically overrated. I really think maybe big men were so bad at the time, that having a guy that knew what he was doing (I said before that I think Bill had the talent of a modern D1 center, but not an NBA guy) was enough to drastically improve your defense. Watching him play, he doesn’t even influence half of the possessions he’s involved in on defense. It was a different era, but he was not 60s version of Dwight Howard or Giannis or Shaq or Kareem. He didn’t influence the game like, even close to those guys.   I know the numbers, I know the stories about him. I’m talking, if Bill Russell in 1965 was teleported to present day high school games, I don’t think he’d be recruited to top colleges, let alone make it to the NBA...that’d be a stretch.  I said it before, this is not me trying to win some argument. I’m trying to talk to somebody about how insane it is that he was so, not what everybody says he was. Basketball just sucked in the 60s and there’s probably a handful of players that were really, legitimately good. Wilt was on another stratosphere than everyone else in the league at the time. The Celtics were just stacked."
"Yes they are number way below a max contract?? Does he look like a James harden, klay thompson, lebron, Leonard, Kevin Durant? He’ll no. Kris Middleton isn’t bad but his defensive is absurd and he’s shaky on offense. Do u think this guy is worth a max contract? He’s an overhyped player who can only play offense half the time. He’s just not the player they need to support Giannis"
"“Good stats” is under stating it. Westbrook had “stats” for his mvp, James harden had “stats” for the last few years. This is so beyond stats...   Those are ALL TIME stats as well as the DPOY defense with the number 1 offensive and defensive team that won the most games. There is no argument that they flamed out but it’s stupid to say he didn’t deserve it.   LeBron also plays with AD who is also a MVP/DPOY candidate himself  and Giannis plays with Middleton. Usually you have to chose between: stats or wins and team Offensive and Defensive efficiency. Giannis has all of that"
Top 5 players left in the bubble:  (1) Kawhi   (2) LeBron   (3) James Harden   (4) Anthony Davis  (5) Jimmy Butler
Is Lebron James speak Cantonese?
Is Lebron James as good as MJ?
"MJ came into the league in 84. He got eliminated in 84,85,86,87,88, 89 and 90. The pistons and Celtics whupped his ass every time. LeBron took that sorry ass 2007 Cavs team to the finals at age 22.  Jordan scored 60+ in one game against the Celtics and still lost. It don’t matter how great you are... you ain’t gonna win by yourself. It is a team sport.   Let’s talk about the 6 finals MJ was in. He went against the Lakers the first time. That was Magic’s last season and he had AIDS. James worthy and Byron Scott were out of that series because they were hurt. So it was MJ against a sorry lakers team.   Next year he went against Portland. They didn’t have nobody except Clyde Drexler and Kevin Duckworth (who??) and Jerome kersey. Pathetic   Next year he went against the Suns. They had Charles Barkley and who else? Kevin Johnson and Dan Majerle? That ain’t no competition.   Then he leaves to play baseball and Scottie Pippen still manages 55 wins and goes to the playoffs and takes them to the ECF.   Then he came back and played the Seattle SuperSonics. Who did they play beat? Nobody.. went to the finals once and played Gary Payton. Pathetic   Then he played against a 34 and 35 year old John Stockton and Karl Malone? That’s who he went up against?? A old ass Utah team? Pathetic   It don’t matter if he went 6x to the finals. LeBron done it 9x already.   Then the same team that beat the lakers in 2004... LeBron beat that same team by himself! Nobody on his team.   It don’t matter if LeBron got swept by the spurs. If Jordan had managed to get to the finals in 89 he would have got his ass whupped by the showtime lakers. Facts.   Jordan was good but he used to kick it out to Paxon (money). Kick it out to Bj Armstrong (money) kick it out to Steve Kerr (money!!) Scottie Pippen best two way player during that era."
"Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, Kareem, Tim Duncan, Oscar Robertson, Magic, Larry Bird, Bill Russell."
I'm only half joking when I say that Kawhi Leonard and Lebron James have been two of the most impactful GM's of this season.
"&gt;Lebron James frustrated, complains to Frank Vogel “there’s no Stephen.”"
"&gt; Lakers were well past it, the 92 Blazers were an LOL, the 93 Suns were an awesome regular season team which didn’t have the talent to compete in a finals series, the 96 Sonics were an LOL (embarrassing for the Bulls that they even brought it to 6 if we’re being honest), and the 97-98 Jazz were best in the regular season.  Kinda nice how you try to discredit every single one of the team's Michael faced. The '91 Lakers were Top 5 in offense and defense, Magic finished 2nd in MVP voting (and was a better player than anyone LeBron has ever faced), James Worthy (a HoFer and Finals MVP i might add) had his 2nd best season and all their starters averaged double digits, but they were ""well past it"", sure.   '96 Sonics just had three All-Stars (Kemp, Schrempf, GP), won 64 games, had the DPOY, but were a ""LOL"", sure kid.   I don't care how good the 2014 Spurs and the KD Warriors were, he didn't beat them, in fact he won 2 out of 14 games against these teams, what does it matter that Jordan didn't face a team as good? He beat everyone in his path, that's not his fault.  &gt; You really shouldn’t bring up regular-season stats as an argument for Jordan. LeBron does have the better statistical resume (it’s one of the few things indisputably in Bron’s favor).  No, it isnt. Jordan averages more points/blocks/steals, higher PER, higher WS/48, higher FT%, OBPM, DPBM and BPM. Michael also has more MVPS, DPOYs and seasons leading a statistical category. The only thing LeBron has on Michael are counting stats due to having played longer. Great that he averages more rebounds, he is 3 inches taller, he should.  &gt; So the big black mark on LeBron’s career is 2011. And although people unfairly discount the times when Jordan didn’t even make it to the finals at all, Jordan never played as badly in an important series as LeBron did in 2011.  Jordan also never played as bad as LeBron did in the 2007 Finals, regardless of how outmatched his team was, he also never played as bad as the 2010 ECSF.  The problem with folks on this sub is that most of you didn't watch LeBron in his first stint in Cleveland and therefore don't understand the magnitude of his failures from pre-2012, yall can only see the champion LeBron and not all the failures he had before he got to that point, which is something Michael didn't have."
Lebron James has been shooting the 3 at 42% on 5.8 attempts per game this postseason.  He's the definition of icy hot from the 3. He goes from 40% one season to less than 35% the next.   He shoots at 33.4% for his career in the post season. Weirdly mediocre.
He was never that good. He did well on Spurs and Toronto because the teams were stacked.  He won fmvp because of he could just do his thing and be a good defender but now he has to be the best with shitty help and he can't do that. He's not LeBron or KD or Steph or James harden or Damian Lillard. He's more of a Kyrie
"6th man just means the best player in the league that is not a regular starter.  &gt; To be eligible for the award, a player must come off the bench in more games than he starts  That's it. You could literally have Lebron James never start a single game, but sub him in a minute after every start and have him play +35min/game afterwards and he'd still qualify for the 6th man. In your example, both players came off the bench more time than they started a game this season. Therefore both qualify to be considered 6th man candidates.  That's why people would criticize awarding Lou Will so many times. It's that he arguably a starter calibre player but Clippers pretty much use him as a bench player because it's advantageous to play him against the opponent's bench players. But the guy is putting up some big minutes as a bench player (28minutes this season and 29.4 minutes last year)."
"On that fouling average, he would average 4.7 fouls per game at 40 minutes. Average, meaning he would often be over that. That means he'd often be out of the game at the end. Better hope it's garbage time.   Look at the playoff minutes for all teams, and see who the top 5 are, (none of which are playing 40 for the whole playoffs by the way) it's Brogdon, SGA, McCollum, TJ Warren, and Gobert. They're the only players to avg more than 38.5 in the playoffs this year. Know what else they have in common? They're all home because they lost.  He's playing 4 minutes more per game vs the Heat than he did in the previous round. (35.7 this round vs 31.7 last round) His minutes have raised. He's just not a 40-min per game player. Over the last three games, he's playing more minutes than LeBron, AD, Westbrook, Jokic, Eric Gordon, and dozens more. He's playing within 1 minute of Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Chris Paul, James Harden, and Tobias Harris. The minutes narrative is weak.  Make some free throws or make some improvements to the scheme. But just ""play Giannis more"" is not a strategy. Bud has played giannis more, and they're losing."
Don't compare this trash can to LeBron James lol
"I forgot to mention T-Mac, Jason Kidd, Arenas, Baron Davis, Billups, Deron Williams. They all had spectacular seasons during the 00s. I was just talking about SG's. But I agree with you guard play is higher in today's game.  Wade didn't have good enough teams to put him in the conversation for MVP after his finals MVP. Before CP3 Harden teams had teams with complimentary players while Wade essentially had a lottery team. And LeBron joining his team erased any chance of MVPs but he sacrificed individual acolates for team success.   The fact is there is a significant gap on defense. Put rings and individual awards aside I gotta go with Wade because of his two way play. If James wins a ring and has a healthy next few years I will still have to put him in as 3B because he wasn't the defender Wade was. Wade has 3 rings but in 2012 he was still a superstar and helped LeBron too. In 2013 LeBron definitely carried but 2012 LBJ needed Wade. Remember that's the season Bosh missed half the playoffs and played less mins."
"&gt; He was like Kobe + Klay in his younger days  Kind of. He didn't really crack down on defense; but was often called on to do a lot on offense. (more than Klay, slightly less than Kobe)  Ray had a [bit](https://in.nba.com/news/kobe-bryant-biggest-individual-rivalries-best-moments-top-plays-michael-jordan-lebron-james/1dpjmfuose7x71hyqgz5c2ujus) of [rivalry](https://youtu.be/cWrMvQEYVCA?t=201) going on with Kobe at one time.   Also his teams weren't in the limelight as much."
"because ""6th"" doesn't really mean that he has to be 6th on the depth chart. It means he is not a starter and that applies to more than one person on every team...it's just that very few teams have multiple people who can put up numbers that could compete in an award that is essentially just MVP for non-starters. This is not different than Lebron James and AD being candidate for MVP or even Steph and KD if you prefer.  At least, that's how I interpret it."
"Absolutely not. Casey underachieved year over year, getting swept by Randy Wittman's Wizards when we were the better team, going to 7 games consistently with lower seeds when we were the highest seed in the East, and his inability to adjust just wasn't working in the playoffs. And it's not like some small sample size...he consistently did it year after year until Masai literally yelled at him about keeping guys accountable on defense.   Brad Stevens has gotten more out of less, is a great X's and O's coach, and pushed LeBron James to 7 games in the ECF, a feat in and of itself. His ability to game plan and adjust is top 5 in the league.   You also have to remember that he's done it consistently short handed and with a variety of different rosters.   Brad's a stud and you should feel bad for equating him to Casey."
"05-11 he was considered top 3 with Kobe and LeBron. This was the consensus. And he ways also the top of the league those years in PER and fourth quarter scoring. He didn't make it out the first round 07 after the championship because that team was old and then they tanked a season and traded for expiring contracts like Jermaine O'Neal so they can have more cap space. He forced a game 7 vs a way deeper atl team while averaging 29 ppg and his second leading scorer? James Jones with 9 ppg. Next year he lost to the big 3 Celtics while averaging 33 ppg and the second year in a row in the playoffs were his second leading scorer was under 10 ppg. Those teams Wade lost in the first round with should've not even been in the playoffs but Wade carried them with no help. His first 3 years he made it to the semis, ecf then won a ring. If they didn't sell out for LeBron and Bosh cap space in 2008 maybe they could have build complimentary pieces around Wade those few years but he sacrificed so the franchise can have an opportunity to land LeBron and Bosh and put his individual stats aside.  Edit: also defense. How many defense teams has Harden made? Offensively Harden has an argument but it's close but defense? He isn't in the same universe as Wade."
"They do the same thing with Lebron, you think the nba is letting Lebron get fouled out of a playoff game?? The dude tackled someone tonight off ball when he got knocked into them off ball and nothing was called because it’s Lebron James. Y’all gotta jump through some mental gymnastics to think the league is fixing games against Lebron James and the lakers."
"Idk man I know people from all walks of life that dislike LeBron James. The more successful you are, the more haters you will naturally have."
"Nothing against the Lakers, but I want to see Dwight Howard lose.  Mocking the Nuggets after the Game 2 win was bush league and angered the basketball Gods.  Also LeBron James shading Marc Gasol's DPOY win from 7 years ago was bush league.  Why these guy tempt the basketball Gods, I'll never know."

lebron james the next la county sheriff confirmed?
"Looking at stats emptily is fucking stupid  Besides 2011, lebron is justified for 5 of his losses because he played quite literally a 1v5 or 2v5  2007 he went against Tim duncan, Manu, Tony Parker, coached by popovich, 58-24 record, Tim Duncan averaged 18.5ppg and 11.5 rebounds, Tony Parker had 24.5ppg and Manu had 17.8ppg, and they smacked the 61 win Steve Nash Suns, and no, he averaged 22 points a game dumbass, either he way he got locked up because that's one of the all time best teams in history  Who did MJ play in his first finals? Same record Lakers team lead by an aging Magic Johnson averaging on 18.6 points and James worthy, who averaged 19.6, vlade divac and Sam Perkins averaged like 17 and 16, nothing, but that team played through weak teams, the rockets, warriors and blazers  2014 Lebron averaged 28.2opg while Dwade literally fell from a cliff on his knees and alongside Ray Allen, Mario Chalmers scored half as much points as they did the series before only on worse efficiency, and Chris bosch was literally the only other good player  2015 the Warriors played a cavs team without kyrie and Klove, and Lebron averaged 35.8ppg, and a managed to make Delevedova look good and take them to 6 game  Those warriors alone are better then any team MJ faced, you can not argue this  2017 KD had to ruin the nba, and despite this Lebron still dropped 33.6ppg in a 2v5 against KD, Steph, Klay, Draymond and Iguodola, that's the best team of all time  And in 2018 he willed one of the most god awful finals teams since 2007 and averaged 34 points against the best team in history, including dropping 51 points, and that's after carrying the team through the whole playoffs in two 7 game series and making the raptors look like a G-League team, he was a one man army  And now going onto stats  I explained why the rungs are misleading, MJ had easier opponents and never had success as a lone player and Lebron dominated alone even against mugch beteer teams, just got cursed with having shit/injured teammates when it matters most, stop touting that as an argument, Bill Russel has one extra ring on his toe, he's the GOAT  And the FMVP ratio would be alot different if the losing teams player could also get it, he would have quite literally 8 of them, but 5 of them AR elosses against much better teams while he himself was the best player on the court  And the DPOY arguement is shit, LeBron should have one but Marc Gasol who was 2nd all defense got it, doesn't make sense, it was a robbery plain and simple  Scoring Titles I can give, LeBron was never focused on scoring"

This is my favorite description of Kuzma.  &gt; The idea of Kuzma is much greater than the reality of Kuzma  https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/kyle-kuzma-trade-rumors-los-angeles-lakers-lebron-james-2020
Lebron James would have 2 rings if it weren't for Kyrie Irving. And a main reason why they made the ECF in 2018 was because Kyrie lead a celtics team which lost Hayward on the 1st game of the season to 56 wins and the 1st seed. Harris meanwhile averaged 18 and 5 this season while being the second best player on a 3rd seed.
"As a person born into a Bulls family, I USED to hate James bc it was blasphemous when he was called the new MJ out of high school. Just pitted me against him. I used to root against him just bc there's never going to be another Jordan.  Few years ago my friend who is a Heat fan said ""you're going to regret not being able to enjoy Lebron's greatness once he's done. And he was right. But still, MJ is on his own. Lebron is not MJ."
"You speak as though you disregard common sense because you hate a team so much that you deny reality to hate on them. If you really think the Nuggets are winning this series, then you don’t know LeBron James, or how his teams normally operate in the playoffs."
Which one of those players is better than Lebron James hell which one of those players is better than AD Gary Payton(I would take AD but maybe)
It’s crazy to think that Magic did *all that* in 11 years   LeBron James is in his 17th year and still hasn’t caught up yet
"Really tho? Ad is a lot like jokic minus the playmaking and he is good enough out of the double team to find open shooters the lakers have many, he is also a good three point shooter and forcing harrel and zubac out of the paint is the reason jokic dominated and ad is just as good and has more athleticism which would obviously lead to a worse matchup. LeBron james they have almost no one that can stop him let's be honest on that, kawhai is no longer the defensive juggernaut he is and lebron is one of the worst players you can double considering his height and how great of a passer he is. On the lakers side doubling leonard was effective as he isn't a great playmaker and the lakers are good closing to three pointers as seen in the houston series, considering how many the clippers took in late game situations the lakers are suited to defend that. Ad  athleticism is also a huge factor in defense as they wouldn't have been able to exploit him as much as they did jokic with the pick and roll because he is also a better perimeter defender. If they played with two bigs they can have ad on paul george or leonard to further decrese there effectiveness. So what matchups you believe they win"

How is smuckers similar to lebron James? I’m confused
"&gt;Fantastic playmakers   Lonzo in the full court is probably the best playmaker in the league not named Lebron James but he’s a 3&amp;D guy in the half court. It’s a pick and roll heavy league &amp; he’s extremely lacking in that area, picking up another guard that can operate that opens up the offense.  Rondo’s a far better floor general &amp; not really a shooter, don’t see the comparison if we’re talking specifics. it’s bland"
Jerami “Lebron James” Grant
Why is Lebron playing only 25 minutes so far? Vogel can't be playing Lebron James the same minutes as KCP in a playoff game. He should have 30 at least by now.
lebron james in the octagon is a pretty scary sight if he actually trains for a fight. But i wanna see silva or jon jones fight this guy one time.
a nugget of advice- play lebron james
"Lebron ""the salesman"" James"
Jerami Grant can take LeBron James off the dribble. Imagine saying that on the process Sixers
And the nominees for best actor are: Lebron James and Nikola Jokic!

"Yes you figured it out, Lebron James is a shitty basketball player.   He had us all fooled"
Uhh I’d rather have in the regular season too. He’s Lebron James. A proven champion.
I don't mind no Dwight if you're playing small. But they're playing Rondo with James and no ad and just looks clogged plus have no shooting with LeBron.  Just horrible lineups
Yes and Lebron James never gets calls.
We should make an army of Lebron James clones and invade Australia
I honestly believe we should clone Lebron James a bunch of times until there’s one that can play every sport
I would lick Lebron James toilet after taco tuesday

LEBRON JAMES IS COBRANET
Well how many 5 seeds without LeBron James make the conference finals?
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."

"Holy shit, Lebron James and his son being in the league at the same time would be hilarious in kind of an amazing way. Imagine getting dunked on by your father who everyone worships."
"Oh, sure. They're a great franchise with excellent management and a long history of success. I just think there's a fundamental difference between picking LEBRON JAMES' LOS ANGELES LAKERS as your team and picking just about any other option. I don't think of Boston as a team with a disproportionate or noticeable amount of bandwagon fans."
"I don't know.  He is all-time NBA leaders in assists AND steals.    Those are records that may NEVER be broken.  For the assist record Jason Kidd is second and he was 3,715 assists away from just tying the record.  LeBron James has been in the NBA for 17 years and counting and he is 6,460 assists away from even tying the record.  Same thing for steals.  LeBron is 1,250 assists away from even tying John Stockton's record.  James could play another 17 years and he probably still wouldn't be able to catch Stockton.  Stockton was way underrated if anything."
"FT shooting is a clear weakness however the fact that he is a two time MVP and has led his team to a ring as the first option puts him ahead of AD who didnt even make it out the first round on his own  AD is playing with Lebron James, so of course he is looking even better than he usually is. Thats what happens when you play with Lebron"
James Harden deserves season MVP more than LeBron imo Sorry Grim Sleeper you're wrong.
"My best friend said the same thing. He wants anyone but 'Queen James' to win because if LeBron wins, in his words, it gives him ""more reason for people to call him the GOAT, but I don't want him to be the GOAT, so I don't want him winning anymore."" He hates LeBron more than any other player in sports that it triggers him when he's on ESPN."
"Michael Jordan, Yao Ming, LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kareem Abdul-Jabar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Bill Russel, Wilt Chamberlain, Kevin Durant, Shaq, Charles Barkley, and Kobe Bryant."
Windhorst was the first writer to cover LeBron bc he was a SVSM alum and he convinced his bosses to let him cover high school sports bc he knew LeBron James was a legit story. He later turned that into becoming the youngest NBA beat writer in the country.
Duke Zion was popular outside of NBA culture  He was the most hyped draft pick since Lebron James  I agree with Steph tho I forgot about him for a min
34 3p% dude im the biggest KD hater but he isnt a worse shooter than LeBron James
"What.... for one he was a writer in Cleveland, secondly if you have followed the earlier years of LeBron James you would know he wasn't just a ""prospect"" he was dominating competition from an early age and also grew into his athletic body before most kids could shave.  That shit is a lightbulb for any sports reporter."
"holy shit fully mask off. Chadwick had a lot of personal relationships with those in the NBA, LeBron James included. to suggest that he was remembered solely for being black is actually disgusting and that you would use it to discredit his memory is terrible."
"I don’t think people understand how truly large and athletic NBA players are, let alone Lebron freaking James. There is a point where size and agility completely overshadows skill."
Imagine fighting a ufc trained LeBron James
"A 73 win team added KD and almost lost to a team led by just an aging Chris Paul and James Harden. That’s impressive as fuck.   Who is impressed by Golden states title runs? Seriously, who? They added the second best player to the greatest regular season team of all time and cruised to the title. Just because they won doesn’t make it impressive.   If Lebron, KD, Steph, Dame, Harden, Kawhi, and AD teamed up and made a big 7, and ended up winning the title, it wouldn’t be seen as impressive. That’s an exaggerated example but the same implies here."
"I'm not saying Dirk wouldnt be good in this era, I'm saying Giannis wouldn't be better than Dirk in Dirk's era.  &gt;and I think you forgot about this guy named Lebron James he absolutely destroyed Dirks era with the same style o  Lebron couldn't even get past Dwight Howard's Magic in his era and didn't win a title in Dirk's era until he joined up with 2 other all NBA players AND he didn't even accomplish that until after losing head to head to Dirk's playstyle in 2011...so i'm not sure how you can argue Lebron's playstyle was better.   The gameplan for Lebron during Dirk's era was the same gameplan for Giannis now and it worked all the way up until 2012. 2011 is the best example of the superiority of Dirk's playstyle to Giannis/Lebron's playstyle in that era.  So i'm not sure how you think you can argue Lebron's playstyle ""absolutely destroyed"" when Dirk made it to the finals just as much as Lebron despite playing in a much more stacked conference.   If Dirk was in the East during that time, He'd be in the finals every other year at worst."
"Didn’t change anything? The Houston Rockets changed their entire offensive scheme, several times to try beat the warriors.  LeBron James had to change his game to include more 3s so he could even keep up with the Warriors and rest of the league  Lol I know I’m not a Warriors fan, but I’m also not going to ignore Curry and Warriors have impacted the game."
He was a free agent when the famous [poolside meeting](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/lebron-james-kevin-love-cavaliers-meeting-tristan-thompson/15cp62mlpvtlv1p2j26t8ht7iw) happened
"Spurs built what they had through a culture and lottery luck that included one of the best coaches of all time. No big name FA has gone to SA except LMA in the years since their incredible run. Cleveland literally had one of the GOATs that played in his hometown, do you think they would even have anything near this if LeBron James didn’t exist? Raps traded for Kahwi who left them a year after. None of these franchises have been able to consistently attract marquee free agents they can sign with the salary cap because players just don’t want to play there, they can easily go to a bigger market with cap room to sign them. There are always exceptions to this rule, but trying to make the argument of simply “draft well and develop and it will lead you to a chip” is pretty bogus. Big market teams with good ownership have a very high competitive advantage small markets can never attain under a fluid salary cap."
I stand by what I said ! If Karl Anthony Towns and Jokic can get their shot off Dirk could easily get his shot off and with all the shooters dirk would be way more open to driving hed be unstoppable ! and I think you forgot about this guy named Lebron James he absolutely destroyed Dirks era with the same style of play as Giannis
Trade Giannis for LeBron James

That's just magic of bron making his teammates better."

"I'll start with the DWS. Per 100 possessions DWS for these playoffs say Daniel Theis and Ivica Zubac played better defense than Bam, Gasol, and Brook Lopez. It says Joel Embiid played worse defensively than any center not named Whiteside. I'm not sure how to take that over this sample size, and I bet Jokic's defense has been rough, but they also played a nuclear Donovan Mitchell and then the Clippers.   As for them not being in the same tier what does he have to do to be considered in the same tier? Guys I would've considered consenus top 5 players from 2015-2020 I would probably say were LeBron, Steph, Harden, and KD. AD was not consensus 5th best throughout those years, and nobody would've ever said he was in the same tier as Bron and KD like so might've last year with Kawhi. Of the 4 guys I listed James Harden and LeBron both haven't missed top 4 since the 2015-16 season minus when LeBron missed time and the Lakers missed the playoffs. Steph and KD weren't getting those MVP votes, but they had won 3 combined MVPs before teaming up and then made the finals every year. Consensus top 5 guys are perennial MVP candidates or they're on teams so good that they eat each other's votes. AD has been perennial All-NBA and outside MVP candidate for the last 5 years just like Jokic has been for these last 2 seasons."
"&gt;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.  LeBron has always shared this as one of his favorite quotes. Just google ""LeBron James man in the arena"" and you'll see how he's referenced it many times throughout his career."
"He fucked up big time. He just ran to LeBron James as if  he was screening him in a totally nonsensical way. As someone who regularly watches basketball, it's one of the biggest mental breakdowns in cluctch situations I've ever seen if not the biggest. Its just unexplainable"
"What he paraphrases here is some shit logic though. ""you can't criticize person x because you've never been in their position""  Now change person x from Lebron James to some questionable world leaders"

"i think people took issue with it coming off pretentious, especially with how the media spun it. kinda like “at the end of the day, you’re still you and i’m still Lebron James. you’re still average and unimportant, most people won’t ever know you even exist, and I’m the greatest basketball player in the world. so go ahead and enjoy my losing because your lives will still suck tomorrow”.  I don’t think that is what he meant but I do at same time understand how people that dislike him or are even apathetic to him might assume the worst. After all, these superstar professional athletes are multi millionaires and famous all over the world, and most of us live mundane boring lives"
"I always thought about the LeBron James case. Arrived to the league at 240. Now is listed at 250. When he is a pure muscle beast.  And Pau Gasol, who is from my country, we weighed him at the Olympics, and when he played for Barcelona. He went to the states being an spaghetti. And he became a monster when he was on the Lakers. Besides... The guy is a legit 7'1. No way he is 113 Kilos, when I am 88 Kilos and I've seen him two meters away and he looks like a fucking beast.  In our country, the national team had him at 128 kilos (280 pounds??) when he supposedly was 113 (250 pounds).  Jayson Tatum now is strong. In theory he weighs 95Kilos. No way..."
Anthony davis rocks the playoffs w Lebron James
"I'm sorry that no one is even trying to answer, lol. IMO, NBA players are never doing one thing, and other NBA players know this. So when Lebron is executing those predictable and robotic post moves or hesitations, he might also be setting up a dribble drive or a skip pass or a dump off. Lebron is the most deadly drive threat in the game, as well as one of the best passers. So you have to take that into account when defending him. Also, it's much faster than it looks on TV. Even playing casual pickup games you'll notice that a turnaround J from the most average looking motherfucker still goes off pretty quick as long as they know how to execute. Lebron James is still top 3 in speed in explosion in the fastest and most explosive sport in the world."
&gt;Colby Covington  5'11 170 lb... Fucking Chris Paul could beat this dude's ass and he looks like a midget on the court. You're saying that pretend badass is going to talk shit to 6'9 250 lb Lebron james? gtfo
"Yeah, with Harden instead of AD, the Nuggets would have scored 120 and won the game easily.  But please tell me more about how great of a fit the dude who literally *never does anything off-ball* would be with LeBron James."
Lebron James!
I’m a laker fan why would I be worry about Lebron James in the East when we are going 17-55 with our squad? Lebron is top 2 all time even before coming to LA 😂🤦🏽
to trade for the 4th quarter playoff choker LeBron James
"Based off of what? Giannis playoff stats last year are still much better than the year you are talking about.  Than he lost in 5 games against the Warriors and one of those games was without Curry, what's the point here?  He's done more in the playoffs than AD has a first option. AD is also not exceeding expectations now either, he's playing with LEBRON JAMES.  That Celtics team was the higher seed, and the went on to take Lebron's Cavs to 7 games. Nothing was expected of that Bucks teams. If AD were to face that Raptors team with Kawhi, rest assured that team would not even go to     6 games, 5 games max. And it would be the same with this Heat team. AD is not first option on his team at all."
"Paxson wasn’t a tie. They were down 2 and he hit the game winning 3.  Kerr yeah sure was a tie when he hit the game winner, wanna know what other game was tied? The Kyrie game winner! Was a tie when he hit the shot. And also with almost a minute left on the clock. Interesting huh? And what happened right before that? BLOCKED BY JAMES.   The Ray Allen shot yes saved the series, but you can’t say Lebron shied away from it, he took a shot, just missed. He also dropped 32/10/11 in that game btw."
Lebron James has yet to win a playoff game against me
"Ehhh, any team with LeBron James will have a half court offense while he's on the court."
"Tyler Johnson is like, the Lebron James of the NBA"
"ALL of them are unique names and that entirely answers OP's question. Lebron, Luka, Zion, Steph, Kawhi, Giannis, Magic, Kyrie, Dame, Russ...all those guys are (I think) the only guys named that in the nba.   No one calls KD Kevin because there are other Kevins.  No one calls James Harden James because you might be talking about Lebron.  Shai will get the same first name treatment. If your first name is unique and you're of note then you will get first name treatment."
"Most players called by their first names have unique first names.  LeBron. Giannis. Zion. Luka. Kyrie. Kawhi.  You don't hear anyone say Michael (Jordan), James (Harden), Kevin (Durant), Anthony (Davis), etc."
"you need to on the LeBron James-tier to have the success he probably wants with the team he's had. You can be a very good, successful player who's proud of your career without being on that level."
I think that has more to do with the uniqueness of their first or last name. Do you know many people named LeBron? Kawhi? Giannis? Then you got James Harden. James is super common. Fred VanVleet. His first name is Fred. If his name was VanVleet Smith people would call him VanVleet.

Jason Terry averaging more points than LeBron James in a finals series is something that should be mentioned
"You do understand that we have lineup data in 2020, right? Here are the team’s stats with LeBron, Davis, and Rondo:  \- LeBron James + Rajon Rondo (w/o Davis): +13.4 in 358 minutes  \- Anthony Davis + Rajon Rondo (w/o LeBron): -4.9 in 357 minutes   Or we can do Kuzma:   \- LeBron James + Kyle Kuzma (w/o Davis): +12.1 in 547 minutes   \- Anthony Davis + Kyle Kuzma (w/o LeBron): -12.0 in 312 minutes   Or we can do Kuzma + Rondo:  \- LeBron James + Kyle Kuzma + Rajon Rondo (w/o Davis): +17.3 in 284 minutes   \- Anthony Davis + Kyle Kuzma + Rajon Rondo (w/o LeBron): -8.3 in 236 minutes   The pattern is the same for a ton of other combos lmao. One of these on their own isn’t indicative of much given the relatively small sample sizes, but a consistent pattern emerges when you analyze a ton of different lineups.   It’s okay to admit that Davis just isn’t an MVP caliber player. LeBron is both a much better player and far more important to the team."
"I think AD is super underrated defensively. He’s made a ton of game winning plays with his defense. I think he’s been overrated offensively at the same time. All-time caliber rim runner and a very good offensive rebounder. But other facets of his game such as midrange shooting and post game are mediocre/below average compared to his peers. He’s simply not a very good passer either. His inability to consistently create his own shot combined with the Lakers lack of a backup ball handler are part of the reason why the Lakers struggle so much without LeBron on the floor. His game is perfect for being the #2 guy to a LeBron James type player. His skill set isn’t set to be able to take control of games offensively and be a #1. He’s been hitting 40% of his 3s since the new year, but his history of being a mediocre shooter for most of his career has teams leaving him wide open still. It’ll be interesting if it will carry over into the playoffs and next season when teams could play him close."
I do not (and I cannot stress this enough) care about LeBron James on a personal level lol. Great player tho.
There’s a MASSIVE drop off between LeBron James and whoever makes plays for the Lakers that day. Rondo isn’t good and he’s injured. Everyone else isn’t even a NBA level playmaker.   The offense goes to shit for a number of other reasons. And being unguardable implies one on one.
"Okay I’ve made some Instagram posts condemning racism and tagging black lives matter. I’ve also told my friends that racism is bad   Now I’m on LeBrons level. Thank you for inspiring me to fight for civil rights. If only I could do it from a mansion in a majority white neighborhood while propagating negative Mexican stereotypes on Tuesday’s, but alas I’m not actually LeBron James."

"Probably gonna get downvoted but I don’t think the criticisms leveled at him were all that unfair bar the 3rd max slot thing. He was always under qualified for the job. He’s done a good job but they also had Lebron sign with them, AD want to be traded to them, and a bunch of talent to trade. They were the worst team in the league for 6 years and had to pivot away from DLo and Randle although that was kind of before his time.  They stayed with Walton but had fired him last year and got their 3rd choice head coach in Vogal. I think they’ve done pretty well on the margins and don’t have any big contracts outside of AD and Lebron. But I don’t think getting the #1 seed with Lebron fucking James is a time for everyone to kiss his feet lol"
"Im not talking very good, obviously you cant get anywhere if you dont have good role players (*Knicks*). Im talking actual Superstars. If it wasnt for Lebron James orchestrating his super teams, Lebron James would be James Harden. Amazing regular season player fun to watch in the playoffs, no rings."

"Just because you get a better player doesn’t make the team better you have to think about fit James Harden is one of the most ball dominant guards in league history and lebron is also incredibly ball dominant, that’s the beauty of AD he doesn’t need to handle the ball to put in work, you can feed him in the post or you can throw him lobs"
Imagine Harden with Lebron James holy moly
"-LeBron James, 2018"
"Talkin' 'bout LeBron ""China"" James?"
"When you give Lebron James shooters it’s never a poor roster construction, but it could’ve been better (Danny Green was an overpay) but that’s because Kawhi fucked them during FA."
[Lebron brought this up himself.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-james-says-paul-pierce-is-his-biggest-rival/)
"Man almost quietly got a triple double.  Just think he is playing lowkey til the playoffs, don't think there is any rust or washed element to it. It's LeBron James at the end of the day."
LeBron James has the perfect teammate in Anthony Davis. They both really feed off each other.
Playoffs mode LeBron James is going to wreck the league.
"&gt;Can't wait till we start rolling out the AD-Bron PnR. We ran it ONCE in the 4th quarter and AD got a free lane to the basket for a big dunk despite the Jazz packing the paint.  &gt; &gt;At the moment there are times when AD and Bron aren't anywhere in the near vicinity of each other during offensive plays so it's safe to assume we're hiding it.  Yup, exactly. People shouldn't be surprised if the Lakers have another gear in the NBA Playoffs where they play Anthony Davis way more at the center position in the later rounds of the playoffs, and way more LeBron James post ups, where he's lethal, whether that's scoring the ball, or passing out of the post for assists lol  If you go back to past Lakers games this regular season, the Lakers would usually go with Anthony Davis at the 5 and be attack aggressively with LeBron and AD pick and rolls with shooters all around during clutch moments lol"
"Yes, because the corpse of Al Horford and a starting PG who was a G League player “screams” super team when compared to:   Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, and Chris Bosh. Alrighty then."
LeBron James with another 2FTA game. TF
LeBron James
"LeBron James has definitely been coasting, you can easily see the effort he's been putting in offensively in the 4th quarter against the Utah Jazz. This reminds me a lot of the start of this regular season lol"
"LeBron ""Klay ""Reggie miller"" Thompson"" James"
"Lakers would have been OP with Lopez and his spacing too.      Avery Bradley, Danny Green, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Brook Lopez."
"&gt;Who is he going to tighten it to  I imagine that Frank Vogel will tighten the playoff rotation to 8-9 players, maybe even 10 players depending on who's playing well, and depending on the matchup. For example, the Lakers will use JaVale McGee and Dwight Howard less while giving Markieff Morris more minutes against smaller teams like the Rockets and Clippers where the Lakers need more floor spacing for LeBron James to drive the ball and run pick and rolls with Anthony Davis as well. That's just 1 example though, it all depends on the matchup in the playoffs lol"
"It's time for LeBron to back it back to 2012 and go receding hairline James, just look at what GS did when they bought back Bogut and Curry with his 2015 shoe"
"I mean not really, he spent the first half of his career on badly run, underperforming Celtics teams where his best teammate was 37 year old Gary Payton while rivals for All NBA merits like Tim Duncan, Chris Webber, Dirk Nowtizki, Stoudemire etc were on winning teams in the west. Even the Timberwolves with KG looked good by comparison. LeBron James was just Lebron James and even when the Celtics were winning he was considered the 3rd wheel to KG and Allen despite being FMVP. And you can’t sit there and tell me Bruce Bowen deserved to be all defensive more than Pierce for whacking anybody who even dared think of attempting a layup. And if Kobe Bryant can get 12 all defensive nods then maybe All NBA voting is a pretty bad measure of a player’s achievements"
"&gt;I feel like LeBron is playing like he is waiting for Ty Lue to walk into the gymnasium and take over on the coaching.  Lol jokes aside, LeBron James was kind of passive offensively at the start of the regular season as well. He wants to get all of his teammates involved first. He ramped up his offensive aggressiveness during the middle of the NBA season, so I expect him to ramp it up during the NBA Playoffs as well lmao 😂😂😂"
So LeBron James just did that nice move and layup lol okay very cool very noice
Imagine getting trained by LeBron James
"Old man list (35+) as of today  35: LaMarcus Aldridge, Jared Dudley, Trevor Ariza, Taj Gibson, Anthony Tolliver, Chris Paul, P.J. Tucker, Joakim Noah, Paul Millsap, Marc Gasol, LeBron James  36: J.J. Barea, JJ Redick, Carmelo Anthony, Thabo Sefolosha, Andre Iguodala  37: Tyson Chandler  39: Kyle Korver  40: Udonis Haslem, Jamal Crawford"
Definitely not Lebron James numbers against you in the post-season.
Believe or not that's lebron james numbers against us... it's a compliment
a disgusting act from lebron james
"tiger woods, lebron james, michael jordan, tj warren wow"
"Haha. If I hadn't included him, I suspected someone would shit on me for not doing it so I got in there early but I agree.   [This] (https://www.gq.com/story/lebron-james-mustache-is-officially-out-of-control) is the LeBron I want to see again."
"Players clearly ahead of him: Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Anthony Davis if he's a forward, Giannis. He has a good chance to get third team. Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Midddleton are his competitors I guess."
"&gt;They might finish 3rd but hope they finish 4th/5th for obvious reasons. They will be tough no matter what.  The Lakers can lock up the 1st seed if they win against the Jazz later this evening or if the Clippers lose to the Suns tomorrow. The Lakers play the Thunder on Wednesday, and the Rockets on Thursday (Idk why the hell the NBA would make that game a back to back, but whatever). I wonder if the Lakers will try to influence seeding going forward if they lock up the 1st seed tonight by losing to the Rockets this Thursday, and then trying and winning versus the Nuggets on August 10th lol  I also want the Lakers to try and avoid as many injuries as possible. That Jonathan Isaac torn left ACL injury spooked me. Maybe play LeBron James and Anthony Davis in the 1st halves for conditioning or something like that after locking up the 1st seed. The NBA wouldn't like it if the Lakers don't try or rest some players against the Houston Rockets this Thursday lol"
"Would you rather have Lebron James with Kawhi's +8 wingspan and massive hands, or Michael Jordan without the gambling problems.   (whole careers)"
"Team LeBron: Dejounte Murray, Collin Sexton, LeBron James, Dario Saric, Wendell Carter Jr.  Best team that LeBron beats: I'd say this team beats the Bucks rights now  Edit: I missread the prompt initially"
"Ben Simmons can guard 1-5, and he's still a guard because he often guards 1s even though he's can guard bigger. Lebron James does not guard guards period which is why he always has 2 defensive guards on the floor with him - Lebron guarded OG, not Lowry. Lebron guarded MM not Reggie Jackson."
What kind of question is this? It’s Lebron James bro.   https://imgur.com/gallery/nG4vRZ9
That Hawks team did get to the Conference Finals though. It's not exactly doing nothing.  They just happened to run into LeBron James.
Yet if it that happened to LeBron James they would probably still suck his dick
Because we have lebron James and I trust him. He has the best b-ball Iq in basketball and he will tear apart that defense in a 7 game series. We also have a top 3 defense
"No LeBron will be 36, and we all know how important age is in MVP conversations.  Also did you know James Harden scored 10 points in the Rockets loss to the Spurs in WCSF in 2017?  James Harden could win DPOY and we’d still get comments about how he’s a terrible defender."
"&gt;Sure, that works in the regular season when teams aren't adjusting their lineups and tactics to match the Lakers. In the playoffs, Rockets would crowd the basket to prevent AD and LeBron from scoring easy buckets and dare their guards to win them the game, which isn't going to happen.  The Houston Rockets love to switch on defense. This is where LeBron James in the post shines. I can just as easily say the Lakers would wear out the Houston Rockets in a 7 game series and physically dominate them inside, but that's not how this works.  &gt;Raptors did some of that yesterday and the results were exactly what I expected. The Rockets may not be as great defensively, but they will utterly punish the Lakers guards on the other end.  Wait... please don't tell me you're coming to a conclusion off of 1 game where everybody is rusty, especially the older Lakers... You should give teams at least 2 weeks or so of regular season games to catch up to speed. The Lakers defense is way ahead of their offense right now. Their offense will catch up eventually. I can easily say the Houston Rockets are pathetic defensively for allowing the Dallas Mavericks 149 points, which should never happen, even with a quarter of overtime, but I won't come to any conclusions about any team during the first week of regular season NBA basketball. Do you remember how LeBron James played at the start of the season compared to the middle of the season? Exactly lol  The matter of the fact is, yes, the Houston Rockets guards will punish the Lakers guards (I mean, the Houston Rockets guards will punish most NBA teams but whatever lol), but the Lakers superstar pairing in LeBron James and Anthony Davis will punish the Houston Rockets lack of size and inside defense as well, which matters in the NBA Playoffs. Defense and rebounding wins championships, after all lol"
"&gt; According to CleaningTheGlass's website, the Lakers with AD at the 4 and LeBron on the court, they're a +7.0 in 1,996 possessions. The Lakers with AD at the 5 and LeBron on the court are an even better +13.5 in 885 possessions. I'm expecting the Lakers to also feature LeBron James in the post a lot more later in the playoffs, where the Lakers have been deadly. As of March 3rd, 2020, the Lakers scored an amazing 1.413 points per possession whenever LeBron James is passing out of the post according to Zach Lowe and Synergy.  Sure, that works in the regular season when teams aren't adjusting their lineups and tactics to match the Lakers.

"&gt;Harden/Westbrook would absolutely abuse those Lakers guards. They'd force the Lakers to go small, which isn't ideal since their biggest strength is front-court.  I'm confused... When the Lakers go ""small"" with Anthony Davis at the center position, they're even better. And we already know that AD will be at the 5 more in the NBA Playoffs, especially considering the matchup versus the Houston Rockets. Why is this a bad thing again lol  According to CleaningTheGlass's website, the Lakers with AD at the 4 and LeBron on the court, they're a +7.0 in 1,996 possessions.

#LEBRON JAMES
YOU’RE DOING IT WRONG IT’S ACTUALLY LEBRON JAMES
LeBron James
Indiana Pacers need to do a rebrand to be able to draw more star free agents like Lebron James and Kawhi Leonard. I suggest they relocate and become the Los Angeles Pacers.  Portland Trailblazers need to do a rebrand to be able to draw more star free agents like Lebron James and Kawhi Leonard. I suggest they relocate and become the Los Angeles Trailblazers.  Washington Wizards need to do a rebrand to be able to draw more star free agents like Lebron James and Kawhi Leonard. I suggest they relocate and become the Los Angeles Wizards.  Orlando Magic need to do a rebrand to be able to draw more star free agents like Lebron James and Kawhi Leonard. I suggest they relocate and become the Los Angeles Magic.  Philadelphia 76ers need to do a rebrand to be able to draw more star free agents like Lebron James and Kawhi Leonard. I suggest they relocate and become the Los Angeles 76ers.  Denver Nuggets need to do a rebrand to be able to draw more star free agents like Lebron James and Kawhi Leonard. I suggest they relocate and become the Los Angeles Nuggets.  ESPN HIRE ME
Lebron James would meet that criteria.
"People can say Harden had a bad game offensively. He didn't make the same amount of shots he usually does, but the impact is everything. I've been trying to tell people, and today was the perfect example of why James Harden is CLEARLY the best player in the world. They shot 60 3s, 60. Not counting Harden's, the rest of them were mostly wide open. And this is the case every night, team's know Harden can score at will so they pack the pain and force him to drive and kick. And live with the idea of Jeff Green, PJ Tucker, Covington making wide open shots. If Harden was in Durant's position in GS, dude would've shot a career high 50% like KD, and if he drove he's getting an assist cause the shots wide open. He's literally the most unguardable player ever, if you don't believe me, just believe the coaches who get paid millions to stop the man. And their strategy is to double him at half court lol. Appreciate him while you can, he's a master of the game who can do whatever he wants. Just go look at his last 4 seasons, and ask yourself, if LeBron averaged these numbers wouldn't he be called the best player in the game? Harden has gotten a relentless amount of hate, just because he dribble dribble dribbles, but what do you want him to do? Pass it to PJ Tucker so he can go get a bucket? Or Daniel House who came from the League. Or the last 2 years, where CP3 gets hurt, and he has to carry the team. The numbers are there, the coaches give him respect by scheming for him the way they do, and trust me no other player has seen the coverages Harden sees on a daily night. If he didn't run into the GS Warriors, 2 years in a row, he would have two rings. And remember, LeBron got swept by the KD Warriors, and lost 4-1. Harden took them to 7 &amp; 6. Yea, he might not be efficient from the field, but with the sorry teammates he has had year after year, he makes it work because he is so good offensively that you have to just give up wide open shots to the role players. WIDE OPEN. But his TS percentage is amongst league best for a reason, because dudes have to foul if he goes the basket. He's too strong, too quick, for most players to check one on one. Go watch the tape from this game, and see how each 3 for Tucker is wide open. Again NBA coaches subliminally indicate he's the best in the game, their scheme says it all. When a guy gets doubled at half court, game after game, and still finds a way to score 40, that should mean something. He's been the best player in the game for the last 4 years and its not close. The NBA is political, and about the cards dealt to you. Harden ever since he got to Houston has made them a winning franchise. LeBron left to get help in Miami, Cleveland and now LA. Harden had a beat up CP3 who either missed half of the regular season every year, got hurt in the playoffs, or averaged 15 ppg against the Warriors last year. This is the first year he's had actual caliber superstar in Westbrook, and they will win bc of it, barring any injuries. The proof is in the pudding, and the whole notion that he's not a good defender is beyond me. LeBron has never been a good on ball defender in his career, off ball yes, but not on ball. And that's not knock on him, when you have to do everything on the offensive end that is going to happen. LeBron had Richard Jefferson guarding KD in the finals, and KD averaged 35 lol, and Jefferson went to commentating the year after. Harden was OKC's second best defender, after Thabo. He gets to Houston, gets put on memes for lackadaisical defense which LeBron has been accounted for on numerous occasions (Kuzma pushing him out to the 3) and Harden becomes a ""bad defender."" He's been a lot better this year though with consistent effort, but has always been a good off ball defender and a great post up defender. If it wasn't for the media, Harden would be appreciated more, but it is what it is. Dude has been the best player for the last 4 years, numbers prove it, team success does, but the media will never. Again he would be a 2x champ if it wasn't for CP3 getting hurt the first time, not showing up last year, and the refs fucking them over in both series. Go watch the tape, NBA coaches and players know he's unguardable but the media has y'all fooled. S/O to one of the best to ever do it in James Harden."
"Seeing as the Raptors only ever lose playoff matchups to teams that have LeBron James, this is great news!"
"Dan Devine of The Ringer published an article with his picks for the All-NBA, All-Defensive and All-Rookie teams today, and I have some complaints:  * Anthony Davis is a centre on his All-NBA ballot and a forward on his All-Defensive ballot * Jimmy Butler is a forward on his All-NBA ballot and a guard on his All-Defensive ballot * Apparently Jayson Tatum and LeBron James are guards * Apparently Luka Doncic is a forward"
It's like if lebron james had no finesse and thought they were playing rugby
"Mine are just based on how fun I think they would be to watch.  East  Celtics - Sixers   * Old rivalry, Smart/Embiid beef, Tatum yamming on Horford again for leaving Boston, in general these games are always super high intensity and fun to watch.   Bucks - Raptors  * If there is an underdog team that can beat the bucks i think it's the Raps or Celtics. I don't enjoy watching the Celtics Bucks games, but the Raps Bucks games are always very high intensity.  Heat - Pacers   * No comment, just a good match-up.   Magic - Nets  West  Rockets - Thunder  * CP3 and his surprisingly good squad shock everyone by beating Harden and the Rockets in 7 games, just because.  Mavs - Lakers  * Luka v. James, KP v. AD, Dwight v. Dwight, enough said.   Blazers - Clippers  Nuggets - Jazz   * 2 of the top big men.   Championship  Celtics - Lakers or Celtics - Clippers  * Lakers: Another old rivalry, 2 teams built very differently, I love the idea of beating LeBron after he dominated the East for so long. * Clippers: The best wing duo from the East vs. the best wing duo from the West, Tatum - Brown are the next PG - Kawhi, insane regular season games, Smart - Beverly beef."
This is the right choice. But then again im ive been a Luka stan for some time now so take that with a grain of salt. James Harden is a ridiculously good 2 guard and is virtually unmatched in his scoring prowess. It just goes to show how crowded the top of the nba is becoming these days. I imagine that LeBron is the other guard being chosen???
"I mean I think we are just in a weird transitional period for basketball due to the rule construction and drafting process that has changed the way the game is played.  Ben Taylor, of Thinking Basketball fame, has [this video](https://youtu.be/r0934lGZ4dw) that details a new team-building philosophy that has begun to litter the NBA.   The basic gist of the video is that the NBA has changed from a game that built a team that utilized the traditional roles of PG, SG, SF, PF, and C with a usual focus built around your center to a league where one player regardless of position dominates the ball and surrounding that player with shooters (once again regardless of positions).  You look at teams like the Lakers, Bucks, Mavs, Rockets, they all have the exact same roster construction. One superstar that has the ball in their hands at an insane rate that scores a ton by driving to the paint. If they don't drive to the paint, the usually kick out for a slick assist. Rinse and repeat ad nauseaum.  It doesnt matter that James Harden and Giannis are very, very different players with very different skills. They play almost the exact same game. They have the ball a ton in their hands as they try to drive to the rim endlessly. They then kick out if they can't hit the floater/dunk/lay-up.  Same could be said of Luka or Lebron. Yes each of those teams have their own quirks. Lakers have AD. ROckets have Westbrook. But they all still function very similarly.  But institutions move slowly. SO even though these changes are happening before our eyes, the institution of the NBA and media aren't quick enough to pick up on it. We still award all-nba based off position and the such.  I just think in the future we will think about positions differently. Basketball isn't like football or soccer or baseball where the different positions actually have different jobs and concerns. In basketball, every person wants to score, everyone wants to assist, everyone wants to rebound and everyone wants to defend. Positions were created to make roster construction easy, but it is a relic of the past and should be thrown out as soon as possible to me."
Absurd take seeing how Kyrie's only playoff success has come behind LeBron freaking James.
"Seeing as Frank Vogel said this year that Lebron James would be playing tons of minutes at Point Guard, I think arguing Lebron is a PG is a pretty good point.  And who cares what you are listed as. If it plays like a point guard, passes like a point guard, handles the ball like a point guard, why does it matter if they are listed as a shooting guard?"
"He has carried the raptors so many times tho, you just don't hear about it because the choker narrative has become a popular meme. No way would I take kyrie over him, even with kawhi on the team he was the vocal leader and a leader on the court of a team that won a championship, he can glue things together, do the small things and even if it might not fully show up on the stat line, it sure does show up in his advanced statistics and coach's praise. He attempted to take a charge on lebron James yesterday while he was coming into the paint like a freight train, effort and intensity."
"He's still only 21 and learning the NBA. It shows how good he really is if a guy who's only in his second NBA season is being criticized this much for his mainly learning mistakes. There are few guys who already in their second season mastered how to play in the clutch, and control their shot selection.  Yes, you can point to some legends, but most of them were older than Luka. Carlise is letting Luka develop, because most fans and even Mavs management didn't expect that they would be back in the playoffs already in their second season with Luka. You rather see Luka make mistakes now than when you really have a chance of winning, and going further in the playoffs.  I still remember when LeBron James himself was criticized for his poor clutch play early in his career. I would be concerned with Luka if the same mistakes and shot selection continued in his 4th year, because most elite guys figure themselves and their mistakes by the end of their rookie contract (end of their 4th year)."
"if you play with 2 players smaller than you at all times and never guard point guards you arent a point guard.  The role he might play from the position of small forward might be different, sure, but position doesnt dictate role. Derrick FIsher was a PG to Kobe's 2g even though Kobe was the main ball handler a lot of the time. Same thing with wade and Lebron in Miami, theyu always played with a smaller PG that guarded guards even though they didnt initiate offense. there are 5 million examples of this and theres no reason to call players that play and guard one position another position, just because taller players are initiating more offense league wide.  Giannis isnt a PG either. Kawhi isnt a PG. James Harden isnt a PG. Its really not hard. IDK why people are making it out to be"
"That's not that uncommon at the #1 spot. I think an analysis of #1 picks shows that they rarely ever help the team that drafted them to become significantly better. Of course there are some that do, but for every Hakeem Olujawan or Lebron James, there's like 10 Michael Olowokandis."
"Remember when the KG Pierce Brooklyn Nets sweeped the reg season against Lebrons heat, only to get swept back in the playoffs?  Yeah I wouldn’t put much stock in regular season games against LeBron James"
You don’t watch enough LeBron James. If the dude played with legit jump shooter he would average 15 assists a game.

Lol nah  If defense was all that mattered there are plenty of non shooters in the g league who could probably make an all defense team one day. Hell if they wanted to they could’ve packaged THT+ a 2nd rounder for Josh Jackson or Kris Dunn. This is a Lebron James team of course they are paying Green to shoot well.

"Yes dumbass, I am LeBron James, telling you and everybody else to wear a mask! (Without a hole in it) #justakidfromakron #washedking #thirdhashtag"
"Underrated: James Harden. People keep saying he isn´t a Top 5 player which is absolutely ridiculous. In the last 4 regular season he was a Top 3 player and his playoff performances got a lot better in recent years.  Overrated: Anthony Davis. I just don´t know how he is a Top 5 player. Without a guard who can facilitate and pass well he doesn´t do anything special. The year he made the Playoffs with NOP he had Rondo and Holiday who could do that, now he has LeBron. The Lakers would be around 7-10 without Bron this season."
I don’t. I also don’t miss Cleveland LeBronto.  I like LeBron James as a player and a person but as a Raptors fan it’s been rough sharing a Conference with that guy.
Lebron James.
"In April of 2018, LeBron was a career 41-10 against the Raptors in the regular season.  I'm not sure your statement is very true.  https://www.landofbasketball.com/head_to_head_gl/cavaliers_vs_raptors_game_log_season.htm  https://www.si.com/nba/2018/04/30/lebron-james-career-stats-record-vs-toronto-raptors"
LeBron owned Casey. James has a high BBIQ and Casey was predicable af
"I don't want to be rude or anything, but I don't think a Timberwolves fan has the right to say anything about anyone owning anyone. Getting ""owned"" by someone who is in the GOAT conversation shouldn't even be a diss. It's not like we got ""owned"" by some scrub, that's LeBron Fucking James. I would take getting pimp slapped by LeBron over not making the playoffs to even get the opportunity to get beaten by LeBron."
"**Kyle Lowry**: 33 points, 14 rebounds, 6 assists,   **LeBron James/Anthony Davis**: 34 points, 16 rebounds, 8 assists,"
Right lol it’s fucking Lebron James one of the best passers of all time and Anthony Davis one of the best lob catchers of all time. Wtf are they doing lol
"**KYLE LOWRY IS BETTER THAN LEBRON JAMES, THERE I SAID IT**"
"When playing against LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard, the best rebounder on the court today was the 6'1 point guard Kyle Lowry."
Toronto has Emancipated from Lebron James.
It's how LeBron James approaches game in particular.
"Lebron James had the n word spray painted on his house in Los Angeles in 2017. The LAPD has one of the worst reputations for racism out of all police forces in the country. We can on and on about what city is racist, but its stupid between LA and Boston because both have a bad history with race."
and guess who was petitioning for that? lebron the queen james. he bitched out to get draymond suspended. not a real competitor.
Butler is being guarded by AD and LeBron James lol
Did the league review that one play when crowder put lebron James in an arm bar after diving for the bl?!? In game one I think
"Heat was mad stacked, at the SG they had Dwayne, C Bosh and SF James, the other 11 players, well i would love for you to tell me, because i really cant remember who their starting PG that season was or who was on the bench. But i can name the entier starting lineup of the Warriors that broke the game wins record, had a unanimous MVP, two of the greatest shooters in NBA history in their prime, a DPOY and Iggy still in his prime. Yea, Lebron tottaly did the same...."
Facts   I'm surprised the Bay Area fans didn't lobby to get Kerr arrested after having Ezeli out there on an island multiple possessions on LeBron Raymone James in Game 7 of the fucking FINALS
"I will try one or two for every team. Some of these are far-fetched and depend either on title or spending most of their careers with one team. I couldn't find one for Indy no matter how much I dug.  Atlanta Hawks - Trae Young, Joe Johnson?  Boston Celtics - Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen  Brooklyn Nets - Kevin Durant  Charlotte Hornets - Kemba Walker?  Chicago Bulls - Derrick Rose  Cleveland Cavaliers - LeBron James  Dallas Mavericks - Luka Doncic, JJ Barea?  Denver Nuggets - Nikola Jokic, Carmelo Anthony?  Detroit Pistons - Grant Hill?  Golden State Warriors - Steph, Klay, Dray  Houston Rockets - James Harden, Tracy Mcgrady?  Indiana Pacers -   Los Angeles Clippers - Chris Paul, Blake Griffin  Los Angeles Lakers - Anthony Davis  Memphis Grizzlies - Mike Conley, Marc Gasol  Miami Heat - LeBron James, Udonis Haslem?  Milwaukee Bucks - Giannis  Minnesota Timberwolves - KAT, Kevin Garnett?  New Orleans Pelicans - Zion  New York Knicks - Carmelo Anthony?  Oklahoma City Thunder - Russell Westbrook  Orlando Magic - Dwight Howard  Philadelphia 76ers - Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons  Phoenix Suns - Devin Booker  Portland Trail Blazers - Dame Lillard  Sacramento Kings - Mike Bibby?  San Antonio Spurs - Tony Parker  Toronto Raptors - Kyle Lowry, Vince Carter  Utah Jazz - Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell  Washington Wizards - Bradley Beal"
Imagine pretending that the 47-35 Heat team had *any* relation to that team with CHRIS BOSH AND LEBRON JAMES ADDED TO IT.
"Have you watched this man play? He doesn't just chuck up shots or drive to the basket nonstop. He looks for the right play and plays around his teammates. He's always looking for the best shot, whether its for him or his teammates. He earns the calls he gets. You have fucking lebron james and anthony davis. I dont want to hear you bitch about free throws."
"the lakers have lebron james and ad, both better than anyone on the heat. star power matters. and the dude is right. dude had another outstanding finals performance, but he looked absolutely gassed at the end. I’d give the lakers game 6."
"Because lebron is actually one of the superstars that doesnt get superstar treatment. If that were james harden, you know hes getting the call. Bron gets pulled and powers through reach in and gets fuckall for most of the game"
"His FT rate is literally the highest ever so unless he's fouled more than prime shaq (who people fouled on purpose) you'd think at least some calls are going his way.  He does get fouled a lot, but he also gets the benefit of the doubt a lot. I don't think it's rigged by any means, some players are just better at selling contact than others. Jimmy butler and James harden are those players.  Also I admit LeBron probably complains the most out of any player, and it is pretty annoying."
"I love LeBron James, go Lakers!"
"You’re not wrong about that.  Quoting LeBron:  “I wear the number 23 because of Mike,” James said. “I think I fell in love with the game because of Mike. When you’re growing up and you’re seeing Michael Jordan, it’s almost like a god.”  https://us.blastingnews.com/sports/2017/05/lebron-james-reveals-why-he-chose-the-number-23-001729173.html"
"A lot of soft fouls seemed to go Miami's way with the Lakers really barely getting any calls go their way. It was more prominent in the first half of the game with things getting marginally better in the second half. If LeBron got the kind of calls Butler was getting yesterday throughout the game we win the game; that charging foul with Duncan Robinson was pretty bad too and the fact the refs stuck with the call basically sums up the refs' performance last night.  That doesn't excuse the atrocious defense the Lakers displayed late into the fourth, especially Morris, but the refereeing didn't help either.  Also, just looking at FT numbers isn't an honest description of whether or not the referees were fair. I'm pretty sure LeBron only had 2 or three free throws going into the fourth quarter. LeBron James of all people. The person whose game is predicated on attacking the basket and the focus of an offense that was attack Duncan Robinson.   I know talking about the refs usually ends up with people calling the fans petty and salty, but the referees were pretty bad last night and /r/nba refuses to talk about it because Jimmy Butler is the hot commodity and because /r/nba won't acknowledges that when it hurts the Lakers."
Is LeBron James on the team?  Theres your answer
"Did I ever say I'm some super tough macho man? Are you even watching the games? He falls over if someone breathes on him to get foul calls it's fucking ridiculous. You're legit defending his toughness by saying he's an elite athlete. Are these two things even correlated? If you're elite at a sport, you're tough as nails? We're not gonna act like lebron james who's much better than AD wasn't considered a flop queen for most of his career?"
I'm just glad Crowder wasn't complaining cause he's been roughing up Lebron James the entire series.
"What, you think Jimmy's supposed to stop LeBron James or something? LMAO"
"Yes, the call on the floor was a technical, I was referring to the discussions the league was reportedly having after the game as to whether to upgrade it to a flagrant 1 or 2 (they went with the former, and James also received a technical).   But he was suspended because that made four flagrants for Green in the playoffs, not because Lebron asked the league to suspend him. There's a difference between the two.  If Jimmy 'does what Lebron did torward Green ', Davis would just end up with a flagrant on his record, not be suspended."
"I respect him for his drive and his defense, but his offensive game is James Harden without the skills. He’s shot almost as many free throws as LeBron and AD combined this series. Officiating last night was especially bad."
Danny Green is an elite shooter.  LeBron James is one of the best to ever lace them up.   Miami has been playing LeBron straight up for the whole series. This is the genius of Spo'. He waited until he needed to win to pull out the swarm LeBron defense. It threw LeBron off balance so he made a bad pass.  It surprised Danny Green too.  Playing with expectations is what elite teams do.  Spo created an expectation of how the heat would defend and then took it away at the pinnacle of the game.  Spo was such a magician that you didn't even see the trick.   Your hot take isn't even luke warm.  Delete this.
"&gt; if LeBron had a reliable post game  [Just FYI:](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2878938-which-stars-can-be-trusted-with-post-ups-in-todays-nba.amp.html)  &gt; LeBron James has posted up more this season (13.6 percent of his possessions) than he did all of last season (8.2 percent). James doesn't just score out of the post; he also forces opponents to send double-teams, creating scoring opportunities. The Los Angeles Lakers are shooting 58.9 percent off James' passes out of the post, which is the highest out of any player with at least 100 post-up possessions. James' 1.16 PPP out of the post (including passes) has been one of Lakers' best weapons in [clutch situations](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2878198-los-angeles-lakers-versatility-driving-crunch-time-success). "
&gt; What fucking team could KD have joined that could pay him AND be good enough to beat that Lebron/Kyrie Cavs team?   You mean besides the Thunder who had just gone up 3-1 on said team? And the  Rockets. And the Blazers? And the Celtics?  Kawhi and PG are douche hats. But they’re two all stars on an otherwise lottery team.   AD joined a 38 years old Lebron James on a team of bench players and veterans.   You really don’t get it? Really?   FOUR ALL STARS ON ONE TEAM.   73-9.   73-9.   73-9.
"i disagree. if the Lakers win the finals, then players like LeBron James, Anthony Davis and the others won the bubble"
Tiger Woods. LeBron James. Michael Jordan. Jimmy Butler. Wow.
Really?   You don’t see a difference between the second best player in the league joining the team that just went 73-10 breaking the NBA all time record of games won in a season. With 3 all stars. Who had just won an NBA championship. Arguably the best team of all time. And leaving the team that barely lost to them.   And Anthony Davis who was dragging a team to the 8 seed every year kicking and screaming to join a 38 year old Lebron James and a lottery team of bench players and veterans and taking them to the finals?   Really?   Really.
The Miami Heat added two all stars to a lottery team to take on the three all stars on the Celtics.   Durant left 2 all stars to join a team with 3 all stars who had won a championship and who just broke the record of most NBA games won in a season he couldn’t beat so he could get some cheap ass rings.  It would be like if Lebron James had joined the Celtics because he couldn’t beat them.
9 out of the last 10 finals have had at least of Lebron james or the new york knicks
Lebron James is a SELLOUT
"Lebron aint gonna let it happen, but the Heat winning would probably be the GOAT comeback in sports. 5th seed with their starting PG out and their best big missing two games vs the 1st seed in the west with two top 5 players, one of them being Lebron fucking James. Also in our series Bogut was also out the last two games, so we didn't have our full starters any time after game 4."
10 of the last 10 finals involved either Kyle Lowry or LeBron James
LeBron James has personally never defecated nor emptied his bowels on my person. I have never even met the man.
"Also, yeah he definitely has 1p times the resume, tip LeBron James has 50 all star appearances and 30 all nab appearances   Fool"
I just wish LeBron “I took it personally” James will hear this.
Honestly watch the last linked one over again it looks like he's just moving him out of the way before LeBron James runs him over. similar to when you're in a car and a parent puts their hand over the child's chest as we come to a quick stop.
"Literally what happens when you get multiple max contact stars..... when the Heat lost w the big 3 there, same shit, it's all on Lebron. Its the price of signing Lebron James, guaranteed Finals run but the teams gonna be very top heavy."
Fixed formatting.  &gt;The list     &gt;1. Jimmy Butler 2020 30.7    2. Shaquille O’Neal 2000 30.6    3. Kevin Durant 2017 30.3    4. Shaquille O’Neal 2002 30.1    5. Lebron James 2017 29.6    6. Micheal Jordan 1993 29.6    7. Micheal Jordan 1991 29.4    8. Lebron James 2018 28.3
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but most of the time when you have Lebron James on your and there's a crunch time moment at the end of the game you just give the ball to Lebron and he does his thing while everyone else just tries to stay out of the way and get open for 3."
"You absolutely do. [LeBron had the entire defense on him.](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/RaggedBoilingAmurminnow-size_restricted.gif) There was no way he's getting a good look and the right move is the pass to one of the best shooters in the league.    In either case, I don't see why we're talking about this when the wrong play was [Markieff Morris trying to make a pass inside to a covered and hobbled Anthony Davis instead of a wide-open LeBron motherfucking James.](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/igy2k16-WMKFSsdJpBTeYueURKE=/1400x0/filters:no_upscale(/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21950595/slack_imgs.png)"
It looks like he was trying to keep Jae Crowder from the path of LeBron James and accidentally hit him in the face.
"Ok ...I’ll be clearer....what I would have wanted him to do is take the screen from Green so that he can drive to his preferred side.  The screen that jimmy doesn’t see coming because he’s playing James left heavy.   I want him to then go down hill against a weak defender in Duncan Robinson and get to the middle...which would force either iggy (who would have to now leave the cornerman or confront lebron) or adebayo ( who would have to leave AD to confront).....or nobody leaves their man and he can get to the basket himself..  What he should not do is drive right where he is clearly double teamed before crossing the three point line, in the direction of Morris who’s man will definitely help which will gain him a 3rd defender...try to go up for the shot ...realize he can’t...and kick out to Danny Green....  It was the wrong play ..."
I don’t understand what part of what I said was toxic. There’s nothing toxic about having a negative opinion of LeBron James.
Jimmy Butler is LeBron James without the ego.
Now imagine it was LeBron James on the receiving end of that
"&gt;Draymond shouldn't have gottena flagrant 1. Lebron purposely stepped over him and Draymond was just flailing in anger to stand up and shove him  Why do people still think that intent still matters. If you inadvertently hit someone in while they attempt a jump shot it doesn't matter if you intended to hit them it's still a foul. It's the same thing with flagrant fouls. A hit to the groin is almost always going to get looked at through the lens of flagrant. Also, LeBron got a technical for stepping over in the first place.  Green was suspended for amassing 4 flagrant fouls in the postseason, not because that nut shot on LeBron was particularly egregious.   &gt;Lebron never even reacted until Windhorst showed him the angle of the tape.  The bumping and jawing James and Green do after the fact imply otherwise."
Lebron James was wide open
I think that jimmy butler played a phenomenal game that cemented his status as a legitimate superstar and a top player in this league. I think a lot of lakers players without finals experience had a rough time in a closeout game.  But I also think that building a 3-1 lead with LeBron James on your team is pretty good insurance against a game like this.  On to game 6 :)
"I agree with the last paragraph. Also, it’s true that not passing to a wide open “shooter” goes against conventional basketball wisdom. However, it was Danny Green out of all his teammates and DG’s body language after the timeout already shows he doesn’t want to take a deciding shot. The Heat cheated off of him for a reason.   It also shows BBIQ to recognize who will be dependable in a situation like that. That’s why when DG gave LeBron the screen at the top of the key, he should have gone over the screen so that he will be switched to Robinson for the drive instead of not using the screen and remaining at Butler’s side and also drawing Robinson as well with him. In fact that path over the screen with Robinson would have opened up KCP at the Corner instead since Iggy will help Robinson once he drives. He could have also used that baby step three or backdown then jumper on Robinson with plenty of time remaining. That was overall a bad decision to drive at Jimmy’s side. Even LeBron said he could have done something better on the last play. He said it himself, ‘Jimmy Butler made one more play than me’.   [LeBron’s statement](https://thesportsrush.com/nba-news-jimmy-butler-made-one-more-play-than-me-lakers-lebron-james-reveals-how-heat-star-outplayed-him-in-nba-finals-game-5/)"
The Cavs actually asked for a two game suspension on Draymond. One game was the compromise. Negotiating 101 taught by LeBron James.
"Yeah. Unfortunately for us Lakers fans, he did. He got a 35 pts triple double and the W. LeBron had a great game with a 40 pts double double but an L. As LeBron said, “Jimmy Butler made one more play than me”.  [LeBron’s statement ](https://thesportsrush.com/nba-news-jimmy-butler-made-one-more-play-than-me-lakers-lebron-james-reveals-how-heat-star-outplayed-him-in-nba-finals-game-5/)"
"He outplayed Giannis for sure, but Jimmy has the luxury of having 10000% less defensive attention than Giannis. I don’t really see a case as to how he’s better than Giannis. A lot of the playoffs is about matchups, Giannis has flaws in his game and he’s dropped in the rankings for sure, but he was also guarded by the entire Heat defense (with Bam/Crowder getting most looks), while Budenholzer had Khris Middleton on Jimmy to close the games out. Series are much more than just 1v1 matchups.   You can use results arbitrarily, but it really means nothing if you strip context. He’s also certainly not better than AD, although he’s had a better series than him on the offensive side. AD has had a more impressive overall postseason run though, if you ask me. The man does everything on the court every second. AD isn’t a primary ball-handler, so him being a 1b doesn’t really mean anything and isn’t really a knock on him as a big. Nor is being a 1b to Lebron James.   I think 8-10 range is fair, behind guys like Lebron, KD, Steph, Kawhi, Harden, AD, and maybe Jokic. He’s somewhere in the Dame or Luka (he’s definitely better than Luka though, IMO. Experience matters) range, which is honestly really fucking phenomenal and isn’t a slight on Jimmy at all. Saying someone isn’t top 3-6 isn’t an insult, again he’s a great player and I’m glad he’s proving it for everyone to see. Let’s just not be reactionary."
"Meanwhile Bron scored five more points but because Green missed the wide open three, everyone is so stoked about Butler. Don't get me wrong, both teams put on a hell of a game, but LeBron James outscored Butler and nobody's kissing his ass right now."
"Kyrie: ""Lebron James is not my daddy!"""
"I think it depends on what area of the world you're talking about. Europe or Asia, it may be pretty big in terms of American sports. But I took my Brazilian friend to a Lakers game last year and he'd never even heard of LeBron James"
Lebron James in close out games:  Thank you refs.
"&gt; To be fair, at least LeBron James pays damn taxes...  Not to defend Trump for literally anything, but there's no law against using tax loopholes. We should all be doing it as much as we can because taxes are bullshit when 80% of them are being used for the fucking military industrial complex."
He was absolutely looking to get bailed out... please answer this...if u were Lebron James and u were as hot as he was last night... with 12 seconds left in the game and the ball in your hands down 1...would u call Danny green over for a screen OR wave off everyone and hold the ball for the last shot???  He was not quadruple teamed he dribbled his way into that trap by calling that screen bro...it’s not like he had the ball and everyone swarmed HE CALLED DANNY GREEN OVER FOR A SCREEN AND HE TRAPPED HIMSELF PLEASE WATCH THE GAME AGAIN AND TELL ME OTHERWISE
"Jimmy is what people thought Kawhi would be. Play as elite 2 way guarding the best player on the floor and getting buckets on the other end. But Butler went beyond that by playing fucking 47 mins and even elevating his teams play through his playmaking. Never thought Jimmy Butler would turn up this much in the playoffs.   If Heat take this to 7 games, win or lose this Heat team and Butler will be fucking GOATed. Imagine an undermanned team taking a LeBron James/AD team to 7 games."
"Yes, of course, lebron James just cant catch a break. Up 3-2 in the finals for the 4th title of his glittering, nearly injury free career. He just cant get a single break his way!"
Jimmy held the Lakers to 1-for-5 shooting as a primary defender down the stretch: 1-for-4 by LeBron James and 0-for-1 by Anthony Davis. He did so while scoring more (11pts) than the entire Lakers cast during crunch time.
Skip: that’s LeBron’s fault. He should have caught that pass from Morris. He’s LeBron James.
"lol im not taking these reply seriously, this is rnba. likpe they gave 2-3 examples of 25+ years of basketball. like that proves something.   i just want him to finish the game with an iconic shot and stop relying on others for big shots. and have the balls to deal with possible critizism if he misses. he just cares way too much what other think of him.  you are lebron james the best player, go for the winning shot, dont pass the ball like some bellow average point guard."
"Can’t really compare everything that LeBron does to Shaq feasting on palookas. He was incredibly dominant, but we’re talking about Rik Smits in his final season, a mid-30s Mutombo, and a prime Todd MacCulloch who would be out of the league in a year. James went up against an all-time great dynasty with an all-time great defense (for this era)."
"Us cleveland fans know this concept a little too well. I'm so used to James playing like he was last night and no one else showing up. I mean, AD showed up, but he kinda got hurt in the first half, which in itself is also a LeBron type curse with how 2015 and Wade's knees."
Jimmy Butler is my father but LeBron James is Daddy
LeBron James. He put up absolutely absurd numbers against three consecutive all-time great teams. The Lakers faced some of the weakest Finals teams in recent memory.
"The best part is Lebron admitted it was a bad pass in an interview. ""I know he wishes he could have it again. I wish I could make a better pass. But you just live with it,"" James said."
"Actual quote from Lebron after the game. ""I know he wishes he could have it again. I wish I could make a better pass. But you just live with it,"" James said."
LeBron James: “I build super teams for moments like these!”
"Agree. With 8 seconds left, down 1 point, LeBron James stands at the baseline waving his hands up and down, not moving to the ball, lookin helpless."
"respect to miami, but idc who it is, if lebron james gets a 3-1 lead he’s finishing the job."
"This post reminds me of that fan q and a episode of Open Court when someone asked would LeBron be a superstar player in the 80s and Steve Kerr just started laughing and said ""He's LeBron James"""
"That’s rude. Just because I refuse to rank Frank “never made the playoffs” above Jimmy “dragged KATs lazy ass to the playoffs and was in 7 of the last 8 playoffs”. The magic qualified for the playoffs 7 games below 500 this year. And Frank, who you want to rank on the level of Lebron James, Dame, and Jimmy, couldn’t make the playoffs?"
LeBron James has been robbed several FMVPs if a player from the loser team gets one.
 Jimmy held the Lakers to 1-for-5 shooting as a primary defender down the stretch: 1-for-4 by LeBron James and 0-for-1 by Anthony Davis. He did so while scoring more than the entire Lakers cast during crunch time.
"He’s averaging 29/9/10 on 56% shooting and absolutely fucking going toe to toe with Lebron James, absolutely wild."
"Don't retract it, he is doing a better job. Jimmy held the Lakers to 1-for-5 shooting as a primary defender down the stretch: 1-for-4 by LeBron James and 0-for-1 by Anthony Davis. He did so while scoring more than the entire Lakers cast during crunch time."
"Don't retract it, he is doing a better job. Jimmy held the Lakers to 1-for-5 shooting as a primary defender down the stretch: 1-for-4 by LeBron James and 0-for-1 by Anthony Davis. He did so while scoring more than the entire Lakers cast during crunch time."
What if their ranking is  1) Wilt Chamberlain  2) Michael Jordan  3) Lebron James

"Serious question, because the story died relatively quickly and I never heard a follow up - were the forced sterilizations proven or was there one accusation and people ran with it?   I don’t think Trump is what most people would call a good or moral human being. I don’t think any of our Presidents in the last 80 years or so have been, except Jimmy Carter.   I also think LeBron speaks without knowledge and understanding of situations, supports (either directly or indirectly) China and their laundry list of horrible human rights abuses, and uses hyperbolic language to further racial division in the country even if its unintentional.   I also think (as an independent) Trump has been, overall, a positively effective POTUS and I think LeBron James is the greatest basketball player of all time."
Stephen Curry and Lebron James.
"I hope you guys are ready for skip to go on undisputed and say “LeBron James had let down the late great Kobe Bean Bryan by not finishing off the job tonight in the mamba jerseys this has to hard his legacy, Kobe would have hit the game winner he wouldn’t have passed it to Danny green.”"
LeBron James isn't perfect. Neither was MJ.
"Hell, even when it came to Williams he picked them because of their supposedly good academic reputation as well. He knew that getting through the eye of the needle was a long shot, and he made smart decisions about his education to have something to fall back on. Safe to say he didn't expect to be bombing threes against LeBron James a few years later lmao"
"Also it’s Jimmy Butler and LeBron James. That’s why I’m saying it’s the most impressive when you look at it all on paper.  Top 15 player, 3 rookies, and serviceable starter Jae Crowder.   Are any of those Heat players in the top 100? Serious question?   Are Tyler Herro, Jae Crowder, Duncan Robinson or Kendrick Nunn top 100 players?   The Lakers have 2 top 5 players and according to SI, have 2 more top 100 players in Danny Green and Kyle Kuzma.   According to SI, the Heat’s only other top 100 players in that game were Andre Iguodala."
"Friends, in no world do you allow lebron james to get AD, Kawhi, Harden and Damian Lillard on the same team. Fk his synergy nonsense."
"Bruh, if i sitting on my couch and JVG on the broadcast knew that they would double LeBron on the PnR and leave the guy that Duncan Robinson was guarding wide open, don't you think that Vogel, Spo and LeBron knew that?  It was going to be either KCP or Green and the Heat absolutely knew it, they'd rather take their chances with a roleplayer shooting a wide open shot than LeBron James playing 1 on 1 against Duncan Robinson. The saying is always the same, make someone else beat you, if Danny Green hits that 3, you shake their hands and congratulate them in their victory, you just can't let LeBron James have an iso for a win."
DRUG TEST JIMMY G BUTLER !!!.   Like fuck nothing seems to faze the dude.   47 minutes ✅ Defend LeBron James ✅ 30 point triple-double ✅ Take the fuck over in the 4th ✅ 100% free throw percentage ✅ Carry the Miami Heat in an elimination game ✅  One does not simply lay dick on the opposition the way Buckets did. Somethins in the coffee ♨️
It’s not easy when you’re the other superstar with LeBron James. He gets all the praises in a win and you get all the blame in a loss
"LeBron James with one of the best games I've ever seen. However, his team really shit the bed here. One of the poorest performances I've seen out of this team all season."
Meaning they drafted well. LeBron spent a lot of time on that first Cavs team. Can you find even one player that had half the caliber to play and support James?
Lebron James when posting up
"I’m going to try and engage even though I’ll probably get downvoted to hell.  It’s not just the fact that you’re about to win. It’s the fact that no other organization can realistically compete with all the advantages you guys have. You’re organization was very poorly run, your GM quit on camera, but LeBron James and Anthony Davis still want to play there.  Charlotte has been a dumpster fire for years and had absolutely zero chance of getting LBJ. No other team can realistically compete and it leaves the fans miserable every single year. We have a hatred for the large markets that grows EVERY SINGLE YEAR, because we know that even if we do everything right, we’ll never be able to have that sort of advantage.  Not trying to argue, just trying to explain the frustration that you’re seeing around this sub."
No you missed my point. Yes Marion and the mavs defense was excellent but this is LeBron James. He did it to himself more than anything
"You don't even need Lebron James.  Steve Kerr never averaged 9ppg in a season, but when the time came he hit the shot the Bulls needed.  Green and Morris just kind of shit the bed in the same situation."
"Agreed. It’s totally inexplicable. He is playing like.. you know, LeBron. He’s actually outdueling LeBron freaking James in NBA Finals games. Without shooting 3s. Handling the ball at all times. Defending LeBron and AD. Playing close to 48 minutes. One of the craziest performances ever so far."
I think going to LeBron fucking James would have been the best option
"""But I’ve never, ever seen a superstar player who gets so much hate or such little love by the cities he’s played for as Lebron James does."" OP with a Skip Bayless-level bearing of reality..."
"**Perspective from a pure business &amp; box office value standpoint:**  1. **LeBron James** - Dude is still the biggest draw in the NBA, he sells the most jerseys/merch and brings in new audiences into your organization. Even if he's aging, he'll still bring in loads of money and championships with the 3-4 potential years you have left with him, and that can arguably be way more valuable financially than a 20 year old up-and-comer. 2. **Giannis Antetokounmpo** - The best of all worlds - b2b MVP, explosive box office talent, and also a superstar for championships for many years to come. If LeBron only had perhaps only 2 seasons left to play, then I would switch LeBron &amp; Giannis. 3. **Luka Doncic** - Highest youth/potential attributes. Can't pass up Luka over anyone under him due to the possibilities the future holds for his career. 4. **Anthony Davis** - Isn't top 3 only due to his injury history. Other than that, a no-brainer. 5. **Jayson Tatum** - Just like Luka, youth/potential but with less draw. 6. **Steph Curry** - Still a big draw, and he's definitely on the older side of 30.. however, his game remains age-friendly as a lot of his prowess comes from his shot making capability. 7. **James Harden** - I can see him doing his thing for another 3 years before falling off, but he just brings so much value overall that he has to be on this list somewhere. 8. **Zion Williamson** - It's Zion. Even if he doesn't live up to the hype, the dude is looked at as pure entertainment.  9. **Kawhi Leonard** - A powerhouse talent with a good amount of years left in him. 10. **Nikola Jokic** - Much like Kawhi, he isn't the biggest draw but he's got everything else. Youth, potential, talent and a fairly good track record towards win value.  **Honorable mentions:** *Joel Embiid, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Ja Morant, Russell Westbrook, Trae Young, Ben Simmons*  **Perspective from a pure basketball talent value contributing towards the best chance for winning championships:**  1. **LeBron James** - Still LeBron at #1. Some of the players listed below him might not even sniff the Finals (again, or ever), while LeBron even with only 3-4 years left to play could have the most potential to get another chip. 2. **Kawhi Leonard** - Yes he choked hard this year, but it's not like Kawhi suddenly lost his track record of winning. I would still take him over any player under him for at least 4 more years. 3. **Luka Doncic** - He's already shown that he's likely gonna be a MVP candidate and a centerpiece for a team at age 20. Undeniably the best of both worlds player in terms of youth/talent. 4. **Anthony Davis** - He doesn't seem like he can play the alpha role, but regardless, the talent level is through the roof. Still relatively young as well, but slight issue once again with his injury history. 5. **Nikola Jokic** - Best center in the league and also has the youth. He's also shown he can make a winning environment around him. 6. **Giannis Antetokounmpo** - He gets knocked down a few pegs due to his lack of winning intangibles yet to be shown. But he's still pretty young and his talent is ridiculous so that keeps him in the top 4. 7. **Kevin Durant** - This is the big ""what if"" sorta thing. What if he can return back to his normal self following his injury? Arguably the best player in the league if he does, for at least another 2-3 years. Also, he has age-friendly talent. 8. **Donovan Mitchell** - This is my bias pick. I just believe in him. The dude has some of the best intangibles I've seen in a young player. Overall love his demeanor and he shows a bit of that mamba mentality. 9. **Jayson Tatum** - The youth is strong on him, and also has shown he's able to improve year after year. He's shown me enough to allow me to acknowledge that he can be big-time. 10. **Damian Lillard** - If he was in the right situation, he probably would have had a few chips under his belt. He has the mindset I look for most in a player - just a killer mentality and insane work ethic and love for his craft.  **Honorable mention:** *Jimmy Butler, Jamal Murray, Devin Booker*  **Q &amp; A:**  1. *Q: ""Why the disrespect on Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons bruh?""*  **A: Embiid has a horrid injury history. More importantly, he also has shown no winning intangibles and his work ethic is not admirable to me. Previous sentence also applies to Ben Simmons, except it's worse for him.**  2. *Q: ""No KAT anywhere? Not even an honorable mention?""*  **A: KAT is an amazing talent.. like unbelievable talent for his position. But, he doesn't have any box office draw nor has he shown any winning intangibles. He looks like he plays for individual accolades and nothing much more beyond that.**  3. *Q: ""Why are you doing a Q &amp; A by yourself, with questions made up by your own? You're so narcissistic.""*  **A: I don't know why... maybe I should delete this section...... NAHHH! Just hit submit!**"
"&gt;I think very few Laker fans were delusional enough to want to ride out Zo/Clarkson/Ingram/Randle/Bryant over getting Lebron fucking James, maybe a few wack jobs didn’t want him there, but his arrival was pretty well appreciated.   What about so many fans screaming ""Bought not built"" to discredit the Lakers 2020 championship?"
"Yeah I don’t think Cleveland fans give a shit about him leaving since he came back and defeated the will of the heavens to break the curse and get that city a title.  I think very few Laker fans were delusional enough to want to ride out Zo/Clarkson/Ingram/Randle/Bryant over getting Lebron fucking James, maybe a few wack jobs didn’t want him there, but his arrival was pretty well appreciated."
"Right so he's won 2 MVP and has averaged 23.7/11/4.8 in the playoffs (40 games total) despite only being 25 years old but he can't carry a championship team. Thats a poor take if you're gonna say Giannis cant carry a championship team because he hasnt won a ring by age 25 then you've gotta say James Harden/Paul George/Nikola Jokic/Joel Embiid/Kevin Durant cant carry a championship team either cause none of those guys have won a ring ""carrying"" a team. Hell in a couple of years you can add luka too that category too after lebron and AD threepeat."
Has been since GS.  Bron cannot and will not guard him; actively switches off even to a smaller defender. KD willingly guards Bron and is better than average at it.  KD scores better.

"Westbrook. Even during his MVP year people argued he shouldn't even make the All-Star game because ""his stats didn't matter"" despite OKC being more likely to win if he got a triple double.  Steph Curry. Dude was a unanimous MVP and people treat him like he's a circus fluke instead of a vital player with multiple rings on a team everyone hated only because they were too damn good.  James Harden. Found his niche and went full steam ahead. He's not a ref - not his fault he keeps getting the calls.  LeBron James. Greatest player of this generation whose greatest fault seems to be he's not MJ and didn't play by the same exact rules, as if either of those things are his fault.  KD. He's a grown man who gave ten years to an upstart that never got back to their sweet spot. He was kinda shady about it and handled the backlash like a brat, but none of that changes his game. He was able to be great on a team that already had greatness, got his rings, and made another move. He got injured trying to push through for his team. Did the image damage himself but his skills are solid."
Nate Robinson is the player that is closest in height to the average American male.  Iverson not too far off.  And to think that Nate Robinson has a block on (Heatles version) Lebron James. My god.
"[Per the report](http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/in-taking-control-of-lebron-tyronn-lue-has-created-a-monster-in-cleveland/):  By letting James overwhelm him in the huddle during timeouts, Blatt unwittingly ceded control — and demoralized the rest of the team. By not being comfortable enough to rein in James, the dynamic of the team became one of LeBron and then everybody else.   ""They felt they were doing this for LeBron,"" the person familiar with the internal workings of the team said, ""instead of with LeBron.""    Lue changed that the moment he first told James in a huddle, ""Shut the [expletive up]. I got this,"" according to a person who heard the exchange -- and a few others like it. If Lue was going to get the stars and the role players to buy into the strategic changes he was determined to implement — play faster, space the floor, move the ball, take full advantage of Love's versatility — he was going to have to restore order first."
"&gt; Only LeBron James ($32 million) earns more from sneaker endorsements than Durant’s $26 million per year Nike deal, according to Forbes. Irving is seventh at $11 million behind Russell Westbrook ($12 million), Zion Williamson ($13 million), James Harden ($14 million) and Steph Curry ($20 million). Michael Jordan is still the unquestionable king earning $130 million per year from Nike.   This is pretty surprising.  I didn't realise Kyrie was behind Russ/Zion and half of Curry. His shoes have always been super prominent, I thought he'd be making more than he does.   Looking at the list, I would have had him closer to ~18m."
"It’s so hard to quantify “all time great” when ur name isn’t Michael Jordan or lebron James. Imo it’s more just a feeling, like you know it when u see it. Seeing Steph play and how he’s changed the game u just know he’s an all time great without having to justify him being an top x player"
KD  Steph Curry   LeBron  James Harden  Kyrie Irving
"Cool. The Lakers currently have the only person to seriously challenge Michael Jordan as the greatest of all time (Lebron James). They have Anthony Davis, who is the best ""big man"" in the league as well as the best defender. They just won the championship, tying the league record for most by a franchise.  They are easily the greatest franchise in NBA history. The most sustained, consistent success throughout each decade. The most iconic team history.  In the Laker fanbase, you'll find more hardcore, knowledgable fans than in any other. You'll *also* find more idiotic, delusional homers than in any other. You'll find diehards and bandwagoners. We are the most beloved team, and the most hated.   If you want a scrappy team with a great, humble coming-up story, look elsewhere. If you want Real Madrid or Man U, here we are."
"LeBron James: ""Every time I go, I'm in arenas or go to the grocery store, little kids coming up to me, 'Ay, Ay, aren't you LeBron James? Yeah yeah that's me. 'Why did Jason Terry outplay you in the NBA finals as a 33 year old 6th man like that?”"
I just want y’all to kno that Lebron James is the goat
"I think he's been considered a *potential* GOAT since he started in the league.  When he won three championships, and four MVPs, that potential seemed to be almost realized.  All he needed was three more championships and one more MVP.  How hard could that be?  Especially after he teamed up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami.  Well, it turned out that LeBron and his super team did not win six championships in Miami.  He did not even win three or four in four years.  He lost one, won two, lost one, and returned to Cleveland.  Then the Warriors came out of nowhere and won three championships in four years, while LeBron won one more, albeit overcoming a super team in the process.  He also started to rest during the season, both taking games off and playing less defense, saving himself for the playoffs, and therefore stopped winning regular season MVPs.  **So as of 2016 LeBron was considered second best and it seemed unlikely that he would ever be considered the best based on conventional standards.**  When it became possible, maybe even probable, that LeBron would not win six championships and five MVPs like Jordan, let alone surpass him, fans of LeBron James moved the goal posts.  Suddenly they started to devalue awards and championships and one-season records and started to value career production.  They changed the standards.  *I'm not saying they were wrong to change the standards.*  There's a good argument that career productivity is a better measure of greatness, less reliant on luck and more appreciative of endurance.  I'm just suspicious of their motivation.  It seems result oriented.  In other words, the eye test told them LeBron was the best ever, and they were looking for a standard that would prove it.  The problem with this reassessment is that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, not LeBron James, arguably became the best player of all time instead of Michael Jordan.  But never fear!  Assuming LeBron plays even a few more years, he'll pass Kareem's career productivity and become the most productive player in NBA history.  If he wins more Finals, and more Finals MVPs, that will cement his place above both Kareem and MJ.  **So as of 2019, LeBron was either second best to Jordan or second best to Kareem, but seemed certain to surpass Kareem.**  He was still second even to his fans who had move the goal posts, but first was definitely in sight.  **Some would argue that happened in 2020, and that LeBron is now the GOAT based on career productivity plus four MVPs, four championships, and four Finals MVPs.  Some disagree.**      Some would say maybe he needs another year or two to become the consensus GOAT, but that it looks like he'll get there for sure.  Some are holding out for another championship and another Finals MVP.  And yes, some insist that he has to win two more championships and two more Finals MVPs to become the clear GOAT (and even then Jordan will have the better peak).  **So my assessment is that in 2016 LeBron became a clear number 2 -- although it wasn't clear who was number one.**    **In 2020 LeBron became number one based on his entire career, ahead of Kareem, with Jordan still having the better peak.**  I'm not sure LeBron will ever have the better peak.  But if he wins more championships and gets awarded more Finals MVPs and continues to rack up amaziing career stats, perhaps Jordan's peak performance will matter less and LeBron's career performance will matter more."

"This definitely. And we'll have another cornucopia of ""LeBron James is a bad defender"" posts on r/nba until the playoffs."
Also the fact that LeBron averaged 31.4 and didn’t win scoring title yet Carmelo who averaged 29 ppg won a scoring title. Does that mean Melo scored more points than James did because he won a scoring title for averaging 29 and James didn’t win it averaging 31?  Also people need to really look at how many shots per game players are taking during their scoring title winning seasons. One guy averaging 27 FGA in a season and winning scoring title over a guy averaging 22 FGA should be looked at for context.
"It’s possible to be efficient and not skilled. There’s a reason Giannis gets exposed offensively in the playoffs. He has mediocre basketball IQ and an inability to generate a bucket in the half court when a defense crowds the paint / plays zone.   Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Lebron James, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, Stephen Curry, James Harden are players I trust to get me a bucket when I need it most. They can beat double teams, shoot over defenders, and so on. At the very least they have the ability to play make out of a double team.   Giannis needs to develop at least a jump shot to be considered a *skilled* offense player."
"This aside is mostly an attempt to preempt the unavoidable “but they haven’t done it yet” criticism of Antetokounmpo and Harden, as if that fact would be dispositive. Both players have led teams that were clearly good enough to have made the Finals. The 2018-19 Bucks were (sadly, from my standpoint) an overtime away from a likely insurmountable 3-0 lead in the Eastern Conference Finals, while the 2018 Rockets should be more famous for nearly beating the juggernaut Warriors than they are for missing 27 straight 3FGA. To put it another way, if we adopt a rule that excludes the last three MVP winners from the top category, what are we doing here?  This isn’t to say either player is without reproach. Harden’s defensive foibles and over-reliance on step-back 3s are issues. Meanwhile, Giannis’ inconsistent jumper and likely related playoff struggles against set halfcourt defense have derailed Milwaukee the last two seasons. Further, as mentioned in the discussion of Luka Doncic in Tier 2, there should be concern that the way these two teams are built to make these stars so much their respective focal points could serve the narrative double whammy of maximizing regular-season wins and production at the expense of playoff flexibility and adaptability. The very efficiency in team construction that a heliocentric style allows could mean these squads are left without a Plan B and certainly without Plan C against well-prepared opposition.  But enough about the demerits, let’s turn our attention to the positive, starting with Harden. Basketball-Reference recently introduced a new set of metrics called “Adjusted Shooting,” which attempts to demonstrate how much better or worse than league average a player is at various categories of shots. They have called one such stat “TS Added,” which is essentially the number of points above what a player using the same amount of shooting possessions would have scored. To illustrate the degree to which Harden is the best offensive engine in the NBA, his TS Added of 227.5 points was the most in the league by over 30 points (second place was Damian Lillard at 197.0). In other words, Harden’s combination of scoring usage and efficiency was 15 percent better than the next closest competitor. On top of which, Harden finished 23rd in the league in playmaking usage rate.  While many people are critical of the Rockets’ style in the Harden-Mike D’Antoni era, given that especially in the last two seasons it has amounted to three or four players watching and waiting for Harden to get them open, it doesn’t work if that trigger man is unable to perform at the highest level. In the last four seasons, Houston has finished sixth, second, first and second respectively in Offensive Rating. It may not be pretty, but it has been effective. At least in the regular season.  The limitations of the system have shown up in the playoffs, as the burden placed on Harden and the lack of much deception has either worn him out or allowed defenses to better scheme him, or more likely a combination of both. Over the last four playoff runs, Harden has hit 33.3 percent of his 3-pointers in the first three quarters of games, but only 25.2 percent in the fourth quarter and overtime periods, with the swing of his shotmaking (essentially, the difference between what a player actually shot and their expected accuracy given characteristics of the shots taken) being greater than 10 points comparing first three quarters to the end of games. So that’s not great.  But especially as the Rockets have become more, um, cost-conscious in recent years, this style and Harden’s performance within it has allowed them to have the level of regular-season success which makes these abbreviated playoff journeys disappointing relative to expectations.  In Antetokounmpo’s case, there isn’t really any question over his impact on both ends of the floor. With the possible exception of Zion Williamson, he’s the most destructive paint scorer in the game, and by leaps and bounds the best transition scorer in the league where he averaged 8.8 fastbreak points/100. LeBron finished second at 6.5/100, and the gap between the two is as large as the gap between James and 32nd place in the league. Giannis won Defensive Player of the Year (though I would have voted for Brook Lopez). But Giannis was certainly worthy of the honor as evidenced by his league-leading DRAPM), and he was named First Team All-Defense for the second year in a row — he was second team in 2016-17. His jump shot is suspect as he hasn’t shot above 30.7 percent from 3 since his rookie season, and after several years in the mid-70s, he fell to 63.3 percent from the line in 2019-20. He lacks a go-to move in the post and doesn’t have much of an in-between or floater game to deal with the masses of bodies he encounters in the paint, especially in the postseason.  But to a large degree, these problems are enhanced and highlighted by the team around him. The Bucks’ collection of shooters is just dangerous enough to require defensive attention during the regular season, when large-scale adjustments are difficult. Come the playoffs, opponents are better able to decide who to essentially ignore (more or less everyone but Middleton and George Hill). Giannis and the Bucks couldn’t solve this problem against Toronto last year, nor against Miami this year, hence coming up just short. The issues I’ve noted with Harden and Antetokounmpo are real and meaningful. But every player, even in this tier, has warts you could pick at, and the separating factor is as often as not the players who have success have been placed in rosters and systems that hide rather than emphasize those shortcomings. For this reason, I’m not going to hold the imperfectly constructed team around these two players against them, keep them in Tier 1A  **Kawhi Leonard:**  To say the Clippers season ended in disappointment is an understatement. Especially after LA built a 3-1 lead on Denver in the second round, the expectation was that we would get the Lakers-Clippers Western Conference Finals that had been widely anticipated all season long. Of course it didn’t happen that way. Much like the rest of his squad, Kawhi appeared to tire as the series wore on, managing only a 53.4 percent True Shooting in the final three games after hitting at a 55.9 percent rate over the first four. A year after he was the ultimate playoff destroyer en route to Toronto’s first title, Leonard couldn’t run it back with a new team.  It happens, but it shouldn’t be taken to invalidate the greatness of a player who on a per-minute basis was the second most impactful in the league over the course of the season, finishing behind only Antetokounmpo in single year versions of RAPM and PIPM. In the last few years he hasn’t provided the aggregate value in terms of regular season wins and production as the other players in this group, and he likely never will given the chronic nature of the knee condition that forces him into one of the league’s more aggressive load management programs. But he proved in 2018-19 with the Raptors that if that regimen can get him to the playoffs in good health, he can take over from there.  Worth noting that for a player who made his name as “the Klaw,” a terrifying defensive force around which no dribble was safe, his weaker metrics are all on the defensive side of the ball. In some ways, Leonard’s career arc illustrates the way in which player’s defensive impact tends to shrink as their offensive roll increases:  Even if his game-to-game and possession-to-possession impact has waned, he retains the incredibly sticky hands that have kept him in the top 10 in steal percentage every full season he’s played aside from his second year in the league, when he was 13th. In recent years, deploying him on another team’s best scorer has been one of the chief defensive weapons in his team’s arsenals. For example, in the 2019 Eastern Conference Finals:  He has replaced that defensive presence with something more valuable: efficient, high-volume shot creation. Over the last two seasons, he has been fourth in self-created shots per 100 behind only Harden, Doncic and Derrick Rose. Over those seasons, his combined 51.1 percent eFG%, (compared to league average of around 48.5 percent) is 24th among the 128 players with at least 500 attempts. This season, he even added a significant playmaking role with a playmaking usage of 12.7, in roughly the top 8th of the league and the highest of his career by far.  His not-so-distant success combined with the fact that he is continuing to improve and add to his game are why it would be foolish to let one poor three-game stretch cause him to be considered outside of the very best in the game.  **LeBron James:**  The King stays the King. If there were a Tier 1A+, James would probably occupy it all by himself. After LeBron suffered the first serious injury of his career last season, breaking his streak of consecutive NBA Finals appearances at eight (still one of the more absurd and underappreciated stats of this or any other era), and missing the playoffs completely for the first time since his second season in the league way back in 2004-05, wondering if James was starting to slow down just a bit in his age 35 season was reasonable. Much like the last time he experienced a dip in certain performance indicators (dunk rate and rim-finish rate chief among them) during the 2014-15 season, James came back with a vengeance. Now entering his age 36 season, it has to end sometime. But I think we’ve all learned the lesson that we need to see it first rather than anticipate the end coming for (perhaps?) the GOAT.  Until then, in (and at the head of) Tier 1A he stays."
"Here's the explanation from the article on the tier 1A/B guys. I'm going to omit some of the tables and graphics just because that would take some time to upload, but I can do so if people are interested:  **Tier 1B: The Great Unknowns**  This group consists of two all-time greats with big questions after they missed all or most of the 2019-20 season. On past production and achievement, each would easily fit into Tier 1A, but after last season there are questions.  **Kevin Durant:**  Let’s get this out of the way up front: I have no idea what a post-Achilles-tear Kevin Durant looks like and neither does anyone else. He’s in this category, for now, because of three reasons.  First is just as recognition of where he was as a player prior to the injury; he’d be not just Tier 1A, but also in the discussion for Tier 1A+ with LeBron James. Second, this is where the Nets need him to be for their gamble on him last offseason to be likely to pay off. I’ve tried to avoid tiering on wish fulfillment as much as possible, but Durant is an inflection point possibly for the entire league. Finally, it is a matter of convenience to have the space to discuss KD at length at the start of this tier rather than buried under the 5,800 words in the Tier 2 write-up. But what can we expect? Past history suggests he won’t be as good. From the linked 2013 study:  Seven players never returned to play an NBA game, whereas 11 players returned to play 1 season, with 8 of those players returning for ≥2 seasons. Players who returned missed an average of 55.9 games. The PER was reduced by 4.57 (P = .003) in the first season and by 4.38 (P = .010) in the second season. When compared with controls, players demonstrated a significant decline in the PER the first season (P = .038) and second season (P = .081) after their return.  That’s a sizable decline, but recall where Durant is declining from. PER is an imperfect, offense-focused measure, but on that metric, a 4-4.5 decline from his peak would still give Durant somewhere around the 10th to 15th highest mark in the league. There simply hasn’t been a player on Durant’s level to suffer this injury before, and we’re left to wonder what parts of his game are more likely to be affected than others and how that changes his profile. Some of the problems of comparing pre- and post-Achilles injury production is that several prominent players who suffered the injury either never really returned to significant action (Mehmet Okur and Mario Chalmers) or were already deep into their 30s, complicating the evaluation of declines given those seasons were in age ranges where a sizable diminution in ability should be expected (Kobe Bryant and Chauncey Billups).  Further, some players aren’t really apposite comparisons, either because of a completely different positionality (Brandon Jennings) or that they were players on the fringe prior to the injury (Jonas Jerebko). That leaves a few examples of starter-level players of similar age (Durant was 30 at the time of the injury) and at least passingly similar size or style of play. Elton Brand and Wes Matthews suffered their injuries at 28, while Rudy Gay was 30. The areas I would most expect to see an injury-related decline to show up would be in rim-finishing and foul-drawing. Additionally, I wanted to look at overall defensive effectiveness, as this has been an enormous part of Durant’s postseason value over his career. Here are the relevant stats in the three to four seasons (depending on the timing of the injury and return to play) before and after each player suffered his injury:  There is a little bit of a range of best, medium and worst cases between the three, but we can probably anticipate some decline in Durant’s ability to get to the rim and perhaps his finishing once he does, while possible effects on defense are more equivocal. If I were an optimist, I would suggest that Gay is the most similar to Durant in terms of both style of play and body type, though it should be noted that Gay is significantly stronger and bulkier, so perhaps better able to compensate for decreased mobility with increased physicality. Durant also has some attributes Gay does not. He’s still close to 7 feet tall with an enormous wingspan, and one of the great jump shooters of all time:  Among the players named up there, Durant has managed this with the most difficult mix of shots by a decent margin. Only 19.7 percent of his 3-pointers have been uncontested, the next lowest percentage among those players is Tatum at 34.2 percent, ranging up to McDermott at 48.5 percent. This suggests that from an efficiency standpoint, Durant has some wiggle room by increasing his shot quality, something that should be possible given the sheer amount of on-ball creation ability the Nets have between Kyrie Irving, Spencer Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert.  Barring the absolute worst-case scenario of Durant being functionally done (an outcome for which there has been no evidence of even suggestion of as a possibility), Khris Middleton in Tier 3A seems like an absolute floor for his offensive contributions:  That outcome still represents complete disaster for Brooklyn — one of the reasons I find the early over/under line of a 49.5 win pace for the Nets to be extremely interesting is that based on Durant’s outcome they are likely to be either much better or much worse with not much in between.  As a final point, there are all kinds of reasons why comparisons between the leagues are fraught, but it’s fair to say Breanna Stewart is of similar stature in the WNBA as KD is in the NBA. Here are her last two postseason lines, one before and one a full season after her own Achilles tear:  Though Stewart suffered the injury at 24 instead of 30, her averaging 28/8/4 on 50/50/85 shooting splits has to be taken as a good sign for KD.  **Stephen Curry:**  It feels a little dirty to not have him higher, but he’s 32 and it’s been four full years since he’s been asked to be the main focus of a team. I’m certainly interested in seeing what he looks like at the center of a more heliocentric offense. With the players in Tier 1A, we’ve seen them be that, in several cases over multiple years.  I don’t think I have to go too much into Curry’s game-breaking, court-geometry warping impacts. As the chart above discussing Durant shows, Curry is on the very shortlist for the best shooter of this or any other era. While Kyle Korver might have an edge in “alone in the gym” shooting skill and was an assuredly elite catch-and-shooter off of movement, Curry’s ability to do that plus do the same off the bounce is what lets him to surpass Korver as a “game-effective” shooter. Curry is the only player in the tracking data era who has attempted at least 250 pull-up 3FGA to make at least 40 percent of them (sitting at 41.3 percent, more than two full percentage points ahead of Chris Paul, in second place at 39.2 percent). Among the 10 top-line metrics I used for this exercise, Curry is first among minutes qualified players in:  * 5-year RAPM * 3-year PIPM * 3-year ORAPM * 3-year OPIPM * … and second in 3-year RAPM.  All of which is to say, if that player is what we get after what was basically a gap year, he’s Tier 1A with ease. But there is enough uncertainty that he is just a half step down. For now.  **Tier 1A: The Best of the Best**  Assuming health and/or sufficient playing time, these are players who could be penciled into four of the five First Team slots almost from the start of the season. It’s no accident this group contains the last three MVP winners as well as the last two Finals MVP recipients. Start with one of these players and you have a huge leg up toward championship contention. They don’t guarantee contention on their own, as there is too much talent across the league for any one player to have that kind of impact. But the margin of error is wider and the number of possible paths to the kind of roster that can contend is greater.  **Giannis Antetokounmpo and James Harden:**   Let me lead with a stat here. Since the 2010-11 season, 19 players have been named to All-NBA First Team at least once. It’s not a perfect overlap, but this is a reasonable first pass at players who have met the general criteria for Tier 1 in terms of being able to lead a team to the Finals as the best player. Of those 19, only five (LeBron, Steph, KD, Kawhi and Tim Duncan) have actually been the best player on a Finals team over the same period. Which is to say that in a league whereby definition only two teams can make the Finals each season (and one player has been the best player on 45 percent of the Finals teams over that period), the set of players who are good enough is far broader than the set who actually have. Managing a championship roster is hard, and it’s no accident that depending on how you count, around three-quarters of this decade’s Finalists were superteams of one form or another — I would certainly count all five Warriors, all four Heat and the first three Cavaliers among that group, as well as the 2012 Thunder, and we can quibble about the 2013 and 2014 Spurs or 2019 Raptors."
"Not completely related, but I actually just compared the top 100 scorers over the regular season and playoffs for the last three years (only 52 qualified if the list looks confusing).     [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZigJQbCWRsmka2OI3UT65gL6TiezFby0WBCzlb6vp2A/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZigJQbCWRsmka2OI3UT65gL6TiezFby0WBCzlb6vp2A/edit#gid=0)     The right side is the guys with the biggest improvements from regular season to playoffs in terms of points per possession and true shooting percentage.     13 guys with at least 300 minutes played in the playoffs and 3000 minutes played over the regular season since 2018 improved their scoring rates.     1. Jamal Murray (+4.1) 2. LeBron James (+3.9) 3. Nikola Jokic (+2.3) 4. Jrue Holiday (+2.2) 5. Donovan Mitchell (+2.1) 6. Kevin Durant (+1.6) 7. Anthony Davis (+1.2) 8. Goran Dragic (+1.2) 9. Jaylen Brown (+1.1) 10. Jayson Tatum (+0.6) 11. CJ McCollum (+0.5) 12. Montrezl Harrell (+0.1) 13. Kawhi Leonard (+0.1)  I'd say CJ McCollum is a good one, as Dame has consistently had bad playoff performances and CJ does a good job of stepping up to maintain that load.  Murray and Jokic being #1 and #3 is interesting too.  Was also surprised by Montrezl as he was a trainwreck this playoffs, so his 2019 series must have been better than I realised.     That's just scoring though, plenty of other facets that players could be doing that aren't recognised here."
"lol, that sounds like pasta.  But one thing is true.  I been to Miami so far 3 times in my life.  Twice for cruises, and once for roadtrip down the 95 to keywest.  And we were just struggling to find anything to do while we stop at Miami, at the end we decided to go to a heat game because well, Lebron James."
"Those stats are taking into account his out of order Game 7, if you assume Games 1-3 were statistical anomalies then Game 7 was one aswell so, Games 4-6 he shot 46/36/72 splits, which is very inefficient for LeBron, especially when you consider the FT shooting.  The point of the strategy isn't to ""stop"" LeBron James, he is a top 5 player ever, you can't stop him, but you can reduce his effectiveness. I would say that the strategy the Spurs implemented would be even more effective today, as he hasn't really improved massively as a 3-PT shooter since then and in 2013 he was in the absolute peak of his game and of his athletic abilities.  Holding LeBron to two great games in a Best of 7 series is a great accomplishment that teams should try to replicate, it's just hard to have a perimeter defender like Kawhi to throw at him and a big like Tim Duncan to spy on him in the paint, but if you have it, dare him to shoot and don't allow drives."
"MJ in 98 wasn't ""far better"" than Shaq, nor was that version of him the ""Greatest player of all time"". Ask yourself, if you are the 2020 Mavs, would you trade Luka Doncic for LeBron James?"
"wow. just gonna post the quote here for everyone to see.  &gt; Quote from Mike Tirico: “There (LeBron) is with his Mom, Gloria. Gloria sacrificed a lot. Gave birth to LeBron when she was 16 … on their own at 19, living on assistance, food stamps, and now here they are … it’s a great American story.”  &gt; (What about parents who stayed together, worked hard, provided for their children and put them through school? Since when did not practicing birth control and lucking out because of DNA become a “sacrifice”? I’m confused. Let’s just move on.)  What a truly reprehensible fucking thing to say. Imagine all the struggle Gloria James went through to get her son to this point, just to have this privileged asshole say this. I feel like this guy got so lucky not getting cancelled. He toned his ridiculous misogyny and racism down just in time for the shift in the culture. I actually think he was probably playing that stuff up for his readers to begin with, but that doesn't make it much better."
"Too late to take the charge and he went up for the contest anyway, the man is the definition of a pure basketball player who will always try to make the right play, even if it means taking one on the chin from the runaway train that is LeBron James."
The dunk was nasty but '11 holds bigger braggin rights but obviously one person is  lebron f'n James and the other is jason terry
"Wade was injured the whole second half of the season. The early part of that season? He was outstanding.   The Heat also infamously had Shaq, Toine Walker, and James Posey come back woefully out of shape and extremely unmotivated.  Riley literally suspended Walker and Posey for being so out of shape. Both were goners after the season.  Age was catching up to Zo and Gary Payton -- two NBA legends who played crucial roles the prior season. Both would retire after the season.  Age caught up to Shaq too, who was no longer an MVP candidate player. He missed half the season.  Wade, with basically no effective supporting cast, was lights out in the beginning of 2007. He was averaging 30 points, 6 boards, 8 assists, almost 3 steals a game and almost 2 blocks a game in January and February. (Checked this on basketball reference). I think this time period overlapped with at least one of those notable prime Wade vs. LeBron regular season battles where each had 40+ points.   Then Wade dislocated his shoulder (thanks to a collision with future teammate, and current Heat executive, Shane Battier). Wade didn't return to form until the following season.  The Heat brought back former team star Eddie Jones who filled in extremely well for Wade during his February, March, April time on the injured reserve.  No one really showed up to help Wade, who still wasn't fully back to form, in the playoffs, and the Bulls beat the Heat soundly."
Luka makes the same decisions in-game as Lebron James?
"If you are arguing that the Cavs would have been bad without Lebron James in 2018, I agree. The 2020 Lakers would have been too.   What’s the point of extreme hypotheticals? What is Kawhi wasn’t on the 19 Raptors or the Warriors don’t get killed with injuries. They don’t wins a title. But who cares - what does that even mean?"
"LeBron James or Raymond Felton   1A and 1B, whichever way you wanna put it"
"what you said makes a lot of sense but how many of those big guys also won b2b mvp + dpoy in the same year? Not even Lebron or KD has done that.   What I see the critcism from Bucks fans (your sub) is that he can't get it done when it matters. What I see the critcism from other fanbases mostly comes from him winning awards but not winning rings or taking his team to the finals. When you win MVPs and Dpoy, general fans will not be forgiving towards you unless you have playoff success and it will only get worse until he finally wins.  ppl forgot but James Harden used to be one of the most liked players in the league especially when he was on the Thunder. He made funny commercials which everyone loved and then when he got the WCF against the Warriors and underperformed (in the elim game), while also was runner up in MVP that year, he was crucified for it and the year after where they underperformed as a team."
What are you talking about? LeBron James gets that same excuse? He couldn't beat the KD Warriors; why would you expect Damian Lillard to? Dame is good but not generationally good.
Jason Terry outscored LeBron James in the 2011 NBA finals. Never forget
"That's the issue, Lebron James level of fitness is abnormal. What do you mean factually incorrect? minutes played heavily correlates with injuries lol. That's common sensical. I think you can just simply say he isn't the GOAT, because he wasn't as dominant as Jordan/Lebron. Jordan played same amount of minutes as Shaq....He was just more dominant for a longer stretch. Had shaq been a 73% freethrow shooter he would have more career points than MJ.   Does Kobe not have longevity to you?"
"Paywall  Pat Riley: ‘Jimmy chose us.’ Who will be next to choose Heat? Also, why Riley loves Butler BY ANTHONY CHIANG OCTOBER 26, 2020 09:44 AM  When it comes to the possibility of adding another superstar, it could be as simple as a player choosing the Miami Heat rather than a complex and elaborate sales pitch from the organization.  After all, that’s how the Heat landed All-Star Jimmy Butler despite having no cap space last offseason.  “Jimmy chose us. He chose us,” Heat president Pat Riley said during his season-ending news conference Friday. “He chose this team, this owner, this coach, this president, this city. He did. He chose us. And, we knew the first night that we met with them on July 1, he let us know that. ‘Stop. You don’t have to talk about it. Let’s talk about what we’re going to build here.’ And we drank wine and consummated a deal. ... He chose us.”  It could also be as simple as a player choosing to team up with the Heat’s All-Star duo of Bam Adebayo and Butler, who are considered two of the best two-way players in the NBA. Adebayo and Butler combined to average 35.8 points on 24.1 shots, 16.9 rebounds and 11.1 assists this past season.  “Jimmy is a whale or an orca,” Riley said. “He’s great for us to have as somebody that other players can look at and say, ‘Well I want to be somewhere like that where I feel that way about the team and feel that way about the city.’ Jimmy is very sincere. And we’re fortunate to have him. So it’s just a great addition to our team, our city, to our state, and to have all the young guys around him to help him those nights when maybe he might not be having the greatest night.  “I have not ever witnessed a player that good, who can do so many things and be that unselfish and not care about whether he gets 10 or 40 points or a triple-double or single digits. He just wants to win, and that’s what you want. And he knows when you have to take it to another level, he’s capable of taking it to another level. And he knows when other guys might be struggling, he says well ‘our shooting is not good tonight or we’re turning the ball over,’ and he just takes over. You need players like that in this league to advance far, and we’re glad to have him and we’d like to have some more if we could find them.”  The Heat needs to make a trade to add a max-level star this offseason. The league and union haven’t determined next season’s salary cap and luxury tax line yet, but the expectation is Miami can only create up to about $22 million in cap space, including cap holds, if it renounces the rights to its six impending free agents (Jae Crowder, Goran Dragic, Udonis Haslem, Solomon Hill, Derrick Jones Jr. and Meyers Leonard) and the cap ends up remaining flat with this past season’s numbers ($109 million cap, $132.6 million tax line) also used next season.  But the Heat is on track to enter the 2021 offseason — as long as it doesn’t commit any significant money past 2020-21 this offseason — with enough cap space to sign a max-level free agent. The 2021 free agent class could be headlined by two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo.  Along with Antetokounmpo, the list of those who could potentially be free agents in 2021 includes Victor Oladipo, Anthony Davis, Gordon Hayward, Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike Conley and Rudy Gobert. Also, Donovan Mitchell is set to become a restricted free agent in 2021, and LeBron James, Blake Griffin, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jrue Holiday and Chris Paul have player options to become free agents that offseason.  “We’re going to remain fluid,” Riley said of the Heat’s approach this offseason. “And whatever presents itself to us, we’ll look at it. As I said, first things first, and I don’t want to contradict myself. I’d really like to take care of our own [players] in some way shape or form. But we also want that other box to be filled, which is called flexibility. We’ll see what happens. ... We have a good idea of what we want to do, and I think we’ll stay the course on that.”  THE BUTLER-RILEY RELATIONSHIP  Butler’s love for Riley is well documented, noting during the playoff run that he’s “a huge reason why I’m [with the Heat].”  How would Riley describe the relationship he has built with Butler in their first season working together?  “My relationship with him this year would be one that’s outside of the box because I don’t want to get in the way of what Erik Spoelstra is teaching him and his coaching staff,” Riley said. “So we do talk and we text, they are short. He’s our leader, he’s our best player. So I don’t really want to interfere on that basis every single night texting guys. They probably get their phone blown up every single night. As long as he taps and throws me a heart back, then I’m cool. But we’ve had some good conversations, and those conversations are around what he does.  “He’s a competitor, he works hard, he’s in great shape. I think he loves it here and I think he loves it here because we don’t bother him that much. We know what he’s going to do and what he can do, and I think you can form a real bond sometimes with body language, with silence, with nods from my seat to the court without having to have long conversations with these guys. I love Jimmy Butler.”  ▪ How much longer does Riley want to lead the Heat?  “As long as [owner] Micky [Arison] wants me to do it,” Riley said. “If you guys would stop printing my age in every article, then nobody will think I’m 75 years old. So that’s the first thing. I love this, I love this team. This is one of my favorite teams now. So I’m here as long as Micky wants me here, and Nick [Arison]. I have a great relationship with Micky and now Nick, the CEO. [General manager] Andy [Elisburg] and I are fused at the hip, think alike, talk alike. We know what has to be done. To have Andy is incredible for me and to be able to manage Spo, this is a dream for me this late.”"
"Okay - here’s another star that signed with Cleveland: Lebron James.   Remember that time he left Miami and his best buds after 4 straight finals runs?   I know that one doesn’t count either though. Lots of teams have signed players of that caliber. Like 3 or 4. But still, I know, it does not count!"
"&gt; Lebron fan  lmao, so you mean you're a bandwagoner  &gt; Competent drafting  Ah yes the Kuzma who has regressed completely this season, Lonzo Ball who shot 30% from the field that they picked over Jayson Tatum, Svi Mykhailuk who they immediately offloaded to the Pistons  &gt; poor young players and their lack of development  Lmao just ignore the fact that Sexton averaged 20/3/3 over last year and 25.5/4/3 on 52 FG% and 43% 3pt%, and that we got Kevin Porter Jr for four second rounders lol  &gt; OKC had three mvp talents and turned it into nothing so yes they are idiots as well, but hey at least they got to the step of drafting 3 mvp level talents.  Yes and that means so much when they didn't get a single ring lol  &gt; Yes, the bucks are fucking idiots for not paying to keep their core, but again they're better than the cavs because they actually had an elite core that they went on to lose during giannis' early years.  Ah yes they're better than the Cavs after letting Brogdon walk and not having a single finals appearance, and for not getting a single adequate shooter for Antetokounmpo  &gt; Let's decide whether or not the hawks wasted Trae youngs' years, 5 years from now lol.  OK but they were never fucked by contracts like we were. After that one season where they won 60+ games and we swept them they traded all their players to tank.   &gt; And anyways none of this is even relevant because none of these players are lebron fucking james. Let's take a look at the mavericks, they've already surrounded luka with a perfect team for him, they've put him alongside an elite talent in porzingis, they have an elite coach hired (better than any of the idiots the cavs hired) and they'll accomplish great things in no time. That's a good franchise.  We hired David Blatt, who LeBron ran out of town after we got the first seed. We hired Tyronn Lue (who now is the coach for the Clippers), who isn't an idiot but he wasn't the right coach for a young team. We hired John Beilein, who everyone lauded as a great hire before the season started. Getting the right coach is luck to some extent.  Also, we would have won more than one ring if Kelly Olynyk hadn't ripped Love's arm out of his socket and if Kyrie wasn't injured, and if KD hadn't been a piece of shit and jumped to the Warriors. We got one of the best big threes in the league and it all fell apart because of KD. I don't think that's organisational incompetence, just shitty luck that we just happened to peak at the same time as pretty much the best superteam of all time."
"I am a LeBron fan, I understand that being a cavs fan has taken away all your brain cells, rather than blaming you I actually pity you. The cavs repeated draft failures have nothing to do with their location. The lakers got their young players through competent drafting (cavs would never find a kuzma or a josh heart late in the draft), give the cavs those same draft picks and they would have drafted much worse players and then failed to develop them. Look at your poor young players and their lack of development it's heart breaking.    OKC had three mvp talents and turned it into nothing so yes they are idiots as well, but hey at least they got to the step of drafting 3 mvp level talents.   Yes, the bucks are fucking idiots for not paying to keep their core, but again they're better than the cavs because they actually had an elite core that they went on to lose during giannis' early years.

"In the eyes of many, Lebron James is the Barry Bonds of the NBA"
"If I had to come up with a starting 5 who can legitimately cover all 5 positions I like to think about it this way... Can they guard James Harden? Can they guard Shaq?   Pippen could guard 1-4 easy... But he would struggle with a Shaq kind of guy   Bird could guard 2-4 but he's a bit slow covering a Harden/Curry and a bit too small to take on a Shaq/Robinson  Ben Simmons? I think he could guard all 5.  Magic? Again all 5. Lebron? He has little experience guarding centers but I think he could do it. Giannis? Probably struggles with the 1. He's fast. But I think he would struggle man up against Harden.  Rodman? Guards all 5.   The problem is finding guys to space the floor who can guard the 1 and 5. There's few if any who could do all that.   Lebron .344 Simmons .083 Magic .303 Rodman .231 Giannis .284 Luka .321 Bird .376 Durant .381 Pippen .326 Jokic .338 Garnett .275 Draymond .319 Havlicek... No 3pt line  Spot #1 Dennis Rodman 6-8 Rodman is #1 when it comes to guys who could guard the best ever at every spot. He was physical enough to be a small ball center against the best. And quick enough to cover Harden or Curry.   Spot #2 Ben Simmons 6-11 Can't shoot, can pass and defend with the best ever. Could match up with Shaq and also be the man coverage you choose vs Allen Iverson. I dislike this choice but struggle not to make it.  Spot #3 Magic Johnson 6-9 Can defend a center and skyhook with the best. Can facilitate as the point guard and even without his height would still be top tier.   Spot #4 Kevin Durant 7-0 Taller than he says, terrific shooter from everywhere on the court. Might struggle with 1 and 5 but won't lose a game for you. Tall and quick enough to push back threes from a 1, whilst being much faster than any post banging 5.   Spot #5 LeBron James 6-8 Great at... Well everything. Low effort of defense. Great in the paint, great facilitator, good rebounder, solid shooter. Would struggle with the leagues premier 1's and 5's but like durant, won't lose you the ballgame.   Offensively... 1. Magic 2. James 3. Durant 4. Simmons 5. Rodman   You struggle to shoot a 3 with this team, but pick and rolls would be unstoppable.   There isn't a single team in history that could hope to guard this team despite Rodman's sub par offense."

this shit makes no sense. why is the media dredging up a five year old interview from Hakeem when Lebron only had two rings at the time and acting like this is a recent quote?  you guys are literally being punked lmao. They said Hakeem recently chimed in the GOAT debate then literally uses a quote from this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xj0zNOV1nw&amp;feature=emb_title&amp;ab_channel=KJRawX). These recent articles read like copies of the [original](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/15/michael-jordan-far-superior-to-lebron-james-ex-nba-champ-hakeem-olajuwon.html).
"The [""LeBron James with no regard for human life!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beCxSqSXGDY) dunk is one of the most memorable dunks of all-time, but the actual dunk itself is pretty meh in my opinion. It's really only remembered because of the amazing sound bite."
Lebron James has a huge fanbase. More news at 10
"He is Blake Griffin. I said it since the first time I saw him play. Lebron checks every single box, if you were to pick a guy to clone 5 times to form an unbeatable team, it's just 5 Lebron's who train different skills. Zion is not that guy. He's certainly good, and his explosion and athleticism is very impressive. But he's Blake Griffin or Charles Barkley. He's not Lebron James."
"https://www.google.ca/amp/s/kingjamesgospel.com/2017/06/02/lebron-james-says-kevin-durant-difference-warriors/amp/  Lebron said it.   It’s clear as day. Again, the Warriors one ring without Durant was against who??? Please write me the Cavs starting 5.  The next year without Durant, what happened? Lost a 3-1 lead.   The Clippers blow a 3-1 lead and everyone laughs. The Warriors blow a 3-1 lead and this clown is saying they were 4 points away. Lmao fuck up. The nba has the worst fans. Double standard goofs. Almost winning is losing. You don’t almost have a ring. That’s never a real argument.   Give me some evidence to back up your point.  Lmao, foh"
Why would anyone predict the 0-3 Spurs would do anything to scare THE CHOSEN ONE LeBron James. I would say LeBron would be the favorite going in.
"2018 is also partly LeBron James fault because he kept the team hostage by not fully committing to the team.Rememver, they still had no idea if he was staying or leaving when they acquired Derrick Rose and Dwayne Wade."
That was in Cleveland actually. But Paul Pierce had gave him a slightly hard foul. And it happened right in front of his mom. Mama James started yelling at Pierce and that’s when LeBron said “sit your ass down”
That player... lebron James... jr
"I'm sure some of that was on Dray because even though he tried to play the suspension off as no big deal, I could sense that mentally he wasn't his usual self the night he came back from it. But that's not the whole reason Lebron (and Kyrie?) dropped 41 that night. It's because Bogut had a season ending injury in game 5 while Draymond was watching the game from an Oakland A's suite.   If you watched the first 4 games and esp the 3 Cavs losses, you will see that Bogut &amp; Dray when in together were really hampering both Lebron and Kyrie's drives to the rim. IIRC Lebron still did better than Kyrie, but both were not having a good time.  Game 3 esp... Lebron hat 19, Kyrie had 10. Bogut had 5 blocks, 4 in the 1st quarter. Iggy, Livingston, Steph, Barnes each had a block. Rebounding was done collectively. Steph and Klay didn't score much, but they both hit 4/8 from 3 and sat on the bench early as it was a blowout. Dray had a hyperefficient 28 points, 5/8 from 3.  After a not surprising blowout win by the Cavs in game 3 at home, in game 4 still at Cleveland, Steph, Klay, AND Harrison Barnes litght it up from 3, making 15 3 pointers between them, as Steph scores 38 including making 9/10 FTs, with Klay also making all 7 of his FTs to get 25 points. Dray just locked in playing defense; 12 rebounds, 2 steals, 3 blocks. But the fatal mistake that night was biting on James attempt to get under his skin and get a rise out of him by stepping over him almost as if walking slow-mo. And Dray got tricked. Like a fool.  You could tell the suspensions and Lebron's tactics had gotten under Dray's skin because in game 6 he was invisible, but in game 7 he was the only Warrior to actually show up. 32 pts, 15 rebounds, 9 assists, 2 stls. Made 6 of 8 3 pointers. 4 of 7 2 pointers. 4/4 from the line. And yes this is sad, but his BPM of -1 was the highest of all starters. He tried to will the team to victory, and it certainly felt like he was shouldering responsibility for being a dumbass.  Once Bogut went down, Warriors were playing smaller a lot more than they would've liked (they normally use the ""death lineup"" in short spurts), and having to give minutes to Festus Ezeli, who for some reason decided to perform worse than Anderson Varejão, 33 at the time and only 1 season removed from leaving the NBA entirely. What are you doing young man?  And yes, Harrison Barnes absolutely choked in games 5 and 6. In game 7, he wasn't great, but at least he made 2 out of 4 threes. That's a marked improvement over the past 2 doodoo games he had. Klay though: 2 for 10 from 3, 14 pts, 2 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 steal. Steph: 4/14 from 3. 2/5 from 2, 1/1 FT, 5 rebounds, 2 assists (just like Klay), 1 steal, 1 block 4 turnovers, including that famous GIF of the Larry O going out of bounds and Klay just has this look on his face like ""Come on man, what are you doing?!"" An even though Mo Speights didn't score, he helped out with 4 rebounds, and 2 blocks. Iggy, again couldn't score (thanks lebron chase-down block), but at least he played defense. 9 rebounds, 4 assists (as man as Steph &amp; Klay combined), 2 steals and 2 blocks.  Meanwhile, Kevin Love hustled hard, grabbing 14 boards, and guarding Curry expertly on his last 3 point attempt. Old man Richard Jefferson came up big as well, grabbing 9 rebounds and a steal. The Cavs outrebounded the Warriors 48-39. Same in game 6: Cavs outrebounded Warriors 45-35.   Game 6, Dray and Barnes wasted another efficient performance from Steph: 30 pts, 6/13 from 3, 8/9 from the line. Curry picked up 2 ticky-tack fouls in quick succession soon after the game started, forcing Kerr to bench him halfway through the 1st quarter. Warriors would get outscored 11-31 by the Cavs that quarter. But in the 2nd they outscored them 34-28, and in the 3rd quarter, Curry gets called for another ticky tack foul (so now he has 4 fouls) so again Kerr pulls him with 3 minutes left in the quarter. Warriors still outscore the Cavs 28-21. Klay comes up huge in the 3rd, with 15 points: 3/4 from behind the arc, and 3/4 on 2 pointers. Dray's head seems to be back int he game now, as grabs 5 rebounds and dishes out 4 assists, along w/ 1 field goal. It looks like the Warriors might just make up for the horrible 1st quarter performance when Curry sat out half the quarter after picking up 2 ticky tack fouls. Cavs 80 - Warriors 71.   The Warriors start out the 4th aggressive, and then Curry picks up 2 ticky tack fouls to FOUL OUT OF THE GAME. He has literally never fouled out of a playoffs game (let alone a rs game, IIRC). He's playing incredibly passively on defense, and he was only able to muster 1 3 pointer and 1 2 pointer before fouling out with about 5 minutes to go in the game. Surprisingly, Dray is also called for 2 fouls in those first 7 minutes of the quarter, bringing his total up to 5. He's one foul call away from being out of the game, just like Steph. And now with Bogut out, Festus and Varejão sieves on defense, and not really being good rim protectors like Bogut or Dray, Dray comes out of the game with around 5 minutes left. This is when Lebron sense blood, as there' no Steph to keep going hot from the previous 2 quarters, and Dray can't play until much later, unless the game is blown out by then. And, sadly, it does become a blowout, with Lebron scoring 17 points int he 4th quarter. Kerr had inserted the Brazilian Blur Barbosa to pick up the offense and he played most of the quarter, scoring 9 points. Mo Speights came in and in a span of 2 minutes knocks down 2 3 pointers. Alas, it isn't enough just to try and keep up with the Cavs without Steph or Dray, which they did do, as the Cavs only outscored the Warriors 35-30 int he 4th. However, that miserable performance in the 1st ended up deciding the game, and ticky tack fouls called on Curry especially ruined the night, as did those on Dray.   So, yeah, lack of rim protection really hurt. Ticky tack foul calls as soon as Dray comes back from his suspension leads to Curry fouling out for the 1st time in his career and gets Dray 5 fouls with 5 minutes left int he 4th quarter, as the Warriors are attempting to make a comeback from the 20 point deficit they had in the 1st quarter, which they got down to a 9 point deficit by the end of the 3rd quarter.  So yeah, if you watched the games, you'd know that it was as simple as  &gt; lebron dropped 41 on draymonds head as soon as he came back"
Imagine being a fan of LeBron James and consequently supporting whatever team he's on  Fucking wild concept to wrap your head around innit
the GOAT conversation is now between Jerry West and LeBron James
Or maybe Pat Riley’s unprofessional behavior towards LeBron is worse than anything LeBron did  He called him a coward on national television/has repeatedly taken shots at him through the media for the last five years  And had to be stopped from writing a racist slave letter   Or maybe Pat Riley snubbing Dwyane Wade the man responsible for five finals appearances  Money they used on Dion waiters/Kelly Olynyk/James Johnson lmfaooo he did the greatest player in the history of your franchise dirty for three bottom of the bench guys  And yet in this equation LeBron the guy who brought the most success to your franchise is who you hate?  You’re a goofy weirdo  Anyways keep justifying your irrational hatred for literally the best player you’ve ever had and will have
How am I attacking you?  You really think he told them draft this rookie and I’ll stay? Lmfao a team with no depth Dwyane Wade with no knees  Why should he be obligated to stick around for Shabazz Napier? The heat made that decision and LeBron had no obligation to stick with them for doing so  What team did the decision screw up?   No there isn’t he brought you four championship appearances and two championships and then decided to leave once his contract ended he didn’t ask for a trade he didn’t do anything unbecoming he had no obligation to Miami beyond his contract  It was the World Cup you goof if you’re going to slander someone get it right  Yes fuck Pat Riley slave owner mentality bitch i’m supposed to respect him because magic/Kareem/James Worthy won rings? Lmfao I could win three championships with three first ballot Hall of Famer’s  Also I love how you’re so stuck up on LeBron watching the World Cup but not the 68-year-old boss going on national television and asking if he’s man enough to stick around  Or the boss having to be stopped from writing a slave  letter   Pat Riley cost himself LeBron instead of acting like the racist fake tough guy he is he could’ve I don’t know put a capable team around LeBron so they don’t collapse in 2014

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
Lebron James made the finals once in the 2000s. His dominance started in 2011.

Imagine playing like 5 NBA games and being as hyped as LeBron James was in 2003. Dude is on the beltway to being a bust unless he wakes up. Can’t believe even Obama went to see one of his college games.
LeBron James went to LA to cash a check and lose
Really only Lebron got Rings criticism recently as a youngin. You can't throw Giannis scrutiny under Rings Ernie.   His scrutiny is because he doesn't have ANY great playoff games. Jordan James Shaq ALL had historical games before rings and before MVPs. Giannis has 2 MVPs DPoY no historical games
"Lmaooooooooo every single Raptor thrown at him and they all got fucked.   Also, a reminder that the Raptors needed Lebron james to be out of conference AND injured to win a championship. I'm 1000% confident that Lebron + Ingram + 3 guys off the street would have beaten the Raptors."

She's wearing a Vince Carter jersey and some strained yoga pants.  Ask to myself, who the fuck is that.  Realize I’ve only been a fan since 2014.  Fucking God’s Plan.  Get off work, take the subway home.  Stop into the ACC for a drink or twelve.  Fucking vendor cut me off after six beers. $108 dollars wasted.  Whatever, not even buzzed. Brampton blood.  Get to apartment, check messages.  Mom calls me and says three of my cousins were shot in Etobicoke today.  Less than usual, a good day.  Get out of DeMar jersey, put on 6 God jammies.  Check under bed for Paul Pierce  What the fuck, he's there.  Run to the kitchen, see dad sent me a cheque.  Go to open envelope.  Run to bank, teller says it’s fake and this is bank fraud.

"That's no surprise. He's on the third axis of transcendence right now. Kyrie Irving moves in anti-planar reality (or prime-planar reality, shouts to my qmech nerds who really buy Frisch-Hayes.) While guards like Mike Conley or Chris Paul see the game from an x and o perspective, Kyrie has vision of the omega and delta factors surrounding any given basketball event.   There's a reason Kyrie was able to lead LeBron James to the 2016 Finals. Put simply, Irving is visuospatial jazz. Think of Ornette Coleman or George St. Breux, not Goran Dragic or PatBev. The dorian stylings of a Eric Dolphy better describe Irving's game than a monotone listing-off of conventional basketball skills. Ball handles? When you're in constant tune with the precise Hz pitch of the hardwood like Irving, English words like ""good handles"" cannot encapsulate even a fractoid of the scientific and metaphysical majesty of Kyrie."

I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  One of my favourites as well."
I still remember this LeBron James masterpiece against the Raptors.  He was exceptional during those playoffs.
"MVP, FMVP and DPOY: Lebron James"
"Lebron James and Michael Jordan, as weird as that seems most people (excluding stans of each other) have them as one and two. Obviously hot take artists are loud but they are the greatest to ever play the game and only someone delusional will deny it."
LeBron James prefers to focus on the games that really matter :D
"If the Heat had beaten the Lakers, Pat Riley would never have uttered such a sentence.  Pat Riley was disappointed to see LeBron James leave the Heat at the end of the 2014 season.  Since then, he has never missed an opportunity to criticize him."
so if michael Jordan came into the league at 1984 that man got eliminated 84 85 86 87 88 89 and 90 the pistons and the Celtics whooped his ass every time ima tell u something else I used to watch the ngga scored 67 in one game against larry bird and still lost the game so it dont matter how great u are u not gon win by urself it is a TEAM sport michael jordan all 6 finals michael Jordan played against he went against first he went against the lakers that was magic johnsons last year he had aids james worthy and byron scott was out of the series cus they was hurt so it was just michael jordan against a sorry lakers team the next year he go against portand trailblazers who didn’t have nobody but clyde Drexler and who? kevin duckworth? aww he sorry who else did they have? jerome kersey? aw he sorry and then who they go against the next year? the phoenix suns? u had charles barkley and who else? kevin johnson and dan marley? man them nggas aint no competition and then u left if he was so good when u left the bulls to go play baseball Michael Jordan u left the bulls after u left the bulls they had won 58 games the next year they won 56 games with scottie pippen so that let u know scottie pippen was still hoopin cus even after u left they still went to the end of the playoffs and almost made it to the finals and went 7 games with the knicks so what u talkin about? Then he came back and played the seattle supersonics in 94 and the seattle supersonics who did they beat? nobody went to the finals once played gary payton man u sorry and then who u play after that? a 34 and 35 year old john Stockton and karl Malone? That’s who u went up against? a old ass Utah team? so what u won 6 times so what? Lebron done went 8 times already u already done went 6 times lebron gon finish beatin u in scoring and assists he gon be the leading scorer of all time kobe aint even in the conversation kobe u sorry as shit if kobe was that damn good kobe was on a team with shaq shaq had the 3 mvps shaq had them 3 finals mvps u wasn’t even the best player on ur team bro so then guess what happened to u then u got yo ass whooped by the Detroit in 2004 detroit whooped that ass Detroit put yall ass out what happened? Detroit beat yall 4 to 1 kobe was over there crying with tears runnin down his face I remember that he was crying like the little hoe that he is and then guess what else happened guess what else happened that same team that put kobe out them same Detroit pistons guess who beat em the next year? Lebron james. he beat em with nobody on his team he scored 34 points in a row to put them nggas out he mighta got swept in the finals against san Antonio but so what he made it just like if Jordan was good enough in 88 to get past the pistons which he wasn’t but if he did and woulda went against the real showtimes lakers he woulda gotten swept ass wept by magic johonson and his team hell when Michael Jackson beat the damn lakers kareem abdul jabbar had already retired man get out of here with that Michael Jordan shit yall ypung nggas don’t know nothing im old I watched all that shit Jordan he was good but guess what he used to kick it over to paxson. money. he used to kick that over to bj Armstrong. Money. he used to kick it out to steve kerr. Money. Them nggas was money u kno what im sayin? Scottie pippen best 2 way player first team all nba defense hall of famer what is yall talkin about this ngga done went in aevery finals he played against it was only 1 hall of famer on the other team. Lebron going agsinst 4 hall of famers they had to get 2 mvps and 4 all stars to beat this man. they cant beat this man u better crown the king god dammit crown him
"It’s funny because people are only freaking out about this because he used the word asterisk, which tbf he probably shouldn’t have because NBA fans have a weird obsession with this word. If he had said ‘we will always wonder if the results might have been different if dragic and bam were 100%’ then nobody would have cared. Also this is pretty clearly what he meant, but r/lakers2 fell for some clickbait headlines without reading the article (like usual) or the full quote   “I would like to see what it would be like with everybody whole. We’ll get our chance again. The Lakers have the greatest player in the game today in LeBron [James] and Anthony Davis. They beat us fair and squarely. But there will be always be that asterisk; if we had Bam and Goran 100 percent — Goran was our leading scorer [entering the Finals] — it might have gone to a seventh game.”  Then the media chose to run with the headline “pat riley says lakers title deserves an asterisk” when they could have more accurately described it by saying “pat riley wonders if finals could have gone to 7 games if heat were fully healthy.” Or if they’re just running with random parts of the quote with no context they could have gone with “pat riley says lakers beat the heat fair and square” lol"
"Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give LeBron James and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
One run doesn't make a player better than another lmfao. Was LeBron James no longer a top three player from 2009-2011 just because he was dogshit in the 2010 semifinals and the 2011 Finals?
Lebron James...Jr.
"“Not being good enough to lead your own team” isn’t a metric 2k uses for their ratings, so that discussion is neither here nor there. Even if it was, he and Bron orchestrated the Cavs offense— no one except 2011 Wade has ever been good enough to lead a Lebron James team. Being a supremely talented scorer, arguably the greatest ball handler of all time, and a respectable playmaker though, with only passable defense sounds about right for a 90 point guard."
It’s LeBron James
"LeBron James in his second finals trip with the Miami Heat (Finals stats):  44.1 mpg, 28.6/10.2/7.4 statline.  What are you on about? 2011 was bad yes, no disputing that."
"Ah, I understand. You're an overreacting goofball. It's ok, there were people who said Lebron James was overrated and garbage after the 2011 finals. Turns out that was incorrect.  Players have some bad games, even bad series, and still be incredible athletes. Even the best have off days."
"Closest thing I could find was this [bleacher report article](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2705681-pat-riley-says-he-took-lebron-james-heat-exit-personally-and-was-very-angry). Riley didn't explicitly state it, but he was thinking it at that time."
"The NBA has seen some unique cases where young players join talented teams.   Bill Russell to the Celtics.   Magic and Bird to the Celtics.   Duncan to the Spurs.   Kobe to the Lakers.   As a result we've seen a lot of top-15 all-time guys win early then win often.   As a result, when guys like Jordan and LeBron needed a few years to win, people start doubt them, not realizing that the teams they got drafted were stack with future HOFers.   &amp;#x200B;  It's not like LeBron got drafted by team that had Robert Parish, Kevin McHale, Dennis Johnson, and Bill Walton, or Jordan got drafted by a team with Kareem, Norm Nixon, James Worthy, AC Green, Michael Cooper, and Byron Scott (I realize some of these guys joined the team later).   &amp;#x200B;  With respect to Giannis, I get the criticism this year.  People aren't taking issue with the fact that he didn't win a title; they are taking issue with the fact that didn't beat a team that they had a significantly better record than and that he played poorly.  And I think that is a fair criticism.   Had they beat the Heat and lost to the Celtics in seven games and he played well, I don't think people would take an issue with Giannis not winning it all this year. Or had he lost in the finals."
LeBron James.
"Essentially LeBron's group was watching a world cup game when Riley came to their hotel room to meet, and he had to ask them to mute it at one point. You can read more [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2017/04/pat-riley-lebron-james-miami/amp)"
"This is exactly what I’m talking about. Giannis “took a shot” at Harden one time, while joking around, being egged on by Charles Barkley. Harden got his response shot back, that was it.  “Yeah we targeted James Harden defensively, while AD and LeBron and Kawhi were on the floor, and failed at it and lost while I played badly” is a Ben Shapiro WAP-level self own if you want to look at that as trash talk for absolutely no reason, and Harden would be a Paul Pierce-level hot take artist to genuinely believe Giannis’ game is literally just run and dunk and takes no skill.  There’s absolutely nothing in it except media types looking for those juicy MVP race stories and everybody just bought it for no reason. Then still have the balls to look down on ESPN sensationalism."
neither. give me the james  lebron james  james harden  jameson curry  some other james
"Skip Bayless be like: ""LeBron James saved LeBron's legacy"""
Damn a team with Curry KD Draymond Iggy Klay beat Lebron James with JR Smith as his best option
Bronny- Son of LeBron James.
"Doesn’t seem too surprising. He’s in the NBA because he can play 15-20 minutes a game, set up an offense and get 3-4 assists while your starter rests. He’s also one of those guys who just plays hard, hustles on defense and dives for balls and shit lol. Also, I don’t think most role players in the NBA are taking care of their body like they are LeBron James, especially when it comes to recovery. Dudes 30 now, a millionaire, a father. He can’t jump.  Steve Nash was 6’3” and never dunked in an NBA game. He has one credited attempt but there is no footage! [There’s a funny thread on this sub from 5 years ago when a guy was searching for it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3firog/does_anyone_have_footage_of_steve_nashs_only_dunk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) Best guess in that thread was thinking it was a layup that got blocked before the ball left his hand and was incorrectly counted as a dunk attempt. Apparently, if anyone could find the TNT broadcast it wouldn’t include the dunk attempt because it happened early in the first quarter and the first game of the double header went into overtime. Anyway, that Nash kid was pretty good."
"He's literally not though. Google is free, and searching up ""Tobias Harris/LeBron James contract"" isn't difficult.  Also the 76ers gave him the contract they did because you **need** to overpay talent to remain a contender, that's simply how it works."
I’m LeBron James
Rachel wants it. It’s LeBron James what else u expect
"Then what are we talking about then, if the scoreboard is all that matters then Bill Russell is the GOAT and Robert Horry is better than LeBron James AND Michael Jordan.  This ain't tennis, basketball is a team sport and you can lose while being the best, as proven multiple times by all-time greats."
"That's our problems as sports fans to refute his point don't even focus on just last year. There is not a single stretch in Kawhi's history where over a stretch of 3 years he outperformed or performed on par as lebron. If you hold him to that reasonable of a standard this whole kawhi argument falls apart and why we should be asking is kawhi better than james harden before we even get talking about KD, Lebron and Curry."
"Jeez bro stop posting isolated clips. Yes, he's capable of making threes from all spots.   But he's most likely to shoot from the left elbow area:https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/lebron-james-shot-chart-by-season-2020  If he's dribbling or catches the ball in that spot, he's shooting because he's confident in that shot. So why not try to gameplan when he has the ball in that area?"
"LeBron James exhibited what's unanimously considered his greatest offensive play-off run against the Golden State Warriors led by Kevin Durant and the most feared shooting duo in NBA history according to those who live and breathe the game. Was James LeBron, by your own definition, dominated by Kevin Durant in a vacuum(?), as Isiah mistakenly  claims he did to an evidently superior performer. Would it make sense for Kevin Durant to boast about dominating LeBron?"
Was hoping Lebron James  would be Lebron Jamesic
"Are we going to pretend like it hasn't been the same exact core of people in the Finals and Conference finals for the past decade?   If success can only be defined as winning a championship, then I can count on one hand the players who are a part of the winning formula.    Westbrook is entertaining, doesn't cheat you on effort, and gives you as good a chance to win a ring as any other player not named Lebron James. I dont care what anyone says, I would want Westbrook on my team any day."
LeBron James from downtown!!
"Big 3 in LA  Lebron ""Ray Allen"" James shoots game-tying 3 to save Giannis' legacy.   Who says no? /s"
"Last year:  “The Lakers have given LeBron James permission to speak with Anthony Davis, which will typically be tampering, but is allowed as LeBron granted himself permission.”"
"Steph Curry is 21-14 against LeBron and 15-7 in the playoffs, which includes a 3-1 Finals record, so he DOMINATES LeBron James.  Steph's five toughest players he faced are CP3, Tony Parker, Tim Duncan, Blake Griffin and Kawhi Leonard. LeBron is only the 5th toughest player he faced. Just head to head, Steph is dominant over LeBron.  See how stupid that sounds? It's actually insane that nephews are here defending this Isiah quote. Isiah's opinion about Michael has as much weight as Paul Pierce's opinion of LeBron, they are salty af."
"It's a stupid excuse, because if you apply to anyone else it doesn't work. If when Michael beat the Pistons they were old, then when LeBron beat the Big 3 Celtics in 2012 they were ancient, as Allen, KG and Pierce were 35, 34 and 33.  The Pistons had zero players above 35 and their three best players were 27, 29 and 29, Rodman had been in the league for five years at that point. MJ beat them fair and square, they jumped on him when he didn't have a squad, but when Pippen became an All-NBA caliber of player, they got obliterated.  Zeke's opinion on Jordan has as much value as Paul Pierce's opinion of LeBron James, which is zero."
"MJ averaged 27/9/5 in 1988 to Isiah's 20/4/10, 30/6/7 to Isiah's 21/5/8 in 1989 and 32/7/6 to Isiah's 18/6/9 in 1990, Michael lost each time.  MJ dominated Isiah in every way shape or form, Zeke just had the stacked team and won. Saying that Isiah dominated Jordan would be like saying Paul Pierce dominated LeBron, it's asinine and makes no sense.  If you swap their jerseys, MJ sweeps Isiah and the Bulls every year. Whatever Isiah says about Michael has as much value as what Paul Pierce says about LeBron James, they are salty af and can't give props to their rivals."
"Contracts like Conley's will continue to happen as long as max contracts keep working the way that they do. The problem isn't that prime Mike Conley wasn't worth 35 mil/yr, market wise that is his value. The problem is that Steph Curry is worth 60+ mil a year, Giannis is worth probably 80+ mil, Lebron James is probably worth 100+ mil a year, but the max contract system makes it so you only have to play Lebron a smidge more than Mike Conley, and any team with a player in that ""star but not a super-star"" category gets screwed by comparison."
"Lebron Džejms is written like that in serbian especially because that's exactly how the pronunciation of his name sounds like. They simply write english words as they are sounded or meant to be pronounced. Labron Đejms is a similar derivation of that.  However in Hardens name James is obviously his first name, so to ''balkanize'' his name and make it as the OP says ''yugoslavian'' we exchange the first name with a balkan version and only translate the surname."
"Plus RJ/Mitch/Randle?  that would be a fuckin fun-ass team in the East.  I think what's lost in the era of super-teams is how much fun it is to have an intriguing team, even if they may not make it to the finals/be contenders on paper.  So many teams are an eyesore/boring to watch, especially out east.  At the end of the day, there is only 1 champion, and 1 Lebron James, and these teams need to start to understand it's just as important to to have a fun team than it is to have a contending team. Having bad contracts but a good culture will be worth it."
"Lebron James is the best passer I have ever seen and I am 35    It aint about assists, I know people will say Stockton, but its Lebron."
"Why is ""James"" in ""LeBron James"" written as ""(Labron) Đejms"". But ""james"" in James Harden written as ""Janez (Hardonja)""?"
He outplayed Lebron James in 2014 and won FMVP.   /s
"Current players, because I won’t pretend to evaluate players I didn’t watch or that I watched when I was 10.   G Jrue Holiday G LeBron James F Kawhi Leonard F Giannis Antetokuompo C Rudy Gobert"
My inside sources tell me the Heat are trading Kelly Olynyk for LeBron James
The year is 2050. Every NBA roster top-to-bottom is now a 6'9 super athlete that can shoot from half-court.  90% of shots are pull-up threes with 20 seconds left on the shot clock.  Head coaches and GMs are now former Goldman Sachs analysts that utilise Excel to determine the most efficient time for an athlete to breath.   Lebron James is entering his 20th prime. Bronny James Jr Jr is about to enter the league.  Half the NBA is Dwight Howard's illegitimate children.
"I am not entirely sure that people who arent just here to use their twitter thumbs actually think PG is overrated. I dont much care for his attitude, and I wont lie in that I loved him getting shit on, but he is absolutely a game changer, especially when healthy. Part of the problem is his shoulders have been shot for the better part of like 2 or 3 years, but the times when his shoulders have been healthy hes deadly. We all saw what he did on his mvp esque stretch in OKC, hitting big game winners, playing smoother than butter, etc. Besides that hes always a two way player, hes constantly top 10 in deflections, so he is worth every penny of his contract. He def underperformed in the playoffs, and he needs to learn how to keep his mouth shut, but he is also the scape goat for a much larger problem. Clippers would be foolish to get rid of him for anything less than like a LeBron James or Giannis Amdbfjueodjdmpo."
"I think if Lebron only won rings with the Heatles, people wouldn’t value them as much. Winning in Cleveland and LA is what really solidified James for most people.    Maybe the same will happen with KD if he wins without Golden State"
"MJ, Big Mike, Mike J, Jordy J, Michael "" Lebron James SR"" jordan.  Michael Jordan."
"Lebron ""Lyndon Baines Johnson"" James"
"Tim Duncan and Allen Iverson as well as the budding talent of a 19-year-old LeBron James, 20-year-old Carmelo Anthony and a 22-year-old Dwyane Wade was ""garbage"" ok. And he did have a very good supporting cast for the Olympics but we are talking  two guys that averaged 10 and 1 for a couple years. And Luis Scola who was actually a great baller but im sure there have been more talented individual college teams and the other 5 guys that got chances in the NBA were mostly because of that Olympics run."
They should trade for CP3 and James Harden while holding onto Lebron and AD....and then get Giannis next year to have him as the 6th man.
"Here's mine:  1. LeBron James 1. Kawhi Leonard 1. Jimmy Butler 1. Jayson Tatum 1. Paul George 1. Khris Middleton 1. Jaylen Brown  1. Pascal Siakam 1. Brandon Ingram 1. Gordon Hayward  Hard to put KD in the top 10 until we actually see him. He's an easy #2 under normal circumstances (and a potential #1 as LeBron ages) but we have no idea how he'll look going forward, Achilles are often career enders and Durant already had a building list of injuries.  I also see 7-8-9 as being pretty interchangeable for now. It really depends on who has the better offseason."
"In 2017,  he was like a absurd +20 or something on the floor and they lost purely because that team had no depth to do shit.   2018: Utah was just bad all around, Carmelo, Paul George the whole team just underperformed. You can’t look at Russ and say he’s the reason they lost.   In 2019: Thats the year you can say him and Playoff P are the reason they lost.   2020: they lost to the better team, and eventual champions Lakers that had AD and Lebron James..while the Rockets center was 6’5"
"LeBron James and James Harden led teams are both near the bottom in ball movement every year like the Thunder.   A ball stopper is someone who keeps the ball stagnant, not someone who catches and shoots.  That’s like saying Klay is a ball stopper"
"He doesn’t iso nearly as much as Harden though ... Literally no one in the NBA does. It’s not about being assisted, he literally has more off ball movement and catch and shoots to his game than Harden by FAR.   Harden isolated 45% of the time this year. The next best was Westbrook at 25%.  In 2019, KD isolated 15.6% of the time. Lower than Bron, Westbrook, Kawhi, Chris Paul, and many others.   15.5% in the year prior. Again, lower than many of those names including LeBron James.   14.9% in his last year in OKC.   He’s teetered around 15% while James Harden was at 3x more this year ..."
To say it in the most simplest terms and also he has postseason success i get what you mean about ability but you need it to translate to success in the postseason ya feel that’s the difference of KD being better than James harden but not lebron
"   This guy has the right idea but is wrong  He says that the leagues have had the same number of titles awarded to teams in the last decade. (He also forgot the Bruins and Mavericks so 2011 just doesn't exist to this guy I guess)  However, he does not consider the number of different teams who made the finals in the last decade (I will be going from 2010-2019, those numbers help the NBA but it won't matter)  NBA: Lakers, Celtics, Heat, Mavericks, Thunder, Spurs, Cavaliers, Warriors, Raptors (9 teams)  NHL: Blackhawks, Flyers, Cannucks, Bruins, Kings, Devils, Rangers, Lightning, Penguins, Sharks, Predators, Capitals, Golden Knights, Blues (14 teams)  Vegas being in the finals is just more proof that the NHL is much wider open than the NBA. A team with no true superstar (except Fleury I guess) grinding their way through the playoffs and pissing off Canadians everywhere. The last NBA team to make the finals with a bunch of role players was the 2005 Detroit Pistons (even then a guy like Ben Wallace or Rip Hamilton might have been considered a star).  Also, LeBron James was in every finals from 2011-2018. In the NHL the only star player to come close to something like that was Marian Hossa 2007-2010. The difference is that LeBron played for two different teams (Heat and Cavaliers) while Hossa played for 4 different teams (Senators, Penguins, Red Wings, Blackhawks)  While both leagues are competitive in nature. The NHL is by far the hardest league to win. There is no debate"
"2013: Game 6 Lebron James (32/11/10/3/1)  More of an emotional pick but that 4th quarter performance bearing the last couple minutes was the best performance I remember. The headband got thrown off, Mike Miller lost a shoe, and Lebron just refused to lose. Ran out of gas late but then Ray Allen hits the 3 and the rest is history.  I feel like people forget how incredible Lebron was to bring them back because of the shot."
Because LeBron James is better than James Harden
"Just like the Lakers guards couldn’t keep up with Dame &amp; CJ and then Russ &amp; Harden and then Murray right??.... OH WAIT THATS RIGHT, the Lakers had great perimeter defense during this playoff run. Wow lol.  And AD is not a terrible passer off the post, he’s not amazing sure, but he’s not terrible either lol. What, you don’t think other teams didn’t think to try and double AD during these playoff runs? Lol they did and they failed whenever they tried, cause there’s this guy called Lebron James maybe you’ve heard of him, that makes it pretty hard to double AD, which is why they are an amazing duo  There’s literally not a single soul on the Spurs that can stop AD, I mean splitter? LOL don’t make me laugh, old as dirt Duncan? LOL please, with the way AD was hitting his shots, there’s literally no one that guard him specially not those 2  That Spurs team really has become overrated for beating a Heat that was basically Lebron and a bunch of washed up players running on fumes at that point  And oh yeah the 2020 Lakes never got pushed to 7 games like that Spurs team did in round 1 lol  Edit: reading that last part of your comment again is making me laugh. You really think that Lebron and AD will get completely neutralized lol, BY WHO??!?!"
"The problem is they keep putting people next to Harden that think they're on Harden's level. It simply isn't the case. When you play next to Harden and you're not LeBron James or Giannis, you're gonna have to admit you're not the best player on the floor. Humility goes a long way, if it doesn't, you end up like Carmelo Anthony (pre-Portland).  Plus, the only reason the Rockets are successful is because they can build around Harden and make him greater. Taking a singular approach in Harden is why they've been successful and why Harden averages 35ppg. Add in another star, the star thinks he's there to be a star, but he's just another role player for Harden.  Harden + role players is the only way it'll work. CP3 knew that, but he's always been a facilitator so it was a perfect combo. Also, CP3 didn't want out, and he especially didn't want to end up in OKC. Harden and CP3 just didn't get along unfortunately."
The spacing of that team is absolutely horrendous for a LeBron James team
"Maybe LeBron’s hypothetical twin sister could LeBran James, or LaBron James... or maybe LeBron Janes?"
How would that even be possible? That’s some Kevin Durant Luka Doncic Lebron James Michael Jordan type shit.
How would one go about acquiring a LeBron James?
See? It’s so simple. Why doesn’t everyone get them a LeBron James?
So what you're saying is that the Bucks should trade for LeBron James? I agree.
who's the better wing: Mario Hezonja or LeBron James?
LeBron James or James Jones?
Wouldn’t it just be LeBron JaMes?
"Only 7 minutes of clips? Half of these are in transition defense or bringing the 4 or 5 out to the perimeter. James Harden, Lebron, KD have hours worth of this type of footage."
Yeah and jaylen brown is almost as good as lebron james.
Pretty sure he played with his buddies not some manufactured team    Link https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2017/08/24/lebron-james-chris-paul-aau-program-photo
"You mean like Lebron James when he fabricates his alarmism of saying ""we're being hunted""? Do those words matter? I hate Trump more than you do, I just also have enough of a brain to realize Biden isn't the answer either."
LeBron James might disagree with :)
LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD FOR WICKER BASKETS!!!!
"Obviously they are allowing us a chance to thank them for loaning out their hometown hero, notable Miami native LeBron James."
"Not to be mean, but man was it funny when James Jones just let LeBron take Tyson Chandler, and all of r/nba talked about it like it was a big deal. In every thread about it there were 20 Suns flairs saying he was washed and couldn’t move or jump anymore.  Then he goes nuts in LA, diving after lose balls and get game winning blocks and shit and every Suns fan was pissed.  It didn’t last but it was fun while it did."
"Nah they know it but they also rightfully believe that the names ""Steph Curry"" and ""LeBron James"" are gonna get the most eyeballs on Christmas."
"Weak take.  They faced each other a total of 35 times in NBA games. Stephen Curry has a 21-14 winning record over LeBron James, including a 15-7 record in Playoffs."
Lebron James.

Is the trash a Lebron james led team that made the finals.
"I think there you could run into a nature vs nurture debate. Sure their could be NBA talent in New Hampshire but for whatever reason never pick up a basketball. Iowa as a state has waaaaay too many gold medals in wrestling for its population but also Iowa is to wrestling like Indiana is to boys basketball and Texas is to football. It has an environment to where if you like wrestling there is a support system to make you the best you can be. I never went out for football but according to the quarterback from my senior year I would have been a great DE as at our 3A level anyone bigger then me on the line I was faster and anyone QB/RB that was faster then me I was bigger. Now if I started football 7th grade could've I gone to college on a scholarship for it? Maybe. It is impossible to know because I never did. A top level wrestler at my school couldn't shoot a basketball if is life depended on it so you could have the ""Lebron James"" of Lacrosse being raised in Seattle where Lacrosse isn't that big of a deal so the kid plays basketball and is a high school starter for some rural podunk town at best in that sport."
"Posts like this reminds me of the sad reality that will eventually arrive...”NBA legend LeBron James dies at 90” or “Celtics star Jason Tatum has passed away at 87”, and my grandkids won’t ever understand or even care about them."
"I am a gay black guy and I can personally say that Lebron James did nothing for me, my life was only changed a little bit and it was for the worse. Everything was so much better under Luka Doncic though. I felt respected - which I never do when the Lakers are involved."
"&gt;Did you see Pierces clutch stats earlier? I don’t know what Melo has but I’d bet Pierce is better.  And your bet would be wrong.  &gt;What’s impressive about Anthony is how he maintained the shooting percentage with such a high volume of attempts.  &gt;The former Syracuse basketball great is one of only seven players to take over 100 “hero shots” since 2004-2005. LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Joe Johnson, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant and Dwyane Wade were the others.  &gt;Only Anthony, James, Johnson and Durant shot above that 30 percent average.  &gt;Anthony has the highest shooting percentage of that group of seven, but took fewer shots than everyone but Joe Johnson.

"&gt;Lebron James/Tom Brady - One of the best to ever do it  i absolutely hate when brady gets compared to lebron/jordan because it's just not warranted. lebron and jordan are by far the two best players in their sport's history. they were held to obscene standards, particularly lebron. the same cannot be said for brady  look at sunday night's game. so many people are running around trying to giving any blame to brady at all for the game ""Because the whole team was bad."" imagine if that shit happened to lebron. you think he'd get a pass for his performance because danny green was also bad? fuck no, you're a GOAT you have GOAT standards  brady is praised like a jordan-level GOAT yet he's held to the standards of someone like kobe.   he's one of the best qbs of all-time but imo there is no qb in the history of the game who is head and shoulders ahead of their peers like lebron/jordan was."
"I was waiting for someone to say this, if you don’t believe it listen to “the truth” when he talks about LeBron James"
"Yes, because having James Harden run PNR, ISO, and finish on transition every possession with a 5 out offense has proven to be unstoppable in the playoffs.  LOL getting one good offensive player and surrounding him with a bunch of defenders does not have a great track record of working. Even LeBron had Rondo to run a half court offense when he was out."
"I absolutely 100% hot taked that he would be an NBA MVP perennial All Star during the OKC Miami finals. Would I have bet my life on it? No, but I was on the James Harden hype train after then. Became then and still is my second favorite player in the league behind Lebron James."
Notice how I didnt say either a) The Pels beat the Lakers b) Jrue was able to successfully guard LeBron James.
You count on what's worked for you for half a decade now which is Draymond in the playoffs when in shape being a generational defensive player who can also protect the rim at a high level despite being 6'5 which is what other teams like Houston dont have.   Kevon Looney/Draymond Green/Klay Thompson/Jrue Holiday/Stephen Curry vs Markieff Morris/Anthony Davis/LeBron James/KCP/Danny Green or whomever. Is it a guarantee itll work no of course not nothing is in life. But you take your chances and more importantly you dont build an entire team around trying to matchup with one team in particular that's how you end up with the shit show Philly did.
"I thought you were making a meme, something like (Lebron) James on(Steph) Curry"
Damn and now he's carrying LeBron James to Championships. Crazy.
The title clearly says LeBron James and voting. Turn the channel and relax.
Just because he isnt a better PF than AD or LeBron James doesnt mean he isnt better than your PF
"Whenever there is one of those questions of ""What lived up to the hype?"", regardless of the topic, I always think of Lebron James. He is one of the only high school athletes I have seen on the cover of Sports Illustrated or was even nationally known by people who don't follow recruiting classes, and he has become arguably the GOAT. The only other athlete I can think of that even resembles that is Bryce Harper, but even he isn't anywhere close to the level of Lebron's success."
"If you watch the last 5 minutes you will see Bosh puts up 0 points, 1 rebound(best rebound ever), Makes Tim Duncan miss once, gets a steal that should of been giving to Chalmers he deflected the pass.  Lebron last 5 minutes 5 points, 1 rebound, 3 TO but if you watch them one Parker flops gets a bad call, two Kwahi just picks his picket, third one was only turnover that was his fault him and Bosh miscommunication on a lob. He legit gets the shot before the shot hits a 3 with 20 seconds.  Bosh gets the clutchest rebound which helped them win but Lebron James hits the shot with 20 seconds if he don't hit that Bosh don't get that play. Besides that play Bosh had 1 stop in 5 minutes.  Bosh/Allen/James all had their own part in that win but Allen shot doesn't happen without a Bosh rebound which don't happen without a Lebron three"
"Unless you’re Lebron James.  Not just the team or school built around you, but the whole world has its eyes and expectations on you to be “that” guy."
"Steph Curry Klay Thompson Lebron James Draymond Green Anthony Davis  It’s tempting to throw in a bunch of top 5 players but fit and synergy is important to me.  The personalities are balanced. There are two vocal leaders on the floor and a defensive anchor that’s impossible to score on down.  The warrior’s primary core already have excellent synergy and are pretty selfless by nature. In fact, the entire team is pretty selfless so the ball movement would hum.  Dray and AD anchoring the defense downlow. Lebron will act as a swiss army knife. Steph can rotate as the primary ball handler or move off-ball. AD threatening the lob from both Curry, Dray and Lebron.   It’s going to be hard to beat this team in the modern era IMO. Just a well-rounded team."

"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard (specifically 2016), LeBron James, Hakeem Olajuwon   There are obviously better players but Klay is the best 3&amp;D player of all time and doesn’t need the ball, Kawhi at that point was an all time great defender, elite 3 point shooter, and was willing to play in a system like the Spurs. Steph’s shooting is invaluable especially when his defense can be made up for with other players. Hakeem is arguably the best rim protector in history and he should be able to still defend at a similar level in today’s game plus you can just give him the ball in the post if you need a basket."
PG: LeBron James  SG: Michael Jordan  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Dirk Nowitzki  C: Hakeem Olajuwon
"Personally I would have a lineup like this:  PG: Steph Curry  Gives us invaluable spacing/gravity and his ability to interchange between on-ball and off-ball will be instrumental with a team with many ball-handlers.  SG: Michael Jordan  Is also an amazing off-ball player and gives us our go to scorer. He also gives us tenacious perimeter defense to cover Steph's deficiencies.  SF: Lebron James  Our primary playmaker and swiss army knife. Gives us invaluable versatility offensively and defensively.  PF: Larry Bird  Our other swiss army knife and secondary playmaker. Gives us great rebounding and solid post defense as well.  C: Bill Russell  With so many offensive weapons, we need a defensive anchor to tie everything up. Bill Russell gives us all-time rim protection and is pretty switchable. He also gives us all-time rebounding and can act as a great playmaker on offense."
I will tell my kids this was LeBron James
"I dunno, for one you have to have near Kobe-level shotmaking to make that approach work, the game has moved away from hero ball and even then with his incredible skill it didn't always work as well as it could have for Kobe.    Kobe still hurt the Lakers in the 2004 pistons, trying to show everybody it was his team and shooting nearly twice as many shots as shaq despite shooting 38% to Shaq's 63% in that finals.  His insistence on shooting the last shot wasn't always a boon to the team either, shooting a below average [39%](https://www.theballzone.com/2019/07/lebron-james-clutch-stats-vs-kobe-bryant-clutch-stats/#:~:text=In%20the%20clutch%20period%20Kobe,shooting%20and%2032.5%25%20from%20downtown.) on clutch shots.  His last couple years were a train wreck too.    I'm not saying Kobe wasn't great, but I'd put his innate athleticism, size and coordination all well above Mamba Mentality when describing why."
"To me, he's just outside the top 10 alongside: Hakeem, Moses, Dr. J and Kevin Durant. As a point guard, he's the 2nd best right now, but Curry will probably finish ahead of him.   He didn't win enough before he got old and joined Kareem. Between 1960 and 1970, he missed the playoffs 4 times and lost in the 1st round another 4 times.   Most importantly, he set the mold for tall point guards who can score too like LeBron James or Luka Doncic"
"James Harden vs Saben Lee, tough one  LeBron James vs Chuma Okeke: one of these is the best player in the nba, the other is LeBron James"
Nah bro Lebron James would whoop Colby's ass/s
&gt; I remember when Colby Covington was spouting shit against Lebron. People actually started saying Lebron James would easily brutalise Colby Covington in a fight.  Classic r/NBA armchair fight analysts who probably believe James Johnson is some MMA killing machine turned basketball player.
Bam is more athletic than Simmons? Simmons is probably the best athlete in the league not named LeBron James
"&gt; I remember when Colby Covington was spouting shit against Lebron. People actually started saying Lebron James would easily brutalise Colby Covington in a fight. Just insanity. For the record I hate colby covington as much as the next guy, but he would murder the entire NBA roster 1v1. 1 leg kick, 1 double leg, and it's over.  People on this sub constantly think that NBA players could just be pro-level athletes in other sports if they felt like it. People talk about Nash's soccer ""skills"" because he headed a ball in a dunk contest once.   We saw what happened when the greatest basketball player of all time tried to play baseball, and it wasn't exactly pretty. We've seen what it looks like when HOFer Charles Barkley swings a golf club.   If Jon Jones or Tyson Fury claimed they could play in the NBA, we'd all laugh. But that's just as stupid as some folks pretending like NBA athletes could easily transition to other sports."
I'm just dumbfounded how or why people would think someone could stand a chance against someone who actually trains and focuses on fighting. It's like people thinking Lebron James would actually stand a chance against Colby Covington. Colby would destroy him and make him look stupid.
Where do you people come up with questions like this...?  Could Lebron James train 1 year and beat a world class fighter whos been a martial arts practitioner his entire life... and literally a GOAT in MMA fighting in Jon Jones...?  I don't understand how you can even come up ewith this question.

"I’ll go with 96. 4 of those players are first ballot Hall of Famers. Jermaine O’Neal’s peak is that of a Hall of Famer, but his career unfortunately never materialized to such a standard due to injuries. He was still a top big man in the league in his prime. In addition, Kobe is a arguably top 5 all-time player, Ray Allen is arguably the second greatest shooter ever, and Nash is a top 5 PG of all time arguably.  03 has 4 hall of famers, and arguably the GOAT in LeBron James, but the 5th player, David West, was, at best, a fringe all-star at his peak.  96 takes this one for me."
"And no, Lebron James would not beat Colby Covington"
What a triggered lil Lakers bitch you are ... look at you go... 1 mention of JJ Barrea and you're OFF HAHAHAHAHA... u can't debate b'ball properly or effectively so what do u sprout?

"Shuddup fool, I was watching Jordan dominate Finals whilst you were just a twinkle in ya dad's pants... I also watched a LeBron James 8pt Finals performance where he was outplayed by.... (checks notes) JJ Barrea hahahahahahaha pipe down ya ass hat"
Larry Bird is definitely better at basketball than LeBron James. LeBron is definitely the superior athlete. Athleticism doesn't equate to basketball skills.
He’s living in LA. His name is Lebron James
"&gt; That's a qualitative decision you and others make.  This isn't an opinion.  Everyone with a rudimentary grasp of economics understands that LeBron James makes less under the union-negotiated CBA than he would under the counterfactual of no NBA union (as evidenced by the fact that any team would gladly sign him to the maximum contract available, or by the pay of top players in non-union sports such as soccer).  This, by definition, means that he is underpaid."

"There’s a great [Planet Money episode](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/07/11/628137929/episode-427-lebron-james-is-still-underpaid) on this same idea. Worth a listen. One thing they point out that was left out of this post is that a player’s value to a team is not simply the games that player helps win. Even with mediocre seasons or playoff outcomes the cavs were still selling more tickets, concessions, jerseys, broadcast rights  etc. which in turn has value to the owners."

That supposed Jordan quote about Zion in this video had nothing to do with Zion Jordan was talking about Lebron: https://streamable.com/mudqn4
"I've already supported the argument it's easy to make. He has the defensive metrics in his favor. You can't name a player who has come up with more important defensive stops in his career than Lebron James. You can't name a player who has defended the best players in the league better than Lebron James. He literally is the best defender in the league when he wants to be.  The only thing he doesn't have is narrative and people like yourself upset with him for not going 100% all the time. But like I've demonstrated, the other star players making all-defense teams aren't going 100% on defense either AND they're not being as good defensively as Lebron. And that's what this is all about. Whether you like or not, whether Lebron is trying his hardest or not, he is one of the best defenders in the league and deserving of all-defense selections. Why do you punish only Lebron for not going 100%? What about Kawhi and Giannis? What about these two, younger players, in their primes, guarding role players most of the time? Why do you only criticize Lebron for guarding role players *less often than these guys* and deny only him all-defense selections?  If Shaq was lazy but still the best player of all time, you would be wrong to deny he was the best player of all time just because his laziness puts you off. In that hypothetical scenario, he would still literally be the best player."
[Bill Simmons Ventures Into Interdimensional Vortex To Find Out If LeBron James Could Dominate In Different NBA Eras](https://sports.theonion.com/bill-simmons-ventures-into-interdimensional-vortex-to-f-1819576589)
"&gt;Steph Curry is one of the best iso players in the NBA, as well as the best off-ball  Yeah, wow he's so good he averages 23ppg during his peak years lol.    He's going to be 33 next year, he's not going to start scoring more, he's probably going to finish a top 30 ppg scorer on way less games played than anyone on the list.  He's not #2 PG all time, he's not even top 20 player all time.  Maybe you're his cousin or something.  &gt;oldheads like you claim that LeBron fucking James would get hacked off the floor in the 90s  Maybe you just started watching like 5 years ago.  Lebron is one of the worst floppers ever.    He would get clotheslined every time he went to the basket 30 years ago.    It took Jordan about 5+ years to be able to handle it and overcome.  Lebron's first 5 years in the league he would have been beat up, he was not nearly as jacked as he is now."
"Nope Isiah Thomas with the Pistons was better, Allen Iverson was a better all around scorer, and D'Wayne Wade is the best two way player under 6'5"" had it not been for injuries he would have 4 championships and had he not played the same years as 6'9"" 260lbs LeBron James he would have a league MVP"
"Uhh yes they do. Without the athletes, the NBA earns nothing. You can't just replace a  LeBron James with another person.  However in regular jobs, you can replace most people and continue work"
"Players in the 80s and 90s were overall less strong and athletic than current players. Defenses and defensive schemes were also much worse cause of illegal defense rules. IDK why you old timers have such a hard time grasping this concept.   And Steph Curry is one of the best iso players in the NBA, as well as the best off-ball, I don't see how you got confused about that. It's basically impossible to play Curry 1 on 1, cause he is the best shooter off the dribble in the league, as well as a great penetrator with some of the best handles ever. It's why you don't see teams TRYING to play him 1 on 1 and they attempt to guard him with double and triple teams on and off the ball. But I guess you probably thought that they do that cause they are ""soft"" lmao, not because it's the only way you can guard him.   I've seen oldheads like you claim that LeBron fucking James would get hacked off the floor in the 90s, never mind the fact that he is stronger and faster than 95% of the players who played back then lmao. Basketball players evolve and get better over time, it's time for you to move on friend."
We were going nowhere with that young core lmao. If your duo consists of Lebron James and another top 5 player you trade the young core every time
I'm from Montreal so I knew about him for a while. But the moment I knew he was going to be special is when in the bubble every team had to play their 8 games. This guy has defended against Lebron James in one game and did a good job and then in the next one defended Ja Morant. This kid could become the greatest perimeter defender in the league easily.
THATS BRONNY IN THE PICTURE???  Last time I saw him he was a skinny little guy! I know his dad is LeBron James but fuuuuuuuuck
"“Little Emperor” is Chinese slang for a spoiled kid who demands a lot of attention. LeBron was massively hyped and covered coming into the league, and that combined with his age and the King James/Emperor thing led people to draw that link."
"Since it's our two boys often being pitted against one another (Stockton vs. Isiah), it's going to be hard to avoid bias but I most certainly believe defining a player's greatness extends well beyond any single measure.   To answer some of your questions  &gt;Do you think John Stockton's career is overrated, underrated or appropriately rated?  Among randoms (like us here on Reddit), I think he's all three of those depending on the day and who's talking. Among more definitive lists (say, Bill Simmons' Pyramid), I don't have much of an objection (generally in the top 30 all-time range).   &gt;Do you consider a high peak to be relative to a players position or a high level of play at any spot?  Good question and I'm not sure if I have a definitive answer. Sometimes it feels like you just know when a player has ""it"" and the varying degrees of ""it"". I don't think I account for position as much as whether dude just has the juice and sees it converted into results to some degree (relative to what their team would have done without them there).   &gt;How important is durability and longevity for you when it comes to ranking players on an all-time list?  Another good question. I think my answer is that it's a factor but not the end all. It'll kind of depend upon how definitively incredible, awesome, and game-changing you are for how long. The extreme example would be watching LeBron James not only rack up All-NBAs over and over but that he's accomplishing amazing things the entire time. I think the steady-but-not-insane award winners don't benefit quite as much from a longevity point of view. Comes out feeling almost like ""they've been pretty darn good for a while now"" as opposed to legends doing insane, complete legend stuff.   &gt;How many point guards would you rank higher than Stockton in an all-time list?  Bias incoming. I don't have a number but if it came down to it and I was on the playground, I'd probably pick Isiah Thomas over him, if that adds a frame of reference. And that's kind of what makes this topic so complicated. Stockton was a better shooter, was likely less prone to turnovers (not looking at the stats at the moment but feels safe to presume), and did it for longer, but yet there was this element about Isiah—[particularly when the heat turned up in the postseason](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWv5aFyC0z2sBA6IuqUbCPbpDAyidJUHY)—that always made me feel like he was the dude I want running my team when a championship was on the line.   So I guess that brings it all back around. The idea of what's more important - the guy who's going to be an amazingly steady hand for nearly two decades or other factors - like a lesser shelf life but higher possibility of going berserk in the postseason and maybe making a run at a title while throwing the team on your back? I'd take either one - I'm not sure there's just one single way to be great."
LeBron James not making the 2009 or 2010 Finals saved his legacy.  If he made those Finals just to lose to Kobe and the Lakers he'd have little to no case for GOAT for losing to second-rate Jordan.
"those of use who actually watched the game could tell you that LeBron played significantly better when he wasn’t being guarded by Iggy in 2015  but since you wanted to throw around stats that don’t tel the whole story; let me add some of my own   &gt; When Iguodala was in the game, LeBron James shot 38.1 percent from the field, scoring 26 points per 36 minutes with 2.9 turnovers. With Iguodala on the bench, James shot 44 percent, averaging 35 points per 36 minutes with 2.2 turnovers"
I got in an argument here in Reddit once because some Americans were saying that LeBron James would be more recognizable by the average person (anywhere in the world) than Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. The Instagram numbers someone posted today are enough evidence...
Nets can get LEBRON James on that team and the Knicks will still sell every home game watching Julius Randle spinning 360
Maybe this sub can crowdfund the $200M to help out financially struggling LeBron James.
Absolutely. And it also eliminates the potential of “dumb money” as well. Imagine if you’re a team like Charlotte - wouldn’t you spend $90M of your $100M on LeBron James just for the star power and relevance?
"Lebron’s second lowest scoring playoff game of all time was game 4 that series and Lebron was constantly burned by Jason Terry. Jason terry, the guy coming off the bench at 34 years old who never once was an all star versus a prime Lebron James."
"Guess you didn't watch the series. LeBron and the Cavs actually asked the league to take a look at it and asked for a 2 game suspension, not 1:   &gt; In his postgame press conference, James all but dared the NBA to suspend Green.  “The league will take a look at it,” James said. “Obviously our locker room has seen it and we will see what they say.”  &gt; Think the NBA will suspend Green?  &gt; “No,” James said flatly.  &gt; The Warriors’ All-NBA forward avoided suspension in the Western Conference Finals after the NBA ruled — against popular opinion — his kick to Oklahoma City center Steven Adams’ groin was accidental. Green had his foul upgraded to a Flagrant 2 and is figured to be on thin ice.  &gt; If the NBA awards Green as much as a Flagrant 1 foul, he would be suspended for reaching the maximum four flagrant foul points allowed.  &gt; A few people in the organization accused James of playing politics. The thinking is that James, in a desperate attempt to save the Cavaliers’ season, is trying to use his pull to bait the NBA into taking out a key player.  &gt; “I guess they have to try something,” one source said."
"I love Lebron James, he’s a top 10 player of all time, but Shaq, Kobe, and Duncan somehow got jumped over by this dude who didn’t “own” them. It’s surprising to me that Lebron is put over them so easily without debate even though Duncan (prime and non prime) beat him twice in the finals (in Lebron’s prime)...it’s amazing how things could’ve been seen if Ray Allen doesn’t hit that incredible shot.   Again, no disrespect to Lebron (he plays for my team), but Shaq (last guy to win FMVP 3 straight times), Kobe (repeated and was some injures away from threepeating), and Duncan (1 shot away from being perfect in the finals) get easily looked over by Lebron. I feel due to Lebrons sudden jump in ranked lists, players like Bird, Magic, Kareem, Wilt, etc., are safe from arguments. It’s like Duncan, Kobe, and Shaq are stuck on numbers 10, 9, and 8 when you could argue them being top 5. It’s weird, I blame the media’s love for Lebron and their “want” of the MJ vs. “who’s next” argument."
"Lebron James is the most overrated player in the history of the game. I wouldn’t put him in my top 20 of all time. He has a terrible Finals record and is a negative influence on his teams. He doesn’t have the killer instinct of Jordan, Bird, Magic, Kobe and others."
"If you are going against a Lebron James led which you most likely have to do if you want to win a chip , individual defence is super important . He will just pick out the weakest defender and destroy him. The team's defence becomes as good as its weakest link. Against high IQ players individual defence is very important."
"Lakers still probably become champions with Lebron being around them. The lads are good, they would have just needed some veteran help and trust from James. They didn't get it, doesn't mean that they are not good enough."
Lebron james is the most obvious PED user in professional sports.
"&gt; Those two games would be the crowning achievement in **literally** anybody else’s career  His numbers were great, obviously. All time great? Not even close. So if the numbers aren't up near the 'greatest games ever played' then it must be the opponent? The 18 Celtics were possibly the weakest opponent he faced in the ECF in his career up to that date. Their best player was a rookie, their second best a sophomore. The others were Horford, Rozier and Baynes. That isn't a great team. So, if his opponent wasn't anywhere close to the toughest of all time then maybe it was an all time carry job? In both games his next best teammate scored 19 and 20 points respectively. In both games he had two other teammates score in double figures, so it's not like he was a one man team in either game. So what exactly makes you think those two games would be 'the crowning achievement of *literally anybody else's career*'. I'll point out the fact you said 'literally' and 'anybody else'. So you are saying that these two games would rank as the two best games of any other NBA player in history. You are suggesting it would be the crowning achievement of Jordan's, Wilt's, Magic's, Kobe's etc careers. Literally.             I don't even have to consult bbref to know that Jordan's game 6 vs Utah was significantly more impressive than either of these two games. It was a Finals game for a start. He only had one other teammate score in double figures (Kukoc with 15). His second best player was there simply as emotional support because he could barely walk. It was against two HOF players, two of the best ever at their respective positions, not some rookie and sophomores. *And* he hit the game winner which remains one of the most iconic shots in the history of the game. Yet here you are saying that both LeBron's games are literally better *and* that he has ten more games on his resume that are even better than those. So LeBron James, in your mind, has played, at least, the 12 greatest games ever. The hyperbole is through the roof...the fact 27 people have thought fit to upvote you says a lot about LeBron fans.....none of it good."
"The only reason LeBron James is successful in the NBA is because of his talents as an athlete.  As a basketball player, he has very limited amount of actual skills.  He has no offense game, and he’s a net negative as a playmaker.  Him driving to the basket using his athleticism and passing to the open man is a result of athletic talents not basketball skill.  His one true basketball skill that he has better compared to the average general population is 3 pt shooting.  As for defense, he was the 2nd worst defender in the playoffs for the Lakers this past championship run."
"The only player hyped as much as Lebron James was Lebron James so I'll take a Lebron James, thank you very much. Jesus.. such an easy question."
"Bruh they wore him down. It was a matter of when not if. He’s not LeBron, the dude averaged less than 20 ppg last season and he’s not nearly as gifted as a (primary) scorer. He got tired after putting up some excellent performances and I called it, he was gonna be gassed for game 6. And he was. It was visible.   Gassed Jimmy Butler in his first and deepest playoff performance as the primary scorer isn’t going to beat LeBron James and Anthony Davis in a 7 game series."
"It's these type of hot takes that come back to bite people in the ass every year lmao. Every year people come on here and say Westbrook is bad, Lebron is getting old, and Carmelo doesn't deserve a spot in the league...  Then every year they get proven wrong. Westbrook is still top 20 in the league he just needs to have the right fit that isn't next to James Harden.  Put Westbrook with some seven foot tall baller like Giannis/Embiid/Jokic/Gobert and he would have a mvp level season..."
Legit looks fake doesn't it?  Everyday I am grateful I exist in the same time as LeBron James.
Rondo literally talked about how they didn’t change their approach on guarding Jimmy until right before Game 6 [Rondo Defensive Scheme](https://lakersoutsiders.com/2020/10/27/lebron-james-rajon-rondo-jimmy-butler-nba-finals/)
"I was with you until  &gt;2018 Rockets would have beaten the 2020 Lakers  This is an unpopular opinion thread, not a joke thread. Can you really picture a scenario in which James Harden and Chris Paul beat LeBron James and Anthony Davis is a playoff series?"
I'm not talking about the 2020-2021 Warriors what does that have to do with this?   I'm saying that Harden can be compared to Curry even if a lot of people will pick Curry over him.  It isn't blasphemous to compare James to Steph is my entire point. There are things James does that Curry won't be able to do and vice versa of course.  It CAN be debated is my whole point. It's not like I'm saying Middleton is better than Lebron (no comparison at all ofc)
3 S tier brains w the skill sets of LeBron James. Yes sir
No matter how good or athletic your star is. One thing everyone should remember that a team needs a center unless you have a player either named Giannis Antetokounmpo or Lebron James.
He had two bad playoff series vs Dame Lillard and James Harden. If we want to have a real conversation about the number of bigs who won’t look shaky against those two in a playoff setting it’ll be a pretty short list and fans will get upset about the fact a lot of their favorite bigs(whom they view as good defenders) wouldn’t look good vs them.   None of this is even relevant either if NOP makes the playoffs and nobody will really care about the fact LeBron spent 4 games baptizing Brandon Ingram trying to guard him in round 1
My man. Just look at his BBREF stats. He has historically taken about 19-20 shots a game. His 3pt shot attempts has increased over the last 3 years leading to this past season being his most 3pt attempts versus any other season. Here’s his shot chart for easy viewing lol https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/lebron-james-career-shot-chart-by-season you’re wrong my dude.
LeBron James.
"Ok so you've decided to put some nuance into your take.  &gt; I'm not gonna knock Michael Jordan for losing to the bad boy pistons because they're a fucking legendary team.  That's fair.  &gt;  I'm gonna knock LeBron James for losing to the Mavs because they were 3 top 5 players at their positions in their primes.  Also fair.  With this in mind, you should realize that situations can change as you go through the playoffs.   For example in 2015, if the Cavs had all the injuries they had in the Finals, at the start of the playoffs, they most likely wouldn't have made it to the Finals. Should that be held against LeBron?  Or what about all the times when he gets to the Finals, but his team is immensely outclassed, like 2017/2018. Should those be held against him, or would it have been better for him to lose in an earlier round since his team wasn't feasibly winning against those Warrior teams?"
"James Harden has the best stamina of every NBA player ever, the amount of possessions he dominated and the amount of time he shoots, can ONLY be done by him. You can’t substitute Curry, KD, Dame, Lebron...etc into the Rockets system."
Lebron Raymone James
"If you cant make the finals that means your team just isnt good enough. Theres so many teams with first round exits and people just go ""well they just dont have the talent to compete with X team because X team has 3 all stars"" or some sort of argument like that. I'm not gonna knock Michael Jordan for losing to the bad boy pistons because they're a fucking legendary team. I'm gonna knock LeBron James for losing to the Mavs because they were 3 top 5 players at their positions in their primes."
"Where to start  Dirk is the most overrated players ever AD is not top 5 With no biases Top 3 SF: Larry, Lebron, and KD in that order With biases being mad at Celtics old titles and not Lakers old titles is stupid  James Harden will always be better as a Robin than a Batman"
Lebron James is a hardcore republican
"Sorry, not up for debate when there is literaly video evidence.  Lebron indeed steps over draymond.  Draymond then proceeds to [touch lebron james dick](https://mobile.twitter.com/krobphoto/status/741600118319747072).  Draymond was then rightfully suspended for his accumulation of flagrant fouls for touching too many dicks during the playoffs."
"James Harden is currently, and has been for the last several years, the second best player in the NBA after LeBron."
Does the spacing police actually believe that LeBron wouldn't make that team better? lmfaooo he's LeBron fucking James
The Cavs had Lebron James.
1.) LeBron James 2.) Giannis 3.) Luka 4.) Steph Curry 5.) Damian Lillard
"If you do not have Kyle Lowry or LeBron James on your team, you will literally have zero assists and no offensive system. Sorry, those are the rules."
Lebron James has to be in front of Lebron Kames if we’re talking greatest players.
"Lmfao no. LeBron James, James Harden, and Kawhi Leonard are all better. If Steph Curry returns to 2018-19 form, he’s also better. I think Luka Doncic might be similarly good but he’s only played at this level for one season so I’ll give Davis the benefit of the doubt"
"Oh no! You went two years between having a top 10 player all time, kobe bryant, and a top 2 players LeBron James. That must have been really hard.  “I’ve always known he’s shit.” “Have fun not winning a ring.” And you wonder why people are being aggressive toward you. This is like some teenage kid spitting on your shoes then being confused when someone kicks their ass. If winning comes not because of good management, patience and decision making but instead is your default setting, I’m glad you didn’t complain, because you have no right to. It’s probably pretty easy to feel ok about poor years when you know you’ll get better without needing to do anything, but again, the other 29 teams would really know how that feels."
That kid? Lebron James
The GOAT debate will never end. Watch 5 years from now when Luka explodes. People will start saying he's better than LeBron James.
"This is a hypothetical situation.   Let’s assume we’re taking Steve Nash at his best.   That would be 24 points with 11 assists with a 61% True Shooting (these are playoff numbers).   I don’t know what you’re talking about. That’s outstanding, and more than enough to deal with LeBron and those scrubs.   LeBron James is not winning a championship with Dellavedova Shumpert and Mozgov starting.  The moment Kyrie went down, the series was over. You people think a healthy team with 3 stars and good role players, is losing to a team without its second and third best player? Give me a fucking break."
Lebron James
"'Apathetic' or not, he was still very effective and had a great impact on defense. He led the league in [DRPM](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM) by such a significant margin that ESPN changed the formula mid-season just to lower Lebron's rating to match the narrative you are describing. And yet he still finished 3rd in the league in DRPM behind only Rudy Gobert and Daniel Theis.  He had a better defensive rating than almost all the other players who made the all-defense team. He had a better defensive rating than Kawhi, Pat Bev, Anthony Davis, Marcus Smart, Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons, and Bam Adebayo.  Only the Bucks all-defense players (Giannis, Brook Lopez, and Eric Bledsoe) had better defensive ratings than Lebron James. Bottom line is, when Lebron was on the court, his team performed markedly better on defense.  In terms of the eye test, he was very good. His only weakness was some missed rotations to the 3 point line to low % 3pt shooters. He closed out appropriately on the good shooters, was excellent in man to man defense, executed screen coverages correctly (didn't give up baskets because of miscommunication), and locked down the best players in crunch time."

"I genuinely wonder what people like Skip or going to do when LeBron retires. Over the last 15 years or so, a cottage industry within sports media has developed around hating on LeBron. Skip owes a lot of his rise within the industry solely to his LeBron James takes. He went from a relatively unknown sports writer and author to one of the biggest names in sports media because he was the original LeBron hater. What is Skip (and others like him) going to do when LeBron hangs it up in a couple of years?"
"Thing is Chuck doesn’t take himself seriously at all while Pierce’s outlandish takes seems to be coming from a place of vitriol. It doesn’t help that it’s against Lebron James, the 2nd best player of all time and quite loved on the sub"
"From my perspective, it's mostly his post-career comments that gets him so much ridicule, such as him having a better career than Wade, pioneering the step back jumper, and mostly him diminishing how great LeBron James is (which I think is the main thing this subreddit hangs onto).  It's gotten to the point where he's overhated- he was an exceptionally good player, a 10x all-star and definite Hall of Famer.  I posted this because I love Iso Joe lol"
Outside of his rookie year he almost never played without an MVP level guard by his side   Penny Hardaway averaged 21/5/7 next to shaq   Kobe   Dwade   Steve nash   Lebron james   Then ultimately the boston Big 3
Dwight Howard - 12.3 rebounds per game  LeBron James - 7.4 rebounds per game
"I believe LeBron couldn't give his #23 last year because Nike had already printed too many ""James 23"" fan jerseys for him to just change his number.  And with the sudden timeline of this season, I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same case again this year. Nike may already have started printing #23 jerseys for LeBron."
"I feel like in the Lebron era the voters really started to get into the whole analytics rage. Lebron isn’t going to stand out as much as he really should bc he takes plays off. Kobe’s era voted much more on reputation and that led to a lot of the same guys being picked every year. I absolutely agree, James should’ve been on more defensive teams. Total game-changer."
Their talent has never been questioned.  They just weren't there in the right context.  They will succeed in another context that will turn out to be the right one.  The Lakers had the need to win quickly when they signed LeBron James.  They couldn't afford to wait.
"&gt;No they could not. Love can't even sniff the playoffs alone even in the East. The only reason Irving has is because he's been on teams that are playoff teams without him (Boston and Brooklyn). Kyrie and Love couldn't even be .500 when Lebron sat they have a 20% win rate together without James.   &gt;   &gt;It's easy to write off Love and Irving compared to Paul because the former bleed points on defense whereas Paul does not.  Literally gave you their stats for those playoffs and you still cant get over it lol. They also add more offensively scoring wise than Cp3 does. Lol. That's also bullshit that Kyrie and Love coulndt get into the playoffs in the east. Total horseshit. Lebron has from 2014-2017 has missed 9% of the games played LOL. That's it. That is incredibly LOW sample size to judge off of the course of three seasons. And its a BS argument. Kyrie and Love absolutely could make the playoffs in the East.   No it's not. Like I said Cp3 cannot provide the volume scoring both of them COMBINED can provide.   &gt;No, you are full of shit. Any improvement they made doesn't compare to the Warriors adding Kevin Durant wtf.   &gt;   &gt;That's your opinion. I'm certain this Lakers team would be competitive with the Kd Warriors and I am of the opinion they would win. I am basing that off of how close Harden + Paul came and how good Lebron + Ad are that people keep asking if they're a superteam. What makes you think Harden + CP3 is better than Lebron + Ad? Unless you're admitting CP3 is even better than you're suggesting.  No you are just dick riding Lebron. They literally had a better playoff record. Love and Irving both played better and the Cavs  3 points shooting was literally one of the best the NBA has ever seen. And Im not comparing their improvement to the KD Warriors, Im saying they were similarly talented when compared to the 2017-2018 Rockets.   Yea, I never said it wasnt my opinion. Okay fine, you talked me into it, Lakers get beat in 6  :P.  But for what its worth Zach Lowe also seems to think the 2017 Warriors also cream that Lakers team in 5. That team outside of Lebron and AD isnt that good. KCP, Caruso and Rondo...that's it. And they are shitty shooters outside of KCP. Ariza, Capela, Gordon and Tucker(and Luc) are all better role players. You have literally no one on that team who can guard Harden and good fucking luck double teaming him with Cp3 on the team.And there is also no Guarantee that AD ever has a playoff performance like he did in the bubble ever again. He will likely never shoot that well again. 2017-2018 Rockets I think would also beat the Lakers."
"&gt; Irving and Love in the East? Are you kidding me? They absolutely could do that.  No they could not. Love can't even sniff the playoffs alone even in the East. The only reason Irving has is because he's been on teams that are playoff teams without him (Boston and Brooklyn). Kyrie and Love couldn't even be .500 when Lebron sat they have a 20% win rate together without James.   It's easy to write off Love and Irving compared to Paul because the former bleed points on defense whereas Paul does not.  &gt;They were absoltuely playing better even if they didnt get that many new roster additions.   No, you are full of shit. Any improvement they made doesn't compare to the Warriors adding Kevin Durant wtf.  That's your opinion. I'm certain this Lakers team would be competitive with the Kd Warriors and I am of the opinion they would win. I am basing that off of how close Harden + Paul came and how good Lebron + Ad are that people keep asking if they're a superteam. What makes you think Harden + CP3 is better than Lebron + Ad? Unless you're admitting CP3 is even better than you're suggesting."
"&gt;James Harden has won 0 games against the Warriors without Chris Paul. Fact.  Harden has had more sucess against the KD Warriors than Lebron has, fact. Lebron couldn't take more than a game off of them with two other all stars, fact.   &gt;This is NOT a fact this is a hypothetical. And there is nothing to support it. Harden had his chance with CP3 against the KD less Warriors and still lost. Another fact.  What are you talking about? We lost Game 7 by 9 Points, you dont think Cp3 would have made a difference? Cmon bro, see reality. See using the very next year is a bad argument. Seeing as how we lost our two great wing players and did not replace them and Chris Paul had gotten worse. Not the same Rockets team, not the same Chris Paul. And also IT WAS ONE GAME. You wanna restart that series and see how far it goes without KD, be my guest.   &gt; I literally do accept that how many times do I have to say so? I'm literally saying Lebron didn't play well enough like his normal standards. James Harden never plays up to his normal standards in the playoffs. Fact.    &gt;   &gt;Lebron James is better than James Harden. Fact.   &gt;   &gt;All these FACTS, lend themselves to Lebron + CP3 doing better against the Kd Warriors than Harden + CP3. This is a conclusion based on facts.  No, you tried to make an excuse for his shitty shooting. He just underperformed. That is also a factually incorrect statement you made about Harden. You should check his numbers and his advanced numbers these last three playoffs. So no, that is not a fact.  Yea, I never said otherwise.   You arent giving facts, you are giving bullshit narratives around these facts. And trying to make silly hypotheticals.  The fact is both Lebron and Harden had similarly talented teams going agasint the KD Warriors and Lebron had much less success than Harden agaisnt them. That is the FACT."
"&gt;Chris Paul can carry a team to the playoffs by himself. Irving and Love can't they might be all-star caliber players but Chris Paul is an all-nba franchise type of player. Further, Kevin Love is a net negative against the best teams (especially the Warriors) and Kyrie often is too. In Game 3 2017 Lebron was a +7 in the loss to GSW while Kyrie was a -9 and Love was a -11.   &gt;   &gt;The 2017 Cavs were the pretty much the same as the 2016 Cavs who of note was added? Kyle Korver? That's no comparison to the Warriors adding Kd.  Irving and Love in the East? Are you kidding me? They absolutely could do that. Give me a break.  Like I sad, there is no significant gap between Irving AND  Love and Chris Paul. Using a one game plus minus is a very bad way of representing your argument.  Kyrie Irving, 27 PPG on 57 TS%. Kevin Love 19 PPG on 60 TS%. The very next year they won the championship they lost a total of 1 game against any non Warrior team in the playoffs. Their shooting was one of the best in NBA history. They were absoltuely playing better even if they didnt get that many new roster additions. Please stop trying to bullshit for Lebron. Irving and Love(TOGETHER) isnt not significant up grade or downgrade against 2017-2018 Cp3 by himself.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;This is all hypotheticals, but if Lebron James is better than James Harden, then it stands to reason he would do better against the Warriors with Chris Paul than James Harden did.   &gt;   &gt;Chris Paul is closer to Ad as an impact player than Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love combined. This is important because Lebron wanted to trade for Ad at the trade deadline in 2019 and go beat the Warriors and win the championship. That was his plan. So Lebron at least believes he could beat the KD Warriors with Ad. You could argue Ad is better than CP3 of course, but I would say CP3 is in Ad's class.  Well yea probably, but that's a hypothetical.  The FACT  is he couldnt even take more than ONE GAME off the Durant Warriors with Irving and Love(two other all star level players) and needed an all time shooting performance from 3 to even take one. He had similar help, he coulndt get it done.   Chris Paul shot a like a 52 TS% against the Warriors in the series we went to 7, I love the guy and I think he is def better than Love and Irving(combined) but the fact is the talent gap between a top 10  player and two top 20 players isnt so significant to where you can just write off the performance of each teams. Neither the Cleveland roster nor the 2017-2018 Rockets roster had such a significant gap in talent. The fact is, Harden has had way more success against the KD Warriors than Lebron, that is a fact. Lebron is a better player though, that is also a fact.    All this stuff about AD is added fluff that isnt needed. And no that Lakers team this year nor last year is beating the Warriors with KD, not happening at all. They lose in 5 last year and lose in 6 this year."
"James Harden has won 0 games against the Warriors without Chris Paul. Fact.  &gt; Harden took three off them and would have beaten them WITH Chris Paul.  This is NOT a fact this is a hypothetical. And there is nothing to support it. Harden had his chance with CP3 against the KD less Warriors and still lost. Another fact.   &gt;And if 2019 Harden would have played in 2018 against GS, he would have won. See how stupid this is? Lebron didnt perform well, the end. Accept that.  I literally do accept that how many times do I have to say so? I'm literally saying Lebron didn't play well enough like his normal standards. James Harden never plays up to his normal standards in the playoffs. Fact.   Lebron James is better than James Harden. Fact.  All these FACTS, lend themselves to Lebron + CP3 doing better against the Kd Warriors than Harden + CP3. This is a conclusion based on facts."
I think at Kobe's position he was top 2 or 3 most of the time. Meanwhile Lebron James has way too many competition in his position.
"Chris Paul can carry a team to the playoffs by himself. Irving and Love can't they might be all-star caliber players but Chris Paul is an all-nba franchise type of player.

This is all hypotheticals, but if Lebron James is better than James Harden, then it stands to reason he would do better against the Warriors with Chris Paul than James Harden did.  Chris Paul is closer to Ad as an impact player than Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love combined. This is important because that Lebron wanted to trade for Ad at the trade deadline in 2019 and go beat the Warriors and win the championship. That was his plan. So Lebron at least believes he could beat the KD Warriors with Ad. You could argue Ad is better than CP3 of course, but I would say CP3 is in Ad's class."
"He certainly worth mentioning. Playing on the same team as Embiid hurts his chances of being seriously considered. LeBron James himself said Ben could be better than him. Simmons bball IQ, and athletic gifts alone put him in a special category. As his complete game comes together (free throw/jump shooting) skys the limit. Don't forget The Greek Freak this year just developed an outside shot and won MVP last year."
Steph Curry  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Anthony Davis
"No order, this seaon:  Lebron James Kawai Leonard Anthony Davis Greek Freak Jimmy butler Brandon Ingram   Side note: I dont think KD should qualify until we see his return from injury. He could turn out like PG...or he could turn out like TMac..."
"If this came from someone else, then hed probably get roasted as 90% of the ""fans"" are ""experts"". Jerry West is a genius of the game. Thank you for sharing the same view as the true fans that really know the game of basketball. For me personally, ive never seen anyone like this dude. Closest was lebron james and mj in terms of greatness potential and overall basketball skills. This dude luka at this point, hes better than lebron during his sophomore. Hes probably the most complete player ive ever witnessed. No other names in their category and theres a good chance luka will sit on top of the throne when it's all said and done. Theres a good chance, hope he stays healthy."

"2010s had SEVEN different winners: Lakers, Mavericks, Heat 2x, Spurs, Warriors 3x, Cavaliers, and Raptors 1990s had FOUR different winners: Pistons, Bulls 6x, Rockets 2x, Spurs  So parity wise the 2010s wins.  Now competition wise I would say it’s tougher to make the NBA nowadays than back then. The talent pool today is much deeper because their hasn’t been an expansion team since 2003 and the fact that foreigners are coming in and not only rivaling but even surpassing American players.  Better players is debatable but I would say today’s players as a whole are most versatile. You got big men who could shoot 3s, dribble and lead fast breaks like guards and can guard 1-5 effectively.   Name a 90s player similar to LeBron James or Kevin Durant or hell even Giannis Antetokounmpo. These guys would of been seen as aliens back then.   Reggie Miller was considered the premier shooter of his time but in today’s era he would of been a dime of dozen. There’s a handful of dudes that could shoot as well if not better than him with insane volume and accuracy and even shot making difficulty."

What the fuck does it take for the NBA to test the person they've needed to test monthly since he entered the league...     They're always testing this dude's teammates.  Just test Lebron James already please?  It was sooooo obvious to anybody who has ever been around PED's that he was on them at the end of Cleveland/the summer before he went to Miami and throughout Miami.     Now he's on the new shit.  The new PED's that don't bulk you up but lean you out while still giving you the same strength/quickness lol...man's body has grown and shrunk so much but he doesn't get tested?  Ha.
Butler makes everyone him around him better than any other forward in the game not named Lebron James  there's a reason his RAPTOR is so much higher than Siakam's
"Weird that because of his appearance...some people didn't respect his game at first.  You see guys do ferocious dunks on fast breaks etc., but the majority of the NBA doesn't want it like Caruso does.  This guy plays the right way...hell...Lebron James (in his prime prime) didn't even play as aggressive as Caruso does now.  This dude is a fucking baller.  He goes as hard to the rack as anybody in the game rn."
"How is it they pick these awards on a weekly basis? It makes no sense to me. To date just as a point of reference, Out of the 11 weeks that have passed thus far this season, Giannis has 3 of these awards, Lebron has 2, and the other three MVP favorites in Harden, Davis, and Doncic have 2, 2, and 1 award respectfully. I understand the guys in the West not outright dominating their competition, because literally all the best players in the NBA are on that side. But Giannis is in a land of his own. Has there been any week in this entire season thus far where he wasn't been the best player on the court in the Eastern Conference? Not Lowry, not Dinwiddie, not Vuceivic, guys who've all won the award this season. How do they decide when to give it to the MVP favorites, and when to give it to players playing above expectations like Melo or Bam? Because it's not like the MVP guys take off weeks. Especially a James Harden whose basically averaging 40 a game. I don't get it."

"did some googling. Klutch broke the news themselves.

And Mark Jackson was on broadcast just last week saying 'that used to be a dunk for LeBron James' when he scored a layup as if he's lost his hops.
"His athleticism is more impressive than say Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Kevin Garnett, Derrick Rose, James Harden, Shaquille O'Neal, Vince Carter, and a bunch others?  You can argue a few of those, but the fact that he isnt clear top 5 at all does not help his case.  And just looking at athleticism is kinda pointless. Jeremy Lin was exceptionally talented atheltically but it never came to fruition outside of a season or two.  Blake was talented but it never manifested anywhere and he only has a single season basically as a point forward.  I just dont think you are considering a lot of the decade here and how talented the players that have come through the NBA in that time"

"Do you not understand context or nuance? He's getting less touches than he was when playing with *LeBron James* &amp; *Kyrie Irving*. On this roster he should be the focal point of the offense, but he's not. Sexton has the highest usage rate, and that should under no circumstance be happening if you want to play winning basketball. To even try to argue against this is mindbogglingly delusional nonsense."

Shit. Russell Westbrook blows KD completely out of the water here. He dominates everyone not named LeBron in just about every single category. Aside from his abysmal TS%, Russ finishes: 2nd in PER, 1st in OREB%, 2nd best in TRB%, 1st in AST%(by FAR), 1st in STL%, 1st in USG%, 2nd in WS/48, 1st in OBPM, 2nd in DBPM, 2nd in BPM, and 2nd in VORP. In almost EVERY category, Russ is either 1st, or 2nd behind LeBron James. Nobody else even comes close to him in the advanced stats department. Pretty impressive for someone who only pads counting stats at the expense of his team.  &gt;Meanwhile, KD finished: last in PER, 2nd last in TS%, last in ORB%, 3rd in TRB%, last in AST%, last in STL%, tied for 2nd for USG%, last in WS/48, last in OBPM,  2nd last in DBPM, last in BPM, and last in VORP. Hmmm, not what I expected from someone who carried Russ every year. Abysmal showing from KD here.  &gt;So not only was Russ clearly better than KD in terms of counting stats, but he also dominated KD (and everyone else) when looking at their advanced metrics. But of course, stats don't tell the whole story. Let's take a deeper look at each series that year and how both of them performed.  How does this mainly use BPM?"
Please explain to me how *LeBron James* has an unorthodox play style or isn't an analytics darling?
"Cj was clearly the better playing in each of the following series, cause dame was crap. One good series and you think dame is hot, again show me his mvp, his leading the league in scoring and in assists tell me when he is one of three players with 19000 points 6000 rebounds and assists with Oscar Roberson and Lebron James. Because dame will never do anything that impressive let alone win a MVP."
If KD has two cheap rings then Steph has three cheap rings. Steph’s only ring without KD was won against Matthew Delladova and Lebron James.
"Not this season. KP needs one more season to get his legs back to what they were. I watched almost every Knicks game when he was playing in NY and I can see he is still isn't 100% confident.  I believe that's why Carlisle has him out on the perimeter more and not so much in the paint.  I believe next season we will see a dominant KP and an even better Luka. If THJ keeps up his shooting clip the Mavs will be great offensively. I would say they need a bit more defense as they have to contend against Kawhi, PG, AD and LeBron. They are all difficult coverages as well as Jokic.  But man these Mavs have been fun af to watch. Dallas fans are so fortunate. I am an envious Knicks fan. god damn I hate James Dolan and Steve Mills so much."
"Lebron's teams were underdogs in 7 of 9 of those finals. The media would like you to believe the Heat was a super team, but that team will never be viewed as a historically great team.   The Showtime Lakers, Russell Celtics, Bird Celtics, 90's Bulls, the Warriors are true super teams (all had several Hall of Famer/historically great players). Lebron has NEVER played on a super team, as a matter of fact this Lakers team is the best team he's ever played for and I've watched every second of every game &amp; all Lakers fans will tell you that this team turns to complete and utter DOG SHIT as soon as he sits down to rest.  Compare apples to apples, put Lebron on those 90's Bulls teams &amp; take MJ off - those Bulls teams would've won at least 8 rings with Lebron. Those teams had one very subtle weakness and he fixes that (passing). Now go look at the teams he had to go through in his 9 finals appearances. The talent gap between the teams that LBJ went against vs the teams MJ went against is astronomical!  While I'm at it lets put the Kobe debate to rest:  *Player A* career averages: 27.4ppg, 7.2rpg, 7.4apg, 1.6spg, 0.8bpg, 50.4 FG%, 34.5 3FG%, 73.8 FT%, 3.5 TOs  *Player B* career averages: 25ppg, 5.2rpg, 4.7apg, 1.4spg, 0.5bpg, 44.7 FG%, 32.9 3FG%, 83.7 FT%, 3 TOs  Player A is Lebron, Player B is Kobe.   Kobe wasn't even the best player on his own team during the first 3 championships that the Lakers won, he's an all-time great but to say he's in the GOAT conversation and better than Lebron James is just comical. You can check head to head stats - Lebron was 16-6 vs Kobe and had higher numbers in every statistical category."

"It doesn’t matter if it’s a guy someone likes and matters if it’s a guy someone doesn’t like.   For example, Jackie Mac didn’t vote or LeBron on All-NBA last year because he caused team drama but voted Kyrie for second team All-NBA.   James Harden missed out on All-NBA a few years ago because of team success but Kemba made it last year."
"Kawhi can't carry a bad team, that's not his game. Lebron, CP3, and James Harden are the only ones who could do that."
"""Fit in or fit out.""  - LeBron James"
"In what world does a career high of 9.7 points per game on 46 TS%, playing at the most efficient position, warrant a 15/50? He almost has as many turnovers as unassisted field goals and wasn't a lob threat, and couldn't make layups. Pretty much all of his unassisted field goals came from putback dunks. I'm struggling to think of a center you can legitimately say is worse than Wallace on offense. He also has a bottom 5 FT% ever.     Warriors always had a legit rim protector in Draymond, also had Bogut. Lakers are an okay example, though Bynum and Gasol were a pretty goddamn good defensive center lineup (both were rim protectors, just B-tier.) Cavs is true. Heat had Bosh who was always a decent rim protector, just a bad post defender. So in the last 30 years, the teams without good rim protectors that have won championships had one of: Michael Jordan, Lebron James.   Also side note either I've lost it or your math is off, 40 + 5 + 5 = 50 not 35. And a system that rates Enes Kanter as a 35 and Ben Wallace as a 40 is a very flawed system."
"A team with Love, JR Smith, George Hill, Tristan Thompson, Korver was never going to be competitive based on the lack of a star to carry them.  SGA wouldnt work out with us and we had the 8th pick.  We had no cap space, not that anyone would sign with us post lebron.   On top we started 0-6 and fired Lue because im pretty sure the FO came to their senses and realized all these clowns rode on the jock of King James to the glory land."
"Overrated: LeBron James.   This coming from someone that thinks he’s the GOAT, I just think he’s way past his physical prime, and is going to struggle to score in the playoffs when his shot isn’t falling.   Amazing player still, just not the best player in the league like many people think.   Best player for me is either Giannis or Harden."
"This is a team that LeBron ^$%@%# James left in free agency TWICE, and he's a local boy. Pretty sure Love knows what this franchise is all about."
The luckiest thing to ever happen to Dan Gilbert was drafting LeBron James. He'd have had zero basketball success otherwise.
"After the Heat managed to squeak out the 8th seed, they added LeBron James and Chris Bosh. It worked pretty well.  The Warriors added Andre Iguodala as a max guy to a scrappy overachieving team (went from one of the worst in the league to having a good playoff series the year before). Worked out nicely.  These Clippers are currently 25-12. They went 48-34 last year. They're winning 9% more games so far this year. It's working terrifically.  It usually works out. Pretty much the only recent example that absolutely did not work out was Dwight/Nash Lakers, and that was largely because Nash's leg stopped being a leg. The times where things don't go smoothly are just more memorable."
Kyrie Irvin dinning with LeBron James and saw a Phone call from Kevin Love. “ I wonder what does he want “
"I don't get the whole ""bro you signed the contact"" argument.   1. The Cleveland Cavaliers have been exceptionally sub par as an organization and their only saving grace is that Lebron James was born in Akron, Ohio.   2. Love got offered an immense contract that no one would turn down.  3. It's not on Love's shoulders to field a competitive team, or even a team with competent players. Cleveland is full of mismatched players and really doesn't have anything promising going for them. Garland and Sexton aren't a great fit next to one another, and they really don't have anything going for them. Maybe Porter Jr?   tl;dr FREE LOVE."

Kevin Love gave LeBron James depression
"&gt; CLEVELAND — Kevin Love had an emotional verbal outburst directed toward general manager Koby Altman following shootaround on Saturday, expressing his displeasure and disgust with the organization, league sources told The Athletic.  &gt;Love was screaming in front of teammates and Cavs coaches and front-office members that there was “no feel here,” league sources said.  &gt;It was not immediately clear if Love would be in the lineup for the Cavs Saturday game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, although he is expected to play.  &gt;Love was fined $1,000 by the Cavs for an outburst on the bench on Dec. 31 in Toronto, sources said, and disagreed with the fine. He was spotted by cameras slapping chairs on the Cavaliers bench away from the team huddle in the third quarter of the blowout. He asked a Cavs coach to take him out of the game so he could cool down. During the next timeout, when a coach asked what was wrong, Love said he didn’t like how selfish the first unit was playing, sources said.  &gt;Saturday’s exchange between Love and Altman was not the first. At the end of last season, Love raised his voice toward the general manager and Altman threatened to fine him. Sources said they heard Love say, “Go ahead. I have plenty of money.”  &gt;It was Altman who signed Love to a four-year, $120 million extension in the summer of 2018, just after LeBron James left as a free agent. But at the time of the signing, the front office, including Altman, told Love the franchise intended to try to compete for the playoffs, rather than rebuild. And what has transpired has been two seasons of just that — a total rebuild in the wake of the LeBron era.  &gt;Love has preferred a trade out of Cleveland, and teammates and coaches watched him express his feelings on the bench last week.  &gt;Love would prefer a trade to a contender, sources said, though he has not publicly asked for one."

"&gt; . If the team was that horrid besides James, then why did they win 60+ games more than once.  Lebron James"
"Actually Rondo was hurt at the beginning of the season. When he finally started playing he was surprisingly on fire from 3-pt range (although it was on typically low volume). It turns out Rondo is not a 50-60% 3-pt threat, however, and now that his shooting has regressed to the mean, all his other deficiencies (namely his poor defense) are not being papered over by good off-ball shooting. So instead he's like the anti-3&amp;D player, who also isn't quick enough to beat players off the dribble ([even when he gets the switch on bigs](https://theathletic.com/1478503/2019/12/23/rajon-rondo-cant-give-the-lakers-what-they-need-in-lebron-james-absence/)), and on top of that he hasn't been anywhere near as good as he used to be at running an offense."
"&gt; It’s even worse when you remember how Lebron sells himself as a champion of civil rights, yet, when the issue gets in the way of him making money, he’s more than willing to throw people under the bus. Champion of civil rights, but only when it’s convenient for him financially.  This is such a stupid argument.  So because LeBron actually cares about domestic civil rights, while James harden cares mostly about domestic strip clubs, that somehow makes LeBron's stance on China worse...?"
"Back in 2007, I remember when LeBron James [refused](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/16/sports/basketball/16cavaliers.html?module=inline&amp;mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=1E416AAEF14A361AD7C62CA2E7D2DEBA&amp;gwt=pay&amp;assetType=REGIWALL) to sign a letter circulated by his teammate Ira Newble who criticized the Chinese government for its support of the Sudanese government in relation to the armed conflict in Darfur, in which hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed.  But the next year, in 2008, James spoke out about Darfur on ESPN:  “At the end of the day we’re talking about human rights. And people should understand that human rights and people’s lives are in jeopardy. We’re not talking about contracts here. We’re not talking about money. We’re talking about people’s lives being lost....""  https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=3398947"
"this is an argument about what consitutes 'bad play'. while i didn't directly define what i meant, i meant it more in reference to production. From an objective standpoint, comparing their on court production just gives more credence to ingram.   I agree he came in raw, but him being in the league for less time than brown and having been on a worse team (we already agreed his role was more difficult) i think is a fair reason for poor splits. Kid was 18 trying to learn to be a #1 option in Los Angeles with a bunch of other rookie players. Of course the numbers won't be perfect, of course he isn't lebron james.   That being said, if brown were asked to do anything ingram has been asked to do night in night out his production would be considerably worse. i can almost guarantee it.   While you may be right in terms of a efficiency standpoint when looking at ingrams early years, you are also ignoring how much he has grown from year to year, and while brown is showing a decent 3 point shot recently, he just isn't the offensive weapon ingram is or could be. As well you seem to miss how much easier it is to score as a 3rd option vs the 1st. the defense is never as keyed in on brown as it is on ingram, just never will be.   Defensively there isn't much to argue, brown is just better and has been better on that end of the floor. Ingram has put together stretches of good defense, but brown consistently plays elite level wing defense and i have to give him that one."
Magic Johnson + Karl Malone = LeBron James
"Couple things.   I never said or implied ""magic."" I gave it as one of a number of reasons that you might consider Marcus Smart to be tough, which I frankly don't think is a very controversial position.   Once again, you mention acting like a tough guy without physical repercussions. There are no physical repercussions of the sort you seem to be mentioning in the NBA at all today! Pushing at shoving is the most. Out of all potential physical repercussions, Smart faces the most by physically tangling with much much larger players in the post and down low. Smart takes as much physical punishment as nearly anyone in the NBA.   You mention being a diva, which I think is a phrase I understand differently. To me, being a diva would be thought of as more expecting special treatment for being a star, which I would associate more with players like Chris Paul or Lebron James (just trying to think of examples, both of those guys are excellent).   Without a definition offered, cheap antics and instigating drama are essentially defined as ""players I don't like doing things I don't like."" Is it ""instigating drama"" or ""old school"" to talk trash or otherwise try and disrespect your opponent? Is it ""cheap antics"" to step over an opponent or is it ""old school"" (talking generally here). Without being specific, a lot of this is just ""Marcus Smart is a player I don't like."" Which, fine I guess?"
"This one has some truth . Bron kept passively aggressively taking shots at K Love and his teammates in social media while acting completely different in person. To the point the Cavs tod Bron to stop it and he got a lil attitude about it    https://sports.yahoo.com/kevin-love-calls-lebron-james-160001095.html   I** didn’t plan to go here, but the whole fit in/fit out thing from your first year with LeBron. Was he right?**  I think on one end it was extremely passive-aggressive and silly. But at the same time, I feel like I did have to find my way and fit in. But it wasn’t an easy process for me. I think right now if that happened — it wouldn’t because I believe who I am now and the growth I’ve had — but I truly believe that you have to understand. That’s why I never make assumptions. We’ve talked before about “[The Four Agreements](https://www.miguelruiz.com/the-four-agreements),” right? Never make assumptions, never take anything personally. Well, obviously I took that personally. I wish I could’ve handed them that book and been like, “Listen, you’ve got to understand what it was like to be the main focus, 20 shots a night, be ‘the guy.’”    My star dimmed a little bit to have to sacrifice. So at least just acknowledge it. All I wanted was a little bit of love. All I wanted was (a pat on the back, an arm around the shoulder). I never got that. I think I just wanted a little bit of love. Not even notoriety, just an acknowledgment of, “Hey, listen, we know that you’re sacrificing.” That was not there the first year.    I think Champ (James Jones) helped me to understand, “Listen, just be yourself and everything else will fall into place.” But to really fully get there, it took me a year and some change."
"True but he didn't just say ""Harden is a great scorer""  He said he's the most unstoppable player in the league right now. Not Lebron, or Giannis, or Kawhi. James Harden."
"&gt; For the shortest time  It should be for a short time.  He made one comment, then hasn't said a single word on the subject since.  The comment he did make wasn't even anti Hong Kong democracy, but about why it was a bad idea for Morey to insert himself into the conflict while NBA teams were headed to China.  Why does it need to be continuously brought up forever like he picked up a rifle and shot a protester?  The Hong Kong protests are not about Lebron James."
How overrated is him? He is a star that is consistently rated top 20. Not his fault for couldn't beat Lebron James in the playoffs.
"Devin Booker can’t play both SG and SF either he’s only 6’5 with average defense at best . Don’t cite bleacher report bruv..  Try basketball reference   Klay is a wing (SG/SF), Jarrett Culver is a wing, Jaylen Brown is a wing  Devin Booker is a guard (SG/PG), James Harden a guard, Jrue Holiday a guard. Tyler Herro a guard  It’s not that complicated, those guys are not as position-less like LeBron, or Luka or Justise Winslow"
"1) James Harden   or   Pascal Siakam and Kemba Walker  2) Anthony Davis   or   Jimmy Butler and Jrue Holiday  3) Paul George or   Chris Paul and Danilo Gallinari   4) Joel Embiid or   Sabonis and Victor Oladipo, no you can’t ignore health for this factor it in accordingly however you feel  5) Dame Lillard or   Ben Simmons and Khris Middleton  Edit some more   6) Kyrie Irving or   Eric Bledsoe and Al Horford   7) Rudy Gobert or   Lou Williams and Tobias Harris   8) Kawhi Leonard or   Jokic and Kyle Lowry   9) LeBron or   Kemba Walker and Joel Embiid(initially has it KAT and Siakam if you want to do that one)  10) Giannis or   KAT and Kyrie Irving"
"I keep saying this, he is an All Star level center. But the ASG only does frontcourt and backcourt for some reason. They eliminated the center position years ago for no reason at all and now he has to compete with the likes of LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard. He will never put up the numbers necessary to get in the ASG over not only these players but players that are not nearly as good at their positions than he is at his.   There is no reason the ASG can't be voted by actual positions. Point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center. Either vote them in at the position they play most of the time, or their officially listed position by their team. It's not nearly as complicated as people make it out to be.   It's a travesty that he and Adams will basically never have a shot at being recognized as one of the best at their position, and doing the things that their position does."
I was in China and saw LeBron James. Was really cool
"This is what I was trying to say so thank you for elucidating. KG is a top 5 all time defender and I'd rather have that on a team with other options than a slightly above average efficiency iso scorer.    People need to stop pretending Kobe was out here putting up James Harden numbers in isolation. He was good, but calling him a top 5 scorer is insane. He didn't get buckets in a way that helped his whole team like Shaq, Jordan, KAJ, Lebron, Harden, KD, Curry, or Bird."
"This seems like a fun exercise. I'll take a stab at it.  Point Guard.  **(1) Stephen Curry** - He's #1 for now but the last time he balled out as his team's undisputed #1 was four years ago. If he doesn't come back strong, then then his position at the top starts to become contentious.  **(2) Russell Westbrook** - Top 3 playmaker in the league, crazy at pushing the pace, one of the best rebounders in the league, elite kick and drive game, has a history of going off for 40+ points  **(3) CP3** - Has shown he can still deliver if he plays in a team geared to his strengths. However, is injury prone and has lost a step.  **(4) Damian Lillard** - Is the most proven of all the other score-first guards in the league so he's fourth by default.  **(5) Kemba Walker** - Less flashier than Kyrie but is more of a team player and provides more effort on D  **(6) Trae Young** - Only reason I'm not putting him in the top 5 is because the Hawks have been absolute trash. Potentially the greatest offensive guy in this list.  **(7) Kyle Lowry** - Is a reliable floor general who's just all-around good at everything. Doesn't get the respect he deserves tbh.  **(8) Kyrie Irving** - He really showed his limitations on the Celtics last year. He's entertaining as fuck but isn't a great playmaker or a consistent elite scorer yet. I need to see more from him.  **(9) Ben Simmons** - He's fantastic at everything but shooting. Unfortunately, he's the 5th scoring option when everyone's healthy so his opportunities to demonstrate what he can fully do as a top is limited  **(10) Malcom Brogdon** - Is emerging as a top notch floor general too. Great length and can't wait to see him alongside Dipo  Shooting Guard.  **(1) James Harden** - He's a one-man-offence. Pass him the ball and stand on the perimeter is a legit winning strategy. 38ppg is absurd.  **(2) Klay Thompson** - Elite shooter. Top notch defender. Doesn't need to handle the ball. Would start for literally every franchise in the league.  **(3) Luka Doncic** - It's weird. I think he's a better player than Klay but not a better SG lol. His NBA career has gotten off to a great start but his impact against elite teams takes a severe dip and I don't know how he'd perform in the playoffs.   **(4) Devin Booker** - Is in the loaded Western Conference where most of the best guards play so gets a lot of disrespect. However if you use your eyes, it's obvious that he's a supremely talented fella.  **(5) Donovan Mitchell** - His solid defence makes up for the usual efficiency complaints. Has shown an increased playmaking capacity in Conley's absence.  **(6) Bradley Beal** - Considering he's in his 8th season, I don't think he's done enough to be in the top 5. I don't really see why he's a lot of people's #2 either.  **(7) Victor Oladipo** - If he returns to his pre-injury form, then he's basically a top 5 staple. A ball-handling bucket getter who plays great defence.  **(8) Jrue Holiday** - Watching Jrue clamp up a great guard is one of the most exhilarating things in the NBA. He's also good for 20ppg.  **(9) Zach Lavine** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(10) Demar Derozan** - Is the gatekeeper for a top 10 SG imo. Has shown he can handle being a #1 guy but isn't clutch and hasn't developed his 3pt game since leaving Toronto.  Small Forward  **(1) Lebron James** - Kawhi coasts too much in the regular season for him to seriously challenge for this position. Still The King for now.  **(2) Kawhi Leonard** - Incredible two-way guy who is unguardable when hot. His questionable health prevents him from being #1.  **(3) Kevin Durant** - Absurdly good scorer. Can get a bucket in a multitude of ways. But he's third because he's not an elite defender and people who shed their skin once a month are creepy.  **(4) Jimmy Butler** - Jimmy G Buckets. The G stands for Gets. He's a closer, a good on-ball defender and a great team player.  **(5) Paul George** - I think he had a career year in 2019 because Russ decided to defer to him as a top scoring option. He's a streaky guy who's not as good a shot-creator as the top three guys in this list. I think him and Jimmy are very close tbh.  **(6) Khris Middleton** - Isn't marketable. Plays in a small market. Overshadowed by his MVP teammate. Still a good sharpshooting two-way guy who is reliable at what he does.  **(7) Tobias Harris** - When you consider how valuable excellent wings are, then Tobias and Khris' contracts make a lot more sense. These guys are in the tier below some of the greatest players in the league. Tobias is just another good all-around dude.  **(8) Bojan Bogdanovic** - Insanely efficient scorer and has been doing it longer than the guys in the next two positions.  **(9) Brandon Ingram** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(10) Jaylen Brown** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.   Power Forward:  **(1) Giannis Antetokounmpo** - is a force of nature.  **(2) Anthony Davis** - Most obvious #2 in any position lol.  **(3) Pascal Siakam** - Is currently in his breakthrough year but needs to maintain his form against top teams. Will make All-NBA this year.  **(4) Draymond Green** -Is fantastic at everything but scoring.  **(5) LaMarcus Aldridge** - Game is passing him by but he's still delivering.  **(6) Blake Griffin** - was very good last year but he needs to stay healthy  **(7) Kristaps Porzingis** - Ihas been very good this year but he needs to stay healthy.  **(8) Jayson Tatum** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(9) PJ Tucker** -Mr Iron-man. Great defender. Good shooter. Elite-tier role player.  **(10) Marcus Morris** - is currently shooting 47% from three in January. He made my top 10 on that alone lol.   Center:  **(1) Joel Embiid** - Can put up 27/13 while providing DPOY level defence. Can be a monster against anyone not named Gasol.  **(2) Rudy Gobert** - Averages 15 points while being maybe the best defender in the league. It's very close between him and Jokic.  **(3) Nikola Jokic** - Arguably the best playmaking center of all-time. I don't rate him that much on defence though. It's very close between him and Gobert.  **(4) Karl Anthony Towns** -Excellent offensive force but he's a negative defender in one of the most crucial positions. He needs to improve on that front.  **(5) Nikola Vucevic** - Doesn't get the attention he deserves because of small market. He's a 20/10 guy who's a top defender.  **(6) Deandre Ayton** - This kid is a stud but people don't know it yet because he's bad at peeing.  **(7) Bam Adebayo** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(8) Clint Capela** - Kinda how I'd imagine Drummond to play on a good team.  **(9) Andre Drummond** - Has never had a good guard/roster to play with but has managed to impress regardless. I reckon he could take a major leap forward within the right system. I really hopes he goes to the Hawks.   **(10) Josef Nurkic** - Trailblazers fan will @ me if I omit him so Nurkic gets the #10 spot by default. Sorry Sabonis."
"“Hey guys. Did you know that within the last decade, LeBron James won 3 more rings than Paul George?”"
Lebron James choking to Dallas
"Lebron.  In January 2010 I was lying in bed when I turned on the TV and the basketball was on. I had collected basketball cards as a kid in the 90s but had never really watched basketball before.   I watched enthralled as a guy named Lebron James playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers dominated the court versus the Utah Jazz. Ridiculous three pointers, dunks, Lebron was everywhere and could do everything.  Yet the Jazz came back to make it a 2 point game with seconds left, and it became an all-time finish to remember: https://youtu.be/PI6iQgMp-nA  After that I was hooked and have supported Lebron for a decade through three times. I acknowledge Jordan is the GOAT, but Lebron is my favourite."
LeBron James. Got into the NBA as a young lad around the time he was drafted and seeing a player so well rounded and dominant was crazy as shit to me. He was athletic as hell in those days. Amazing how much of a freak he still is
"Danny Green, Kyle Kuzma, whatever. Do you think that makes it sound better? My comment seemed to strike a nerve.   The same franchise that missed the playoffs with LeBron James, will be second fiddle in their own city by a team led by two players that cucked said team. It’s poetic."
He's our 3rd scoring option. Danny Green is our 3rd best player.   Our first 2 best players are also named LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Our future is in the hands of AD and not some pube-bearded Kobe-wannabe who can reach Paul George-level at best. This is the best the Celtics have looked in years and they're not serious contenders
"CASE FOR LAKERS  History: the Lakers have won 16 championships, they have had some of the greatest basketball players of all time play for them. They are 1 part of the biggest storied rivalry in the nba with the Celtics. They are also one of the oldest teams in the nba so plenty to dig in to if you want to follow how the nba evolved and how play styles evolved since players who played for the Lakers had a huge hand in that, such as players like Magic Johnson, prime Shaq, Jerry west, Elgin Baylor, George Mikan, Kareem Abdul Jabbar. By simply following the Lakers and each of their generational stars, you can really get a grasp of the entire NBA and it’s evolution. Not to mention 2 legendary coaches in Pat Riley and Phil Jackson(could make a case for both for GOAT coach).  Franchise: it’s a family owned franchise for the most part, their late owner Dr Jerry Buss was considered one of, if not the greatest team owner, he brought a lot of innovation to the nba such as cheerleaders, making the game more marketable and the way the game is presented but most importantly by ALWAYS putting the players first no matter what. Today the team is ran by his daughter (only female owner) and the same principals and values exist with her also. The ownership will not cheat the fans by cutting cost and putting their pockets first. It’s always the team, it’s players and fans above all.  Branding: They have one of the biggest fan bases in any sport around the world, which gives fans perks like getting many nationally televised games and games on holidays. It also means lots of fans to interact with and build camaraderie with.  Also ease of accessibility, the jerseys are available everywhere etc   Currently: today they have 2 of the top 5 players in the game, Lebron James and Anthony Davis, which is obviously a pleasure to watch and are in hunt for their 17th title tying the Celtics for the most titles in the NBA  That’s my team, greatest team in the world by far in my eyes lol I’ve loved them as much as anything else in my life since a kid and I wouldn’t change for anything. Good luck! ... PS. We also had Chick Hearn, google him if you aren’t familiar"
Hes still doing a good job now though lmao.  Yall had lebron james and couldnt make the playoffs last year. Pop took a team like that and arguably over achieved in the playoffs last year.  Dude hasnt missed the playoffs in forever and literally revolutionized the game with his playstyle and offensive and defensive scheme. He also kept those players in San Antonio. One of the smallest markets. This is all because of his greatness. You dont know basketball past headlines bro. Please stop you look really dumb right now. delete your comments and just take the L.
&gt; (Living in an injury free world)  You can’t just discount a huge part of an argument because it doesn’t fit your narrative lmfao. One of these really young players could break both of his legs in a skiing accident and we’d never hear about him again.  This is like saying “Kevin Durant is the best player of all time (in a Michael Jordan and LeBron James free world).” You’re throwing important parts of the argument away to strengthen your point
"A top 5 point guard this league, due to Kyrie and Steph being injured. He has been a top 20 player this year, in my opinion.  Point guards (this year): 1. Dame- 2. Russ- 3. Lowry 4. Trae 5. Kemba 6. Ben Simmons 7. Lavine 8. CP3 9. Bledsoe 10. Dinwiddie   My Top 20 (this year)  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. James Harden 3. LeBron James 4. Kawhi Leonard 5.  Anthony Davis 6. Luka Doncic 7.

"Without supposing players could adapt:    SG: 08'-09' Ray Allen    SG: 15'-16' Klay Thompson (yes, I have two shooting guards because Lebron plays the point on offense. Klay would guard the other team's best offensive guard.)    SF: 02'-03' Bruce Bowen    PF: 12-13' Lebron James    C:  03'-04' Kevin Garnett     The reason I build around James instead of Jordan is that I don't believe it is so easy to assume that he would be able to change his playstyle. Jordan used to play in the post and run isos all the time. We know what happened to the post, and isolation without the ability to shoot from three is rare (DeRozan is one of the few to be successful at that today). Of course Jordan would still be amazing, but I don't think it's trivial to guess that he would be able to get a good three point shot. I would go safe by picking an elite defensive team full of elite shooters around Lebron. I think Garnett would be so effective defensively in todays league that even if he doesn't shoot threes it would be ok, he could still spread the floor from mid range.  (btw I also don't think Garnett could adapt easily to shooting threes at all, because even though he was an elite mid range shooter, if you look at his shooting form, he shoots from way behind his head, so it is very hard to expand your range when your form is so messed up). I know I don't have an elite closer but honestly I don't think I would need much hero ball at the end of games with this team... it would be blowing teams away 24/7 Also I'm being realistic about chemistry... If I pick Durant instead of Bowen, Durant won't be so happy standing in the corner and watching Lebron play, so... I chose to go for role players who are proven to accept their roles as three and d."
"As far as die hard Lakers fans are concerned, I kinda understand the position that Kobe is more of a ""true"" Laker legend. Whereas more like Shaq, Lebron's legacy will be remembered in a variety of jerseys. One of which might be purple and gold, but we still don't even know if his Lakers will accomplish anything historically memorable.      For the rest of us, Kobe and Lebron have both been really fun to watch, incredible basketball players while James Harden's game doesn't hit the same spot. It's not an unpopular opinion that while his version of basketball might be effective, it's fucking lame.      I was a Thunder fan during their Finals run, and the regular seasons surrounding it. I remember thinking even then that Harden could definitely score, but I preferred to see Westbrook on the court. Harden's presence as a sixth man was a weapon I was glad to have on our team, but I was never down for being afraid of beards or any of that bullshit."
"&gt; Why do yo insist in comparing him to Kuzma?    Similar efficiency as scorers. Both below average defenders. I agree Murray is better overall, but statistically, he is similar to Kuzma.   &gt; Kuzma has no chance of outshining Lebron and AD.    I mean, I’d hope Kyle Kuzma wasn’t consistently outshining LeBron James and Anthony Davis"
Yea. The Heat team who missed the playoffs when Lebron James left.......oh and their star player Chris Bosh wasn't playing because of health issues. Forgot to mention that small factor there didn't ya?

"It’s easier than that.  Lakers fans spent 8 years watching James ascend, a player who would inevitably usurp Bryant as the face of the NBA while also becoming the world’s best player.    We spent the last 8 years upset that Lebron fulfilled the prophecy, won titles, and crawled toward the inevitable dethroning of the player we loved.   Our champion was on the decline and it hurt to watch a player we had devoted so much love to break down and be the weaker knight in the duel, when we *convinced* ourselves that if they were both in their primes together, our champion would win.  All while having to defend ourselves from younger fans who had a stronger champion better our knight over and over again  And now the hated champion calls our land home. It’s hard to adjust to, because it puts into questions our faith as fans. 😢"
So this guy is Indian Lebron James?
No guys I'm not. Rondo was a beast I understand. But you guys are acting like prime Rondo went toe to toe with prime LeBron James. Come on now.
He did not go toe to toe with LeBron James stop it. What does he have 13 toes?
"Well lets assume LeBron won in the 2009-10 season with the cavs so he wouldn't rejoin the cavs. LeBron joins and the warriors would win the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons easily. Kevin Durant then still joins in 2016 off season and having LeBron at the helm of the side he would likely trade Draymond for the center they would badly need at that point. The center they would get would be none other than DeMarcus Cousins likely as he was quite sick of Sacramento and the fact that the Sacramento front office would likely trade DeMarcus for Draymond considering they wouldn't win in this warriors era anyway so then they would get draymond in prime and some 1st rounders or Iggy to rebuild with a future young core.  The From the 2016-17 season to the 2018-19 season the Golden State Warriors would boast a lineup of  G - Steph Curry  G - Klay Thompson  F - Kevin Durant  F - LeBron James  C - DeMarcus Cousins (prime)  This means the side would have not only the best player in the league, they would have the best, 2nd best, 3rd best players in the league whilst also having the best center in the league whilst having a 5/5 all star starting lineup.  They would undoubtedly win all 5 seasons from 2014-15 to 2018-19 whilst breaking records everywhere and likely sweeping the entire PLAYOFFS multiple years straight. I would assume the team would disband in the 2019 off season with LeBron going to the LA Lakers like he did in our timeline and he would do it with his great friends KD and AD likely winning many more championships in the purple and gold.  LeBron would probably end with something like 11 rings after going to the finals for literally the entire 2010's and a bit of the 2020's, 8 or 9 FMVPs and would likely still post all time career stat highs and would likely be known unanimously as the GOAT."
"Mo Williams has played with  LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin, Andrew Wiggins, Shaq, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard  That's 7.  And I might be missing someone since I didn't really check that much."
that's because Lillard will never play with LeBron James
"&gt;Death, Taxes, and lesser teams forcing Lebron James to play 35+ minutes   Ah yes, I knew that feel"
"Death, Taxes, and lesser teams forcing Lebron James to play 35+ minutes. Thank goodness for CP3 Rondo, haha."
" “In the minutes that Rondo, Davis and Kuzma share the floor, the Lakers have a net rating (points scored minus points allowed per 100 possessions) of -4.9 in 152 minutes this season. Compare that to the net rating of +6.4 in the 175 minutes when Kuzma and AD share the floor and Rondo is out of the game. But while the net rating is a concern, the bigger stats that stand out to me is that in those minutes that Kuzma and Davis have played together without Rondo, the Lakers’ pace and assist rate both go up.”   https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2020/1/9/21057532/lakers-rajon-rondo-stats-analysis-conundrum-lebron-james-anthony-davis-kyle-kuzma-lineups-minutes   Does that sound like a good player to you?  No it’s not the same, teams used to treat him like he was DJ from there, now they have decided to at least close out and his numbers have seriously declined"
He was supposed to be the next LeBron James a year or two ago and now so many other younger (and previously worse) players are outshining him and developing faster than he is.  Obviously Simmons will continue to improve but his ceiling seems so much lower than we initially thought.
Boban has a higher career 3pt % than LeBron James
So is LeBron James a guard? Is Draymond Green a guard?
He’s been pretty bad at times but you shouldn’t expect greatness out of your backup point guard - especially when your primary point guard is LeBron James.    Some Laker fans have been annoyed about the politics of the situation creating minutes for Rondo. Rondo isn’t an easy guy to take out of a rotation when he’s playing poorly when every single player loves him.
"""Hey Mr. James, or LeBron, whatever is best for you lol... Anyways my rehab is going well and that Kuz guy was talking shit last week so I think you should trade him not me"""
"doncic?  edit: its lebron  &gt;Youngest/Oldest player to score 40+ points in a game  &gt;Youngest: LeBron James is the youngest player to score 40+ points in a game, scoring 41 points for the Cleveland Cavaliers against the New Jersey Nets at the age of 19 years, 88 days."
"You think the Chinese government was going to harm Lebron James, an American citizen and one of the most famous people on the planet, because of a tweet? That's fucking delusional.  He said that Morey was ""misinformed"" and ""not educated,"" which was both unnecessary and laughably untrue."
"“Cash my check”?? Or “if you’re saying this place fucking abducts or commits violent acts towards people perhaps wait until I’m out of here so you don’t put me in danger.”  And no, Lebron James is Lebron James and doesn’t get to say nothing, pretty naive to think that’s an option."
"Neither does Luka. Both Harden and Luka take about 1% of there shots between 16 feet and the 3 point line. They take a slightly higher percentage from 10-16, James Harden 2% and Luka Doncic 5%. These two players more than anyone ever take all their shots at the rim or behind the 3 point line.  In comparison, Kobe Bryant shot 28% of his career shots from 16&lt;3.  LeBron has shot 12% of his shots this year from 16&lt;3 and 7% from 10-16."
"He absolutely is. There’s no reason James Harden, or anyone else, should be shooting 200-400 more free throws than Lebron EVERY...SINGLE....YEAR. I can understand it happening once, but this has gone way beyond that and now it’s just gotten silly. I could maybe understand Harden shooting 50 more per year, but we are talking about 300 or more free throw attempts per season than the best attacker of the basket arguably ever. There’s just no way anyone shoulda been bitching about Lebron getting calls this decade with guys like Russ and Harden in the league.   If Lebron was shooting as many free throws as Harden every year, you guys would be going absolutely ballistic about it."
"The Pistons beat the lakers so badly the only game the lakers won was because of a Kobe game winner. That is much more similar to that year Lebron went off on a game 2 against the spurs in 2014. That loss I really wouldn't hold against lebron, his team was outmatched.     To talk about the 2011 flop and say ""So? Shit happens.""  That shit was an epic failure. LeBron was terrible. He scored like 8 points in one of those games. To say that kobe having shaq was somehow a better situation than lebron had in his absolute prime when the heat came together when they were the clear favorites from the beginning unlike Kobe and Shaq who weren't considered this all time ridiculous combination until afterwards is nonsense.     MJ said kobe is better than bron then you know what happens the very next day,   ""Kobe Bryant Embarrasses Lebron James at the All Star Game""    https://www.nbclosangeles.com/local/all-star-kobe-bryant-lebron-james-chris-paul-lakers/2056002/   ""the fact that LeBron leads Kobe in every defensive statistic in less minutes played against better competition""    This is nonsense. There are all kinds of defensive statistics and kobe beat the record 50+ win playoff teams with 24 on the dot which is more than anyone to play the game. The western conference was much tougher competition than lebron faced. Kobe is tied for the record of 1st team all nba defense awards. Lebron doesn't come close to that. He's not really a lockdown defender, he's not that kind of player."

&gt;4 points per 100 possessions better statistic?  [Here it is](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4439/onoff#tab-team_efficiency)  It is a stat that has problems like any other stat but it is one of my favorites. Is a team terrible? You may be tempted to think a certain player on that team is also terrible but if he significantly makes that team better when he is on the court it is an excellent sign. Lebron James for example has always made his team significally better. Steve Nash when he was on the Suns made them significantly better. Luka Doncic doesn't. JJJ makes them worse. If you don't make your team better but you are on a really good team then it isn't a big team unless everyone thinks you are carrying that team :/

"Not as much as they love Jeremy Lin, LeBron James or Kobe Bryant. Every single player with Luka's level of talent has a huge fan base, but because Luka is white suddenly it's all because of that fact.  It's also ironic that minorities are constantly asking for more representation in things that are majority white because it's ""so important to have people you can identify with"", but flip it around and I guess that logic doesn't apply."
Lakers star LeBron James will miss tonight's game in Oklahoma City to watch playoff football.
"he wasn't. ur comparing kobe playing on the biggest franchise in the league to a guy playing in a small town cleveland. the fact that they exchanged all-star votes should tell u something. if james harden was playing on the lakers, u bet he would be the starting 2 guard for the past 6 years in the west (but no he plays in houston).   FYI: caruso's all-star votes should tell u about the fanbase lol.   lebron led the league in jersey sales, all-star votes, AND shoe sales multiple times in his first stint in cleveland. nobody wants to play in cleveland.   and here's the ultimate point: there's a reason kobe doesn't have a shoe line after he has retired (and lebron WILL). lebron is going to be the 2nd player after MJ to have a popular shoe line even when he's not playing."

"Ingram was also my favorite player during the Lakers' shitty stretch of seasons. Seriously thought Ingram would've been our star and guy to build around going forward. I'm extremely happy we ended up with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. But I've watched this team even during our shit years, so when we got Ingram it was nice to finally get somebody with that potential and hopefully be able to watch him grow into that star player with the team. That's why it stung to see him traded away to another team. It was so fun to watch when he took over the Point Guard role for a bit."
"I just like how he has “Lakers star” leading off, I feel just typing Lebron James would have sufficed haha"

"&gt; So, your knock on Drummond is that he can't carry the Pistons God awful roster? Yeah man, he's no fucking LeBron James. We all know that. Thanks for the valuable information.    &gt; Word. Being in the top ten of defensive win shares, defensive box plus minus, defensive rating, steals, blocks, steal %, and block% is actually bad. Noted.       Those are both strawmen.        &gt;  I made the claim that Drummond is a dominant individual defender, and him being at the top of the league of all those statistics directly support that claim.      No you just listed random stats which don't support that claim. Look at the other players who are rated highly by those stats and tell me they still mean something. You also continue to ignore the fact that he has not played on good team defenses, something that dominant centers have been able to do, regardless of surrounding talent."
"I wouldn’t consider Luka any more of a point guard than Simmons, though neither guy is really what I’d consider a point guard so I’m just going to list everyone that is listed as a PG in B-ball Ref.

"&gt; If the hand check didn't impact 6'6 215 Pound MJ or Nique or Bird, or any scorer of the past, it is not impacting 6'8 260 pound LeBron James. Use logic. &gt;  &gt; Jordan averages 3 more PPG for his career  But you're not using logic...  If Jordan scored 3 points per game more in a **more** physical game than today - you think LeBron would drop in and his ppg would be more than 27?  Hell no, LeBron's ppg would drop in the 90s.  &gt;if less talented, less athletic, smaller players averaged high scoring totals in that era.  But LeBron (who is more talented, more athletic and bigger according to you) is scoring less ppg in an era that is not physical at all...  doh"
"Ok, I watched it. His reasoning actually makes it a worse take than before. LeBron James adds more championship equity than any other player in the league, maybe in history."

There are lots of reasons you could not like him, but don't bash the actual good things he does."
"&gt; what kind of shit is this, you're just putting people in the lebron category that don't guard him all game.  Wings today are better than 2's of the 90s that's not debatable. The overall level of athleticism and skill is *significantly* higher than of the 90s as well.   &gt; if the hand check was still allowed lebron would have a much lower ppg.  and he already has a lower ppg than jordan.  If the hand check didn't impact 6'6 215 Pound MJ or Nique or Bird, or any scorer of the past, it is not impacting 6'8 260 pound LeBron James. Use logic.   Jordan averages 3 more PPG for his career   &gt; hand check would hurt him, shit was way more physical 20-30 years ago.  LeBron James is same size as Karl Malone. Please stop this narrative. It is ridiculous to assume LeBron would have problems, If less talented, less athletic, smaller players averaged high scoring totals in that era."
"&gt;LeBron James is reminding us that, as great as ~~Luka Doncic~~ Giannis is, this is still LeBron’s league.  Luka is great and all... But basketball has two parts to it. Offense and defense"
LeBron James inspired me to be a great janitor.    I emulate the way he takes the trash out every game
Imagine thinking lebron fucking James is not a top 5 player in the league
I love how Shannon says ole Goat James.   Skip - lebron aka lowercase goat lol
LeBron James. He is trailing by just a little bit but he is getting a lot more assists a game than Paul is now and LeBron will do it for longer
"I mean, let's be real here. Sometimes I'm glad if I can remember what I had for lunch last week so I'm not gonna act like I'm 100% certain how good a player was 15 years ago to compare them against someone who I was watching this morning.  I also feel like some people can't detach their opinion of LeBron James as a 20 year old from what he has achieved afterwards. Looking at things in a vacuum, in terms of stats, LeBron isn't even close to Luka to sniff him, so much so that Luka's rookie season is a better comparison to LeBron's 20 year old season especially since their usage rate was more similar then. I also have to make sure that I'm not really letting my bias affect things.  Overall I'm really not sure but Luka is leaps and bounds ahead of LBJ in terms of stats, it's not even close, Luka is destroying him and people really don't make an argument as to why LeBron was better, I'd be really interested in that. To be clear: I don't consider merely mentioning pace and spacing as making an argument, at least people should explain how playing at a lower pace and with less spacing makes LBJ a better player even though he produced much less."

LeBron is seen as the consensus GOAT.  Luka is seen similar to how James Harden is now: (puts up amazing stats but cant be seen as #1 player in the league by vast majority of fans/analysts)   There is lots of excitement for the NBA's secondary tourney (in-season or not)
Don't get me started on the classic Matt Harpring vs LeBron James battles.
"Just look at the yearly free throw stats. This has been happening to Lebron for a while  Lebron finishing place in free throws attempted.   2011 - 5th place - Durant and Dwight both played less games than Lebron and still shot more free throws than him. KEVIN MARTIN shot more free throws than Lebron.  2012 - 2nd place - Dwight played 8 less games and still shot 70 more free throws  2013 - 6th place - Harden played 2 more games than Lebron but he shot 257 more than Lebron. Kobe, Dwight and KD all shot more.  2014 - 8th place - KD shot 320 more FTs than Lebron. Even Derozan shot more than him. Harden shot 100 more.  2015 - 4th place- Boogie and Russ played less games than Lebron and still shot more FTs , Russ shot 100 more, Harden shot 300 more  2016 - 11th place - Harden shot 350 more free throws than Lebron. Lebron finished behind KD, PG13, IT, Wiggins, Russ, Deandre, Derozan, Boogie and James. Boogie played 11 less games and shot 200 more free throws   2017 - 12th place - Harden another 340 more than Lebron, same with Russ. Kawhi, Wiggins, Dame, Giannis, AD, IT, Boog, Butler.  2018 - 8th place - Harden another 200 more. Lebron played NINE more games than Dame and still shot less free throws."

"&gt;[Wojnarowski] BREAKING: Heath Ledger will be named head coach after a long, fruitful meeting with Lebron James, Rob Pelinka and Kobe Bryant   &gt; More: Sources say that the fact that Ledger has been dead for a decade didn’t appear to be an issue for either side as an agreement was reached quickly after the team offered a third year.   &gt; “Nah. I didn’t see Coach Heath with, like, with my own eyes..... but Rob said that it’s all good and I trust my GM” said Lebron to reporters following Friday nights game against Dallas"
"I think people are discrediting your take too much. While its not a clear and far-away best season, there's a good argument that its his best season. This is the best record any of his teams have had this many games into a season. The main argument against Harden for not being MVP this season is, seeds matter and scoring isn't everything. LeBron's team is 1st, and his PPG dropped slightly, but that's because he's playing with a GREAT cast. Anthony Davis is the best player he's ever teamed up with (Wade may be better across the span of his career, but LeBron got Wade at the tail-end of his prime, while he got AD just entering it, and a world-class defensive big who can stretch the floor compliments LeBron a lot more than a great slasher and mid-range pull-up shooter). James is also scoring the most 3 pointers per game in his career. And he's leading the league by a wide margin averaging 11 assists per game. Great point guards with PPGs around 15 averaging 11 assists are considered super important, and LeBron is doing that.  The insane adjustments he's made as a passer I think qualify this as one of his best seasons. Most analysts predicted that LeBron would transition into a low-post powerhouse as he ages due to his huge strength advantage, and LeBron went the exact opposite way. He isn't becoming a PF, he's becoming a PG as he ages. A position that requires even more athleticism on a play-to-play basis than LeBron's natural position (SF). Of course, LeBron has always been a sort of point-forward, but he's backed up his transition to a PG by averaging 11 fucking assists a game.   This is absolutely insane and I think shouldn't be shrugged away as an average LeBron season, its one of his best, and by far his most unique great season."
&gt;LeBron James is having a season of basketball and here's why you should care
His value is in his ability to guard Lebron James and Kawhi Leonard competently in the playoffs.  Very few players in the league can guard the big playmaking wings that dominate the league.
LeBron James is an absolute unit

Ingram is better than everyone on the Celtics except the guy who is 29 and Zion is the most hyped 1st pick since LeBron James
Lebron James averages 0.7 points per minute.  Zion sitting at 1.22 points per minute.   **Insane.**
Zion’s nba career is closer to Anthony Bennet than LeBron James
Dick move   Also I got interested and looked up a bunch of players and they were all about what you would expect except  Bronny James has 4.1 Mill followers.. pretty damn crazy for a HS freshman even if his dad is Lebron (55 Mill followers)
THERES SO MANY COMMENTS EVERYONE KNOWS ZION IS THE NEXT LEBRON JAMES
"I'm ready to declare him a bust when he dosen't live up to the Lebron James + Tiger Woods + Wayne Gretzky hype. If he dosen't score 81 points what place does he have in this league. What a fucking scrub he'll be, look he hasn't scored in the first minute BUST!"
Michael Jordan scored 16 points in his debut against the Washington Bullets. LeBron James scored 25 points in his debut against the Sacramento Kings
First time this season that i am watching nba game. But fuck me dude literally everyone are talking about this Zion guy. I have to watch the debut of the new Lebron James.
"""Hey, we're not saying Zion is the next Lebron James. He's the next Wayne Gretzky and Tiger Woods and Lebron James. GO FUCKING WATCH IT YOU WHORES"""
Lebron James wears #23 to honor Fred VanVleet.

"Derrick Rose's MVP was appropriate.  The MVP award is not the ""Best Player"" award.  If it were, it would have to LeBron for every year he was in the league.  The award goes to the most ""valuable"" player.  That term is best interpreted to mean the player who contributed the most to a team's success.  But the team's success has to be factored into the equation -- otherwise, you could see MVP awards going to players on dogshit teams, which seems counter-intuitive and against the spirit of the award.  The Bulls were the best team in the league during the 2010-2011 season.  Rose was the best player on the team and a necessary, integral part of the Bulls' success that year.  LeBron James was the better player.  Dwight Howard arguably had better stats that year.  But D Rose was the best player on the best team, and his MVP was appropriate."
"His shooting nights, with Iguodala draped all over him: 18-38, 11-35, 14-34, 7-22, 15-34 and 13-33. That’s a .398 shooting percentage from the floor.   After a surprising lead of 2-1 games after 3, everyone knew Game 4 was the tipping point in the NBA Finals. James needed to win the game to put the Warriors away. So what did LeBron do with the series on the line? He put up 20 points on 7-22 shooting, a .314 shooting percentage, a 5-10 night from the free-throw line.   his 13-33 performance in the series-clinching game  [LeBron performance ](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2015/06/lebron-james-had-the-worst-awesome-performance-in-nba-finals-history/amp)"

"&gt;Okay little guy  Okay nephew. Lmao  &gt;when presented with facts  What facts? Those name calling are facts? Lmao  &gt;Come up with any context where Kobe is even close as a playmaker compared to Harden  Quote me if I said something like this. Lol nephew. My point is assist is not the only metric for playmaking ability. Prove me then that Westbrook is a better playmaker than LeBron since you like assists very much. Lmao nephew   &gt;Kobe couldn't even top 5 a game with prime Shaq  So what? LeBron didn't even top 5 aswell when he played with Shaq. Shaq has nothing to do with it. Lmao.  &gt;still ran the PnR a fucking ton in his career  Yeah right nephew. You are indeed 28 years old. Lmao.   Your takes are comedy nephew. Assists are the baseline for playmaking ability right? So answer this question, is westbrook a better playmaker than James from 2014-2019? Lmao"
"You’re acting like LeBron is some scared role player. He’s LeBron fucking James, he isn’t scared of anything. As a Raptor fan, I’d know this pretty well."
"So, if y'all remember, Steph Curry and LeBron James were born in the same hospital. If it worked out, Imagine a three headed monster of a healthy Steph Curry, LeBron James, and Anthony Davis. I am shaking just thinking about it."
"No one is giving him credit for taking “bad shots” — he’s making them at 35 percent clip, which is decent value in a vacuum.   There’s also way more to shooting than percentages: gravity, spacing, volume, variability, etc. Gorgui Dieng is shooting 40 percent from 3 this year, James Harden has never shot at that level. Is Dieng considered a better shooter than Harden? Or course not. Because we recognize that the value isn’t tied only to the percentages.   Covington is respected as a shooter and has legitimate gravity. He also tends to space WAY outside the 3-pt line, which helps spacing more than someone who toes it — tracking data has him attempting 4.8 threes from 25+ feet, which accounts for 75 percent of his 3pt attempts, one of the highest percentages in the league.  Even if his shot profile doesn’t change, he brings value with the current percentages. There’s also the clear implication that in an easier role (e.g. - spotting up for a catch and shoot 3 off a LeBron-AD pick and roll) his percentages could jump back up (he’s been a career 36 percent shooter and shot 37 and 38 percent the previous two seasons)."
He only created that rule to exclude LeBron James from any All-NBA team last season. It obviously compromised some of his other picks because you could tell he liked some players on sub-.500 teams but had to remain consistent to exclude LeBron.
" \- Lebron is definitely more clutch than Kobe and MJ during playoffs, and overall the clutchest player in playoffs history:  8 game winners vs kobe 3 and MJ 5.   Also  ""Game-tying/go-ahead field goals with under 10 seconds left in the postseason""     *Michael Jordan: 7/15 (47%)*   *Kobe Bryant: 5/22 (23%)*   *LeBron James: 12/23 (52%)*"
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
Poor kid. Lebron James tweeting about it blew it out of proportion.

"The Amazing Lebron James -   During the 2008-09 NBA season Lebron James accumulated a higher VORP, or value over replacement player (11.6), than DeMar DeRozan has accumulated in his 11 year career.   The DeMar Impact -   2012-13. The last (and only) time a DeMar Derozan led team statistically performed better with him on the court. Stunning to consider that as we just entered a new decade the last time DeMar had a positive on/off was in the early portion of the LAST decade."
"LeBron James is only 5'9""."
"Nah, he has played most games listed as a PG this season.  Just because a player is versatile doesn’t mean he cannot be included in position rankings. If you consider Lebron a point-forward, that’s fine, but saying we can’t include him in PG, SF, and PF rankings is dumb.  If so, we can’t include James Harden in shooting guard rankings and Bradley Beal would be the #1 shooting guard in the NBA. See how silly that is?  Luka is primarily a PG, and can be ranked as such."
"no i actually dont remember. gobert is 8-6 vs ad all time, without lebron james, hes 8-4  i have a small hunch that lebron is by far the most important factor on the lakers  but shit maybe im wrong"
I would if he was getting paid as much as lebron James to play basketball.
"So he says, criticizing a team with *LeBron James* as being too soft for playoffs."
Call the Celtics whatever you want but they will always be a better organization than the shitshow that is the cavaliers who live and die on the back of Lebron James.
"It felt like Lebron was in his greatest flow state they playoffs, if he won game one with 51/9/9 or whatever brain melting stat line he actually put up, there’s a .1% chance the momentum could be carried on to total victory.   The two best shooters of all time, the most consistent scorer ever and a perfectly complimentary defensive piece are a fair fight for him at his peak, that’s like 3.5=1.   He nearly willed the supporting cast of Semi-Pro to a victory in the finals against one of two options for the best team of all time. That’s a fucking real live magic trick.   LeBron James could do it for sure if he never snaps with rage after that JR fumble, which in itself is hilarious."

"LeBron James completely jumping over John Lucas for the dunk is a criminally underrated moment, and Lucas was a Bull ffs  That dunk doesn't nearly get enough recognition for how easily LeBron cleared him"

Just a reminder that Lebron James doesn't give a fuck about the holocaust in China
Good luck defending Anthony Davis and LeBron James with Isaiah Hartenstein.
"True story.   It takes guts for guys to step up and contest, particularly when the world is watching. I still remember some local poster dunks around my way and those dunks' corresponding victims. But that's mostly just between me and whoever else was around that day.  In the NBA, some guys have their entire legacies carved out on account of being dunked on. Alton Lister played 16 years in the NBA and is 37th all-time in blocked shots. However, his surviving legacy is that of being on the receiving end of the [Lister Blister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2GaAWdHwsw).   Frederic Weis, Anderson Varejao, Damon Jones, Jason Terry, John Lucas III... in many cases you only need to mention one's name to harken back to one of their most defeating NBA moments (at the hands of, in order: Vince Carter, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, LeBron James, and LeBron James).   Of course, when you're making the big bucks, my hope has always been that an NBA player will have the guts to step up and make a go of it, worrying about the repercussions later. And that's why guys like Alonzo Mourning transcend into that ultimate respect zone. I've even always had love for Anthony Tolliver for being a dude that'll attempt anything to help his team try to win, even when it culminated in being baptized by Amar'e Stoudemire and DeMar DeRozan years apart."

"Ahhh yes, because LeBron James- former VP of the NBPA was an ethical centerpiece in the “More than an athlete” campaign with his statements regarding China.   Maybe it’s different with him being the President and I could absolutely be wrong but I’m not sure."
"LeBron ""Uncle Ben"" James"
"To be fair they don’t have a Lebron James and AD, the superstar who forced a trade away from the Pelicans.  The narrative is focused on the Lakers. One of the best players in the league in Lebron and someone who forced their way to join him. higher expectations on the Lakers I feel."
"“Looking”??? What do you think OKC is doing right now? They’re gathering draft picks so that they can continue to trade them for future draft picks. Meanwhile they are sending multiple spies, both men and women, to Bronny’s high school to get an idea for his type. Then they will choose the perfect 18 year old girl (waiting until he turns 18 of course) and get her some treatment that ensures she gets pregnant with multiple Bronny babies. Then there it is, the ultimate draft. 2040, picks 1, 2, and 4 go to OKC and with those picks they draft Lebron James III, Max James, and Delonte James triplets from High school and their legacy will be nothing but perfection. One will set the record for most career assists, one with points, and one with rebounds. It is destiny."

"Not to burst ya delusional bubble or anything.. but a two handed soft as fuck dunk means 'DunKing aLL oVer LeBron JaMES""?? The fuck  &gt;  The other post on the front page is even more hilarious.

LMFAO   &gt;  It goes to show that just putting on some clickbait title, with LeBron's name mixed in it.. will get you endless amount of attention, atleast for a day or two.  That post really got over 300 awards or somethin. Jesus Christ  &gt;  All those money on a click bait post about a soft ass dunk, just because LeBron of all people was on the other end trying to play help defense.   &gt;   300+ reddit awards for that? What a bloody waste.. Half of that money would have been an actual better use if it was donated to Australia, for them horrendous bush fires..     Y'all incels out here really that dense..  Yikes"
"I never got how people call James Harden ""James"" and expect me not to get confused with LeBron James. I mean LeBron is known by ""LeBron"", I get that, but he is fucking LeBron!

ive read about it. [heres](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2692760-he-was-a-man-amongst-boys-catching-up-with-lebron-james-high-school-qbs) a good article.
"Popovich:  &gt;San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich praised Boston Celtics forward, Jayson Tatum, calling him a “genuine two-way player”. &gt;  &gt; “There aren’t that many two-way players in the league. Genuine [two-way players]. &gt;  &gt; Some think they are, but you can count them on one hand, and he’s got the possibility to be one of those,” the legendary coach said of Tatum, per Brian Robb of Boston Sports Journal.   Lebron:  &gt; “I just love everything about the kid,” James said of Tatum following Game 7. “The way he plays the game, his demeanor, where he comes from. &gt;  &gt; “I just know he's just built for stardom. He's built for success.”"
Ok. Oladipo left become an all star. Made the pacers playoff worthy. Even took LeBron to seven games a few years ago. Harden leaves and becomes the best scorer basketball has seen since Kobe. KD leaves and his stats stay the same even tho he has to share the ball with 4 other great players. Two of them being definite hall of famers. It’s no surprise that now since Russ is being more controlling these last 5 games they have not only lost games but James harden’s plus minus is -4.2 on average. I’d totaled it’s -21. And harden has only shot above 40% once from the field. His career average is 45%. And in three of these last five he has gone below 30% from the field. That’s awful.
He was 240 when he was still in high school lol.  https://www.nbadraft.net/players/lebron-james/  You're insane if you don't think he was 30-40 pounds heavier than that in Miami. Just look at some photos.
I mean Westbrook making the right decisions is basically just a tinier version of LeBron James
As if teams don’t also double LeBron fucking James lmao.
"Tbh if I was in high school and my game broadcasted in any national TV I'd be thrilled let alone the behemoth ESPN is.  I'm not against the idea of high school matches getting broadcasted, I would even encourage it if I had power to do so but broadcasting it just because  LeBron James' son playing is a scummy move."

I agree he would still keep majority of fans but lose respect of people who were just mutual like when Lebron James made those comments about China
Kemba Walker finally beat LeBron James.  And how !  Bravo to him and to Boston for this great victory over unrecognizable Lakers.
"I have no words for this kind of delusion. Lebron James is and always has been a better player than AD. Heck AD isn't even a better scorer than Lebron despite doing more of the scoring. He's nowhere near as versatile or skilled. He is a better defender, though, can't argue that."

Lebron James is the leade leaguer in assit
Smart did a great behind the back seam bounce pass in the paint and instead of praising it Webber says how good Dwight Howard’s defense is .. legit made no sense but it’s his opportunity to dick jump like most shitty commentary teams now. It’s the same in the nfl .. whoever has the ball or is involved in a good play is the greatest of all time    Lebron James is the leade leaguer in assists
He doesn't really need it to be honest.  He's already LeBron James' son.
Eh. They’re good high school players but they’re not *that* good. “Bronny” is obviously skilled but no one would wanna watch his games if his name wasn’t literally “Lebron James”.
"He's right, but the media's made money off highschool kids for years. What do you think the all-American game benefits?   Shit, Brian Windhorst built his entire career of covering LeBron James and that started when LBJ was in highschool.  LaMelo was on national TV, everyone knew who Zion and RJ were before they every got to Duke.   So either we stop covering high school kids completely, which includes national AAU tournaments, international showcases  and exhibitions or we accept it's part of today's basketball culture. You can't just point to Sierra Canyon."
All these LeBron James mom comments are so corny. Prayers up for Deonte

And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
No and Delonte had gone on record as saying the rumors really hurt him.  [Here is a pretty good article from Sports Illustrated from a few years ago.](https://www.si.com/nba/point-forward/2013/08/11/delonte-west-gloria-james-lebron-james-rumors-cleveland-cavaliers-dallas-mavericks)

" &gt;when players like TOBIAS HARRIS and KHRIS MIDDELETON can get paid the same amount of money as LEBRON JAMES and KEVIN DURANT there is a serious fking problem.  I'm the future don't just say it's a problem, explain why it is a problem."
Lebron James! Da hardest hitting powah forwahd in da league!
"It's not like the Premier League. The NBA plays 82 games in the regular season. The top sixteen teams (eight from the Eastern Conference and eight from the Western Conference) then advance to the playoffs, which is tournament format, until a winner is crowned. Each round of the playoffs is a series of games, not just a one-and-done thing. There is no promotion or relegation, although I've always liked that about football.   Look up videos on YouTube. The history of the game and the NBA is extremely fascinating and engaging. There are loads of players and teams you should look up. Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Bill Russell, Magic Johnson, Dr J., Larry Bird, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Allen Iverson, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Michael Jordan (widely regarded as the best ever), and of course Kobe Bryant. The most historic rivalry is probably between the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers."
"""God gave me wide shoulders for a reason"" LeBron James said on the burden of playing through grief."
"&gt; The argument that it shouldn’t be a player is strange since it’s currently a player.   It's a silhouette, which most casual fans (which is most fans) don't know is based on Jerry West.   &gt; The argument that it should be a player greater than Kobe is strange since Jerry West is not greater than Kobe.   West was arguably the greatest when the logo was made. Also, when the logo was pitched, it wasn't pitched as Jerry West. It was just a silhouette, which the designer felt embodied basketball. He also is against changing it to a specific player. His words: ""I don’t think it can be based on any one player. There are 50 to 80 world-class players in the history of the NBA. It should be symbolic of the sport. I think it would be a mistake if it was patterned toward anybody, LeBron James, or whoever.""   &gt; The argument that it would be disrespectful to West to change it to Kobe is strange since West himself said he doesn’t want to be the logo.   He also has said that he thinks if it is changed, it should be changed to Jordan.   There really isnt an argument that supports changing it to kobe."

News flash: Lebron James will be a first ballot hall of famer.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/28/lebron-james-kobe-bryant-death-tribute-nba-basketball  Here's a link to Lebron's statement
"Good. I like the wearing of numbers are remembrance rather than just sticking it in the rafters and letting it gather dust.   Celtics legend James ‘Loscy’ Loscutoff refused to have his number retired by the Celtics as he wanted to have future players use his number. The Cs put the banner ‘LOSCY’ up in the rafters for him and 18  kept on going (until it was retired for Dave Cowens ;)  I like this as a way to remember a player. Most new fans have no idea who those numbers belong to, but they can read LOSCY.   I think having teams retire a players number is a little unnecessary, like the Heat retiring 23 for Jordan.  I like new players taking on the number of their favourite players (like rookie LeBron taking 23) in honour of them."
"The Indiana Pacers. They'll always be that team that's very good, but have to face Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, or the next generational talent.(Giannis) It's okay, I believe every year they can win. :)  EDIT: Or have something happen in Auburn Hills, that escapes me though."
"I'm sure that Nike, the company that worked with Kobe for decades, the company that isn't currently selling Kobe products because they don't want it to become a money grab for people on the secondary market, would allow anyone at this current time to change their number if they wore 8 or 24. Nike didn't allow LeBron James to change his number because they had already printed a shit ton of them and it wasn't that meaningful.   This is symbolic and even from a monetary standpoint would be the ill advised decision to make. Nike forcing a player to continue to wear those numbers in the wake of this tragedy would hurt them financially more than throwing away every LeBron jersey they produced this entire season."
He didn't put out the documentary about himself man what you on about.  It was produced by Uninterrupted aka LeBron James. Who the fk is gonna say no to that?  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carter_Effect
"I'm in tears. I never thought I would see Shaq cry... I feel his pain so much. I'm just so thankful hes alive and I hope that all of us who love Kobe including his family and friends get through this together.  I maybe a Spurs fan. But I 100 percent want the Lakers to win the Championship this year for Kobe and his daughter. It won't bring Kobe back. But it would be a very bittersweet moment that Los Angeles needs right now. I'd also be fine if the Clippers won too as my 2nd choice.  LeBron James, I hope you go help lead that team to a Championship. The city needs you more then ever and everyone right now I think would be okay if you won it this year. :)"
He’s not some monster lol. His goofy stuff on social media is just an act (which he is probably realized he needs to cut back now that he’s getting more serious).    Lebron even takes his son to train with Arenas:  https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2019/09/01/bronny-lebron-james-nba-all-star-gilbert-arenas-basketball-workout-gym/
"&amp;#x200B;  Shaq in these last three wins averaged 1.7 ppg on 11% (1/9 from floor). Kobe meanwhile averaged 11 ppg on 67%, also hit a game winner and outscored the Spurs single handedl for long stretches in the fourth. Duncan choking was another big factor, and I'm sure Shaq was taking care of business on defense but offensively the difference in production is so huge.  &amp;#x200B;  2002 Kings-Lakers series:  &amp;#x200B;  Kobe averaged 8.6 ppg on 43%, 96% on FTs and had just 5 turnovers. Shaq averaged just 5.4 ppg on 31%, 68% FTs and had 8 turnovers. Kobe’s lowest scoring fourth quarter was in the game 7, he had 4 pts but took only 2 shots (one a bailout three, another a tip in attempt at the buzzer). But he spoonfed Shaq and others in the quarter. Shaq was 2/7 in the fourth (and had 2 TOs), and his only two made shots came when Kobe spoonfed him a dunk and a layup. He did step up in OT though (6 pts on 2/5).  &amp;#x200B;  2002 Kings-Lakers series:  &amp;#x200B;  I don’t think Shaq played poorly because he was “choking”, he just wasn’t well conditioned enough to play tough, physical series that season. He had a bunch of nagging injuries (foot and index finger) he was dealing with and wasn't in great shape. You can see most of his shots came shot.  &amp;#x200B;  I continue to be amused by those who think Kobe piggybacked to anything in ’01 and ’02. What he did in ’01 speaks for itself (a ridiculous 32/7/6 average in the West), but he usually gets less credit for being a beast in fourth quarters in ’02.  &amp;#x200B;  Net Rating (in the clutch as defined above) is Offensive Rating – Defensive Rating:  &amp;#x200B;  1. Dirk Nowitzki (10-11): +71.8  2. David Robinson (98-99): +62.5  3. Tim Duncan (98-99): +54.3  4. Shaquille O’neal (01-02): +50.3  5. Lebron James (13-14): +49.8  6. Kobe Bryant (01-02): +44.4  7. Scottie Pippen (96-97): +40.5  8. Michael Jordan (96-97): +39.7  9. Tim Duncan (13-14): +39.4  10. Lebron James (06-07): +37.3  &amp;#x200B;  You know the guy who does have a great clutch rep that he certainly doesn't deserve? The ludicrously overrated Paul Pierce. Notice how his numbers pale in comparison to Bryant.  &amp;#x200B;  Image  &amp;#x200B;  Image  &amp;#x200B;  Kobe vs Lebron in Clutch Situations  I posted some clutch stats for the playoffs, and I decided to do some more.  &amp;#x200B;  I was criticized for using five minutes and margin of five, people also told me to add playmaking as part of the equation.  &amp;#x200B;  I do admit creating for your teammates is a huge factor in clutch situations, so I decided to add assists per 36 and turnovers per 36."
I actually know a guy named Michael Jordan.   He’s quite old.   I also met a guy once named James Lebron. There are 162 people with that name. Must be weird to basically be unsearchable online.
"Why is there only one Lebron James, at least counting his son that makes two"
"&gt;  but you can't deny that he does ""cherry-pick"" what to value a lot of the time particularly with defense  No he doesn’t. He’s consistently said off-ball and help defense is more valuable than one-on-one man defense and has half a dozen statistical models to prove it.   &gt; just last year he had a video claiming Lebron was still a good defender and he chose to pick instances where Lebron was able to defend his man well in the 1 on 1 while skirting over the fact that Lebron, at least last year, barely tried to defend when his man was off ball. His conclusion was basically that Lebron was still good as a 1 on 1 defender and even despite his lapses off ball was therefore still a good defender. That was basically exactly the same as Kobe in his later years except in Kobe's case Taylor decided that it meant Kobe was no longer a good defender/overrated on defense.  I just rewatched the video, Taylor cites impact metrics favoring LeBron but says they overrate his real value, word for word he said “in 2019, I rank LeBron James as an ever-so slightly positive defender”, he didn’t say a good defender like you’re claiming, and both Kobe’s impact metrics and on-court defensive value were lower post-Shaq years."
Lol if you put prime LeBron James on this team we wouldn't have 17 more wins
"Jayson Tatum is a very good, young player who had a very good game playing against LeBron, but it's the absurdity of the quote that makes it funny. Sometimes reporters that cover the NBA tweet out stories and quotes with a little dramatic flair in an attempt to make a narrative, but they come out a little awkward.  Here are a few more:  &gt; Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!” Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”  &gt; Cuban beside himself. Driving around downtown Houston begging (thru texts) Jordan's family 4 Address Deandre's home.  &gt; At one point in a scrimmage, sources said, Butler turned to GM Scott Layden and screamed, ""You (bleeping) need me. You can't win without me."" Butler left teammates and coaches largely speechless. He dominated the gym in every way. Jimmy's back."
"Yes. The bucks allowed the heat the beat them out of pity for LeBron James and Jennings decided not to destroy them in 6 games, thus deciding to save their strength"
"&gt; 90% of the times the right play is pass the ball  because it's the right play doesn't mean it was the best play. i.e. not all passes are equally great. Because both the timing of the pass and the position of the pass as it comes has a huge affect on the scoring of the player.    here's an article talking about the latter aspect (https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-memorized-how-teammates-like-passes-2016-12)    The difference between say Kawhi, KD and other great scorers and Lebron (and other great passers, like CP3) is that Kawhi, KD, etc will make a good pass, often to the right person out of a double team. This pass primary function is to get the team on a 4-on-3 situation for the rest of the team.  But Lebron, CP3 etc, will not only pass it to the right person, they'll often get it there a little sooner, at the preferred height of the shooter, and with the seams of the ball in the preferred orientation. The difference between the two types of passes is that the shooter will have more time, and be in better rhythm to shoot.   The main premise is that a good passers knows when to pass, and knows that his assist numbers are often a function of how well the shooters around him do. But a great passers, recognizes it the other way around. He understands that his passing, and the quality of it, can affect his assist numbers *because* his passes can affect the shooters numbers."
"Stems for the 2013 NBA playoffs where the absolutely dominant 8-seed Milwaukee Bucks (38-44), led by none other than career-high 55 point scorer, Brandon Jennings, took on the severely less-talented and overrated 1-seed Miami Heat (66-16), led by prime (scrub) Lebron James and (trash) D-Wade. Before the series, Brandon Jennings said he thinks the Bucks will win in 6. Unfortunately, the Heat somehow pulled off the miraculous feat of sweeping the Bucks in 4 games and then continued on to win the title that year, overshadowing just how great that Milwaukee Bucks team was."
"""Oh, will you look at that! 🐍, the number formerly known as 35, with the two-handed jam!"" - Commentator LeBron James MCXII (in his first game after his latest cloning procedure)"
"&gt; Stockton is the all time NBA leader in both assists and steals.   by a fucking mile for assists. Chris Paul and Lebron James are the only ones ""close"" to him now that are active and each with their current numbers/averages would need 10 years to catch up."
"Huh, I don't give a what? *confused*  There are several reasons I am against it.   The most important reason is that it actually takes away the ability to honor him.  What if the league told LeBron James that he couldn't wear #23 when he came out of High School? Even though he got drafted to the Cavs and not the Bulls.  Of course, LeBron wore #23 to honor Jordan.  More legends will come and go. Should the league retire Jordan's number when he, God forbid, dies? Or Bill Russell's? Where does this stop?"
"What Stephen said hits home. I've been an athlete my whole life, putting my body through football tackles, and putting my knees and back through jumping for rebounds. My body ain't what it used to be as I'm in my 30s. But I take a look at LeBron James, and see how he takes care of his body and is ready to go every day, that's what I want, that's actually my new year's resolution this year, to get my body functioning like a well oiled machine. So, I'm inspires by LeBron. Then, I know I need the  heart, and drive to do it, and that's where Mamba Mentality comes in. I still play sports to this day, but many times I have to sit out because of back injuries, knee injuries. So it's my resolution this year to begin a new, to eat right and to take care of my body so I can continue to do what I love."
"You're telling LeBron James, who actually had a real relationship with Kobe Bryant, to his name out his mouth? What a moronic pathetic take. Even in moments like this you find ways to be toxic. Showing you're true colors as a person. I'm glad I don't know you in real life. You sound terrible."
Such bullshit outrage. Lebron James has no obligation to the people of Hong Kong.
"I mean, [he wasn't though](https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-2-week-break-turned-his-season-around-2015-4)  he had some nagging stuff, but he had been playing with it all season. It was really a mental break as much as anything, and I think even he would say the same thing.  If it was just a physical injury, why would he leave the team?  he even had some quotes hinting at it around the time: ""It's too long, it's too many emotions, it's too many things, it's too many storylines that if you let yourself get involved in it too much that it can bother you mentally"""
My guy not everyone is lebron james
Yes I watch it but those players are not recognized how could you come to a conclusion such as this. You just said many players looked up to Kobe Bryant right not the other way around so why not pay tribute to him and retire his number. There has only been three basketball players who were mvp to die. Just think about that. Hell not even Bill Russell is dead yet. But even worse the way Kobe died. Look I’m not here to debate you it’s my personal opinion hopefully you understand as a big basketball fan who loves lebron James this hurt me just as much to see a legend pass away.
"I know this post is kind of jokey/sarcastic, but I swear, EJs been kinda overlooked the entire time he’s been in the league.   I specifically remember a graphic from 2011 or 2012 that was “high scoring tandems in the league”. \#1 was Durant and Westbrook, \#2 was LeBron and Wade, and \#3 was Blake Griffin and EJ. But EJ was never in the same conversation as the others in terms of being one of the “top players in the league” despite quite literally putting up the same averages as Westbrook throughout his career at that time (they came in the league at the same time).   Injuries and general disdain for the New Orleans organization explains, to me at least, why he didn’t “take over” that team when he was the guy. And now, on the Rockets, he’s on a team built around giving James Harden the ball. And Westbrook is on the team too. But a healthy EJ being the ball dominant guy will give you every bit as much as Harden will."
LeBron James.
Have you never heard of LeBron James.
That's why it seems very disingenous on LeBron's part. Shaq calling Kobe his brother and Giannia his niece is much different than LeBron James saying that.
"\&gt; Jordan was never close to Bryant, and Bryant was never close to [LeBron James](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james),  and that's just how it goes with most of these iconic stars. The  competition is cutthroat -- and it doesn't matter whether they're competing in real time or for the historical narrative.    That's a strange thing to write, given that the opposite is being reported. Is Woj suggesting that Jordan and Lebron are exaggerating or misrepresenting the closeness of their relationship with Kobe?"
Fuck you LeBron James. Punk ass bitch.
"I'm just happy to have been alive to see Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James play B-ball. No one will ever come close to their dominance in the 90s, 00s and 010's"
You laugh now but as we speak my sources have just told me that Rich Paul is in serious negotiation with Elon Musk to produce bionic limbs for LeBron James and a cryocore chamber where his vital organs and brain can remain in homeostasis.
"I watched Kobe from his rookie season. He's an all time great. Had great talent and work ethics to work his game close to perfection. Yet, I believe LeBron James is the GOAT. You don't have to be a fucking asshole spouting bullshit about LeBron to make your case for Kobe."

"We already saw LeBron ""Magic"" James. Now is time to turn the jets up a bit and be LeBron King Cobra James"
From someone above: Lebron King Cobra James.  Evolved to honor Kobe.

I am now a Lakers fan for the rest of the year!! Bring it back to LA for Kobe!! Lebron James will be on a mission!
"LeBron ""MambaPrime"" James"
When they do finally play their next game I swear Lebron James is going to pop off and hit like 60+ points.
"The monkey-paw-curling awfulness of the timing was not lost on me either.  But I think you're wrong on your last point. I was [just reading](https://theathletic.com/1562789/2020/01/27/hoop-thoughts-kobes-impact-on-the-college-game-a-bizarre-departure-at-kentucky-memphis-plummets-my-top-25-and-more/?source=shared-article) about Sabrina Ionescu suiting up last night after hearing about Kobe's passing, a man whom she had gotten to know personally, along with Gigi. She said afterward, simply, ""This season's for him.""  Hardly a doubt in my mind LeBron James will be thinking something similar."
"Your take is bad and you should feel bad.  There was a lot of sports talk today about the decision to fly - several pilots/private charter guys explained that they have told customers ""Under no circumstances should we fly today"" and the customer basically throws their money/rep around and is like get this bitch in the air.   We're talking about the mamba. 0% chance that guy doesn't go wherever the fuck he wants, whenever the fuck he wants, with zero regard for some bitchass fog.   A Cleveland reporter had a now-eerie story about LeBron James. The Cavs we're on a flight back from a road game, and the guys were playing cards in the middle of awful turbulence. Some of the new guys are getting anxious and debate calling the game to buckle up, etc - LeBron stops them saying: ""This plane ain't goin down with LeBron Fucking James on it. Deal the cards.""  Dudes at this level think they're invincible, because truthfully, on the court/field...they are."
"Lakers are definitely, 10000000% winning it all this year and Lebron James is going to put up some absolutely ridiculous numbers the rest of the way and in the playoffs"
"It’s hard to comprehend just how big the Bryant family could be considered to be.  Former players, former coaches, longtime associates, friends of the children, friends of Vanessa, friends of Kobe outside of basketball, even the fans who have grown up to have Kobe as a constant piece of who they are as fans and people. He just had this tractor beam of charisma, wisdom and warmth off the court that everyone on this planet should strive to accomplish. I started watching basketball at the tail-end of his career, and not one aspect of the nba above Kobe makes me kick myself for not getting into it sooner.  Everyone has their opinion about LeBron the player and LeBron the businessman, but LeBron James is an amazing human being. I cannot fathom just how hard it’s hitting him, let alone the family losing a husband and father, daughter and sister. I truly hope LeBron will be able to reach out to whoever he has to to work through this. I wish he had taken more time to speak on this for his sake but when he isn’t in “Taco Tuesday Dad” mode, he really knows how to convey his emotions through any medium.  Rest In Peace Kobe, Rest In Peace Gianna. History is written by the victors, and you’ll both be remembered forever for more than just your talent on the court."

[Here](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2873165-lebron-james-its-surreal-to-pass-lakers-legend-kobe-bryant-on-scoring-list …bleacherreport.com) the twitter post on the page  has a link to the video as well. If you watch the video skip to 3:30 in
Lebron james
"Where is LeBron when his people need him? Oh that's right. He's gone silent to grieve on his own. He wants to be the face of the NBA but can't muster the strength to uplift the millions of fans who want to hear from their so called ""King James"". He's waited too long to speak on it at this point."
"The burden that LeBron James must carry is almost unfathomable..  He passed him in scoring the night before...  He was the last person Kobe tweeted to..  This is the type of event that would make LeBron just straight up retire midseason because the basketball court will never be the same.  Dwayne Wades video yesterday on Insta where he says, ""these are the moments we ask why"" just has me all fucked up.."
It just struck me like the last game of basketball Kobe watched was Lebron James pass him on the scoring list as a member of the Lakers in his home city of Philadelphia.
"i love Harlan, I like him more than Breen - my favorite call ever is the ""LeBron James with no regard for human life!"" But Breen is still the announcing face of the NBA for me and has more iconic calls."
"I mean. That last tweet...is just prophetic.   Kobe was about to do so much more. For children's empowerment, women's sports, leadership and mental fitness.  It's as if he has asked LeBron to carry that burden for him now. And i know of no one more equipped to carry on Kobe's legacy than LeBron James.  RIP Mamba"
"I realize not everyone watches basketball or sports in general. With that being said, people should know what Kobe looks like. The media confuses black people with one another more than you think. What is shit reporting? Not knowing the details of who Kobe Bryant’ and Lebron James are? Or existing in a space that allows you to work for a news agency but can’t tell the difference between 2 of the most famous black men on the planet.   The point I’m saying. If there was a black person in the room this wouldn’t of happened.  As for your family. You don’t have to follow a stereotype to be considered black. That’s a dangerous way of thinking. However, it will suit them well to be informed. They should know what the fuck he looks like too.   Kobe"
Here is the issue. It’s long been a source of irritation for people of color when it comes to  misidentify people of color in the media. Especially those who are held in such high regard. White celebrities don’t get confused with one another. But you want to have a debate and say confusing Kobe Bryant and Lebron James is the epitome of white privilege. White people can live in a completely white world and not know who the fuck Kobe Bryant is. But yet I know what Prince Harry looks like and could literally give 2 fucks.
23 definitely should be retired after MJ and FVV  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/295859-the-real-reason-lebron-james-plans-on-changing-his-number
"[Fletcher Thomas has quite a few.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV4QVZmYNtxNoQZs2IhloWw)  Whenever I want to watch full games, I also just search something like ‘LeBron James 2009 Full Game’ and lots of results pop up."
Marv Albert would probably say “RIP LeBron James”
"Before I became a diehard LeBron Fan, I followed the Lakers and Kobe. I remember playing with NBA Live 04 and loving Kobe and the Lakers that I played with them all the time. Kobe ignited my interest in playing basketball both digitally and physically. Whilst I don't have the firepower and big capabilities of what Kobe can do on the court, I just give it my best despite looking odd sometimes. Sometimes I get to the flow and remind myself of being Kobe.   Still, despite now I have a huge admiration of LeBron James, without Kobe's influence on Basketball, I might not have been a LeBron James fan. I might have another interest or sport that I could have invested time but still, I am in the Philippines. Basketball is in the heart and soul of every Filipino, we all love it and especially we all love Kobe.  Hope Kobe is balling over there in heaven. Rest easy, Mamba, as your legacy will remain as long as someone in this world loves basketball."
"When I was a kid, I wasn't much into basketball. I knew all the big names: LeBron James, Paul Pierce, Dwyane Wade, Kevin Garnett, etc. That was mostly because I was always watching SportsCenter.   But I loved the Lakers, and I adored Kobe Bryant. He made everything seem so effortless on the court. Whether he was firing up a 3-pointer with a hand in his face, driving to the basket on a seven-foot center, or lining up a free throw; there was an absolute poise to everything he did, as if he'd done it so much that it was less a feat of athletics and more an innate skill.   The only time of year I ever really watched basketball was the NBA Finals. My grandad and I would sit in front of the TV and watch whoever was playing, so I became intimately familiar with those late-2000s Lakers teams. Gasol, Fisher, Bynum, Walton, all of them. Those teams, and Kobe, are burned into my childhood memories. I remember being sad about the Celtics beating the Lakers, and I remember the joy I felt seeing Kobe hoist his 5th O'Brien Trophy a couple years later. That moment gave me goosebumps, something sports rarely does.   Of course, years later, I'd have that reaction again watching Kobe drop 60 on the Jazz in his last game.   I guess all of this is to say that this hurt to read. I was praying that it was fake, that it was some sick joke someone had called in. And then it wasn't, and part of my childhood rushed back to me and drove me to tears.   My grandad and I still watch the Lakers now, whenever we're both home for it. He tells me stories of all the Lakers from when he was younger: Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Gail Goodrich, Magic Johnson, James Worthy, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.   All of this is my long-winded way of saying that Kobe Bryant impacted me on a personal level when I was younger. I had both of his jerseys (24, in yellow and white). They are the only basketball jerseys I've ever owned.  RIP Kobe, and RIP to Gianna and the seven others who tragically lost their lives yesterday."
"It was a mistake with the footage. Even if whoever takes care of choosing the clips doesn't know what Lebron and Kobe look like, I'm sure they're able to read ""James"" all over Lebron's jersey in the footage. Unfortunate, sure, but let's not reach here"
&gt;I said this on draft night but if he avoids injuries he’s gonna be a mvp level player in the nba  DAMN!!!! Really going out on a limb with this prediction. Predicting the most hyped player since Lebron James will be an MVP level player is a crazy prediction
LeBron James

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true          shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

"No shot clock?  Marv would be like, ""LeBron has the ball. LeBron has been dribbling the ball for 10 minutes now. LeBron goes between the legs. LeBron walks the ball to the left side of the court. Now LeBron is slowly moving to the right side of the court. There's a double-team! LeBron Johnson gets past the double-team! LeBron Jackson is headed toward the rim! Lamar James slows down and is now dribbling the ball back to half court. LeBron Jordan has the ball. Stripped! LeBron James lost the ball!"""
"Yes, I do. Mavs have a top bench in the league and elite coach and gets credit for his teams success because he puts volume stats. Two years in a row now his on/off numbers are very mediocre. How many teams have ever had a +2.7 net rating bench and not made the playoffs? If any have, I would bet not many but I am pretty sure none. It is unheard of to have a bench that good. If Trae Young or Booker had that would be 6th seed too. Damian Lillard has a crap negative bench and they are struggling this year compared to every year where they are top 4 playoff team often. Luka elevates an 8th seed playoff team to a 6th seed but isn't doing a Lebron James style carrying of his team and doesn't deserve to be in the conversation of his caliber. Ayton on the other hand has had a huge impact on both sides of the ball but the team sucks besides Booker and a couple okay players."
"That didn’t happen, they asked Lebron before the interview and he said they could ask about it. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/04/18/tnt-blasted-for-asking-lebron-james-for-reaction-to-death-of-gregg-popovichs-wife/%3foutputType=amp"
"I know this is truly insignificant compared to the situation but how perfect would it be Lebron to carry on Kobe's legacy and get that win this season with the Lakers in his honor..  I just feel like something like that would bring everyone together, just seems so perfect after Kobe's final moments the other day with him congratulating James.  Prayers up for the Bryant family and the others who's loved ones were on board, can't imagine what they're going through right now."
His last tweet was about Lebron James passing him for 3rd most scoring player in the NBA
"Damn, including his daughter and another kiddo. RIP to the Black Mamba and the others.    Also, my gf just realized Kobe Bryant and LeBron James are entirely 2 different people."
"Man, some news reporters are *really* dumb...like use some goddamn common sense.  I mean, it's obvious they have very little seeing as they report that all daughters and Rick Fox died without even fact-checking, and creepily stalking LeBron James. But Jesus Christ...just stop and think for a second."
"Lakers were on a plane from Philadelphia they just landed at LAX. You know LeBron James is going to want to do something big as a tribute, not just a passing tweet."
"I dont watch basketball at all and maybe only know 4 players (Micheal Jordan, LeBron James, Curry? And Kobe Bryant) and he is one of them and that says enough."
This is terrible... Even crazier that his all time score record was beat only yesterday by LeBron James
LeBron was asked if he wanted to respond beforehand (which he agreed to) but nice try.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/04/18/tnt-blasted-for-asking-lebron-james-for-reaction-to-death-of-gregg-popovichs-wife/%3foutputType=amp
"The last basketball game he ever watched was between his hometown Sixers and the team he played for his entire career, where he was passed by Lebron James in career points.  Life is weird and cruel."
"Ok he's literally as sculpted as LeBron james, you're fucking right my guy"
I wonder how Lebron is holding up right now given his last post dedicated to James
Prime Dwight beat Lebron James on the finals conference.  I'd take Current Dwight over Prime boogie not even lying.
"It’s like they all came out of hiding and are now just taking a fat shit all over our previously civilized subreddit.   I swear there weren’t half this many lakers fans 3 years ago.   *LeBron finishes a simple transition dunk*  *gets upvoted 100000000 times*   *Lakers fans* “I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass.”"
I have a hard time feeling bad for the Mavericks when they have a 20 year old Lebron James on their team.
"Fuck, looking at posts from the past 24 hours about Kobe is so sad.  16 hours ago on /r/nba: [Kobe Bryant] via twitter: Continuing to move the game forward @ KingJames. Much respect my brother.  20 hours ago on /r/nba: Kobe Bryant isn't upset that LeBron James will pass him on the NBA's all-time scoring list."
I can't believe it. The day after Lebron James surpassing him in the scoring record and the message Lebron put on his shoes... so eerie
Essentially the best player that was the bridge from Michael Jordan and LeBron James. LeBron has actually just passed Kobe for 3rd in all time scoring last night
"Top 10 for the last 30 years? That covers Michael Jordan for a start. LeBron James is already a bigger name worldwide than Kobe. Hell, Rodman's up there if we're just talking 'personalities'. And this is just basketball. If we're talking global sporting figures, Kobe is pretty far down the list.  Edit: It should go without saying that Kobe's death is tragic. Doesn't change the fact that he is not in the top 10 of sports personalities of the last 30 years."
LeBron James  Not because of his character but because we found out. LeBron seems like the type of guy who would  that under wraps
No I meant the extension he gave Iguodala  Its $15m for 20/21 season and another $15m team option for 21/22. Why the fuck would he extend a guy who just arrived on a trade but isn't named Lebron James or Dwyane Wade
"DeRozan is not and was never a great player, and NBA offenses were significantly different and less efficient in Wade's peak. You're advocating that Simmons should try to go down the hardest road. To be good enough from midrange to justify taking midrange shots is a way harder, rarer thing than to be good enough from 3. Pretty much only all time great shooters are that good from midrange. Wade was great in spite of his lack of ~~midrange~~ 3 point range. HE was great because he was incredible at attacking the basket, and he was great at so many other things... a monster defensively, a great rebounder and playmaker.  edit: Make no mistake though that a huge part of why the Heat lost to Dallas is because neither Lebron nor Wade could make 3s.  Many NBA players came in with no 3 point shot and learned one in the league... Jason Kidd, Lebron James, Mike Conley, D'Aaron Fox, Jae Crowder... lots more. It's not rare."
"Here's my take on prime  When you're younger your athletic prime is at it's physical top peak but the mental part is at it's lowest peak  At some point your mental peak will be higher while your physical peak is lower, this is usually when players have like 2-3 yrs left realistically  Your actual prime is that short moment when BOTH the physical and the mental peak are at the very same peak  For example a young Lebron James against current Lebron James  The young Lebron would be faster, can jump higher, has more stamina etc over the current Lebron James but where the current Lebron James would have the edge is the mental part of the game, knowing the best places on the floor to go to work, and things the young Lebron wouldn't know because the experience that comes with time just isn't there  I can't say for sure an exact age where the prime physically and prime mentally are in equilibrium but I'd venture to say some where between 26-29, I think that's a fairly nice range gap since as well know human beings are not robots so we experience things just slightly different  For instance we all know when puberty typically starts for most people, but then you hear about some people where it started a little bit early and some where it started just slightly later etc"
Everyone is making their pick on who the most famous player will be but I don't think it will be anyone currently in the NBA.  Lebron still has a few more years left and will be the face until he retires.  In a few years someone will come in hyped as the next Lebron James and he will take off.
"I mean, he's probably right. Look at the last 20 number 1 overall picks.  2019 = Zion: Jury is still out because he has played so little, but he looks like a future star.  2018 = Ayton: Putting up good numbers, but is on a bad team so he doesn't stand out. But 18 and 12 isn't anything to sneeze at in your 2nd year.  2017 = Fultz: Bust/Role Player  2016 = Simmons: All-Star Caliber player  2015 = KAT: All-Star Caliber player  2014 = Wiggins: Ok player. Role player.   2013 = Bennett: Bust  2012 = Davis: All-Star, All-NBA player  2011 = Kyrie: All-Star, All-NBA player  2010 = Wall: Former All-Star caliber player, just bad injuries recently  2009 = Griffin: Former All-Star, All-NBA player  2008 = Rose: Former MVP, All-Star, All-NBA player, derailed by injuries  2007 = Oden: Bust  2006 = Bargnani: Role Player  2005 = Bogut: Role Player  2004 = Howard: Former All-Star, All-NBA player, still in the league 15 years later  2003 = James: MVP, All-Star, All-NBA player  2002 = Ming: All-Star, All-NBA player derailed by injuries  2001 = Brown: Bust  2000 = Martin: Role player  So that's about 4 busts (Kwame Brown, Greg Oden, Anthony Bennett, and Markell Fultz), 4 role players (Kenyon Martin, Andrea Bargnani, Andrew Bogut, and Wiggins), 10 stars (Yao Ming, Lebron James, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, KAT, Simmons), and 2 that have good potential to be stars (Ayton and Zion). That's in the 10-12 aka 50-60% range of stars at the #1 overall pick."
"# Ex-Heat guard Dion Waiters reportedly might be moving onto greener pastures  February 10, 2020 04:06 PM  Dion Waiters speaks to local media for first time since suspensions  Heat guard Dion Waiters speaks to the local media on Jan. 26, 2020 for the first time since serving three suspensions this season. By Anthony Chiang  As the popular adage goes, “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure.” Such is the case with Dion Waiters and the Los Angeles Lakers.  ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Sunday night that the Lakers are expected to have [“an exploratory conversation”](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28667815/sources-darren-collison-return-nba-season-interest-lakers-clippers) with Waiters. The [Memphis Grizzlies waived the former Heat guard](https://www.nba.com/grizzlies/news/memphis-grizzlies-waive-dion-waiters-200209) earlier that day.   The pivot to the former Heat guard comes after the Lakers struck out on Darren Collison who they unsuccessfully tried to recruit out of retirement. Acquiring Collison would’ve boosted a bench that lacks three-point shooting and ball handling.  A career 13 points per game scorer, Waiter is believed to be the Lakers’ next best option. The Grizzlies acquired the nine year veteran as part of [the Andre Iguodala trade](https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nba/miami-heat/article240011998.html) after his [tumultuous season in Miami](https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nba/miami-heat/article239646408.html) that included three suspensions and dozens of DNPs.   Although Waiters’ career 35 percent shooting from deep leaves much to be desired, there is cause for optimism. He hit [45 percent of his corner threes](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/waitedi01.html#2017-2020-sum:shooting)during his four years in Miami, which he’ll figure to get a lot of with LeBron James running the show. The Syracuse product also played [more than 50-percent of his minutes](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/waitedi01.html#pbp::none) last season at the point, according to Basketball Reference.   What makes this deal even more plausible is Waiters’ numerous connections to the Lakers. He shares an agent with James and Anthony Davis in Rich Paul of Klutch Sports. Lakers president and GM Rob Pelinka previously represented the Syracuse product as well.   Whether or not the Lakers brass believe Waiters can stay out of the headlines for his off-the-court antics is up for them to decide. With as close as that locker room has grown [over the past weeks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/01/29/grieving-lakers-say-kobe-bryants-death-has-brought-us-closer-together/), they’ll surely take the time to evaluate if bringing him in is even worth the hassle."
Someone trying to compare LeBron James to Bob Cousy. Literally impossible comparison
LeBron James will never surpass Kobe Bryant (RIP) because he has never won the dunk contest.
"They drafted way better than Cavs, who got 3 god damn 1st round picks in 4 years. They became relevant and won a championship purely because Cleveland happens to be the hometown of some guy named Lebron James."
Dude. His name (Lebron) literally means King. His name is King James lol it’s not a nickname
Lebron started calling himself king james in high school and everyone ran with it
"""and lebron james becomes the first player in NBA history to win two NBA championships against two team with regular season record records"""
But he didn't have any choice. This guy was one of the first to even be throwing behind the back passes. This is part of the reason why comparing players in the 60's to the 2000's is completely wrong. You can't compare Bob Cousy to LeBron James. It is impossible.
"#Giannis Antetokounmpo is being marketed to overtake LeBron James as the NBA’s most famous player. But the ‘Greek Freak’ is more focused on the ‘essence’ of basketball.    Giannis Antetokounmpo could probably drive your SUV from the back seat. He might be able to simultaneously open your fridge and microwave. He can definitely touch the rim without leaving his feet.    The “Greek Freak” has a wingspan of 7 feet, 3 inches.    And yet those in his corner want to expand his reach.    “We want to be the world’s team,” Bucks president Peter Feigin said, “led by the world’s player.”    The basketball world will descend upon Chicago for NBA All-Star Weekend. There will be parties, promotional events, hospital visits, media sessions, a skills challenge, a slam dunk contest, a 3-point shooting extravaganza and even an actual All-Star Game.    Antetokounmpo could do without all of it … expect for the game.    He is so serious about basketball — even a defense-optional exhibition that doesn’t count in the standings — he debated conducting his pregame routine in Milwaukee before a drive down I-94 to the United Center.    “We had serious discussions,” agent Alex Saratsis said.    Antetokounmpo only relented once Saratsis, a Northwestern alumnus and Lincoln Park resident, promised he’d secure a quality gym in Chicago for Antetokounmpo’s Sunday afternoon sweat.    “And then he will go and play hard,” Saratsis said, “to the point where teammates have told him: Chill out.”    Antetokounmpo is so serious about basketball, he didn’t sound entirely thrilled about having received the most fan votes (more than 5.9 million) among Eastern Conference players. That tally made him team captain for the second straight year, requiring him to draft players.    “If I’m the captain, I’m the captain,” he said. “But by being the captain, you have more things to do and it takes away from the game. I don’t like things that take away from the game.”    And therein lies the conundrum for those pushing Antetokounmpo to overtake LeBron James as the sport’s most famous player: What if he doesn’t want to be the face of the NBA? Or he’s simply ambivalent?    “In five years he might say: I make ‘X’ amount from the Bucks, I make ‘Y’ amount from Nike; I’m good,” Saratsis said. “How much money does anyone need in a lifetime? For him it’s not about being a power broker. He doesn’t want a production company. He cares about family, people close to him and basketball.”  The Bucks (45-7 heading into Monday night’s game in Sacramento) have lost only once since Jan. 8. They held off the Celtics on a 40-point night from Kemba Walker. They beat the Bulls as Antetokounmpo scored his 10,000th career point and enjoyed his 18th career triple double (28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists). They beat the Hornets in Paris.    Seven days later they were back home at Fiserv Forum, the glistening House That Giannis Built, for a special occasion: Greek Night.    The Bucks distributed a bobblehead of Giannis and teammate Thanasis Antetokounmpo, the older brother Giannis hugged moments after the Bucks made him the 15th pick in the 2013 NBA draft. Thanasis wears 43 to mirror Giannis’ 34 jersey.    Coach Mike Budenholzer gave Thanasis his only start of the season, and he scored 62 seconds after the opening tip on a breakaway slam. He laid one in off a Giannis feed to give Milwaukee a 13-4 lead. The Bucks’ bench and sellout crowd went nuts.    But long story short, the Nuggets shot 22 of 46 (47.8%) on 3-pointers and stunned the Bucks 127-115. It made for a quiet scene in the Bucks locker room, a Friday night that felt more like a Monday morning.    Peppering Antetokounmpo with non-basketball questions seemed even sillier than usual.    Asked how he has adjusted to the spotlight, the NBA’s reigning MVP replied: “To be honest I try not to think about it. I know my name might be out there, but I’ve never cared about that and don’t now.”     Told of Giannis’ comment that the captain’s duties might detract from his play during the All-Star Game, Thanasis understood. Of course he did.    The brothers are so attached that when Saratsis presented them with two hotel room keys shortly after Giannis was drafted, they looked at him quizzically. They explained that they had never slept in separate rooms. Even adjoining hotel rooms didn’t provide enough closeness.    “(Giannis) is all about the essence,” Thanasis said. “How he practices will translate to the game.”    Though Antetokounmpo doesn’t seek fame, it finds him. He has the NBA’s second most popular jersey after James and ahead of Stephen Curry. He has more than 7.2 million Instagram followers, which ranks 11th in the NBA and first among international players.    Although Antetokounmpo plays in one of the NBA’s five smallest markets, Feigin said he could make the case that the 6-11 forward is actually the league’s most famous player.  Where else other than Greece?    “If you did a survey in Paris,” the Bucks’ executive replied cleverly, “he might win.”    Saratsis, his agent, said that given that Antetokounmpo’s parents are Nigerian, he “touches two continents. Europe has a massive immigrant population, and his story resonates with so many people. He has blazed a new trail with fans that are immigrants and have multinational parents.”    Antetokounmpo, 25, partnered with Nike in 2017 and last year became the first European-born player to have a signature Nike shoe — the Zoom Freak 1.    Don’t expect to see him doing ads for Binny’s or Majestic Star Casino while he’s in Chicago this weekend.    “We look at it as quality over quantity,” Feigin said. “What are the right spots? We want to market him as a global brand. It’s not ubiquity, it’s not everywhere, anyway, anyhow. How do we make things special?”    Antetokounmpo is scheduled to appear at Water Tower Place at 3 p.m. Saturday for a panel discussion with hip-hop artist Swoope, a fellow JBL ambassador. They will explore the intersection of basketball and music.    On Sunday he’ll be the focal point of Team Giannis, a captain who selected Walker, Joel Embiid, Pascal Siakam and Trae Young to round out his starting five. Last year Team Giannis lost 178-164 despite his game-high 38 points in 27 minutes.    Then he will return to his comfort zone of Milwaukee, a bright light in a city without all that many.    “I think he really enjoys life here,” veteran wing Kyle Korver said. “I don’t think he’s doing this well because he’s in a small market. I think he could flourish anywhere. But with his upbringing and how he thinks, he wants to keep the main things the main things — his family and the game.”    Teddy Greenstein   Note: fuck the censors."
"Daryl Morey - China  Lebron James - Response to Morey’s comments regarding China  The person you responded to said “*politics* is a fuckin shit show” so while the above examples don’t exactly translate to China, I think they’re examples of politics being a “fuckin shit show”"
That's certainly more stacked if you look at the pure stats but I wouldn't bet against a team with both LeBron James and Steph Curry on it.
 Assuming everyone is healthy and wants to play here is my 12:    Bam Adebayo    AD    Lebron James    Kevin Durant    Paul George    Kawhi Leonard    Jimmy Butler    Bradley Beal    James Harden    Russell Westbrook    Steph Curry    Damian Lillard

"As much as i would like to see a starting lineup of Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis, i hope Bron skips it to rest."
"R1: Portland with prime LaMarcus Aldridge (top 20 player), Brandon Roy  R2: Lakers with Kobe Bryant (top 5 player), Pau Gasol (top 20 player), Andrew Bynum (top 25 player), Lamar Odom (top 50 player), Phil Jackson  R3: OKC with Kevin Durant (top 5 player), Russell Westbrook (top 20 player), James Harden (top 50 player), Serge Ibaka (top 50 player)  Finals: Miami Heat with LeBron James (Best Player in NBA), Dwyane Wade (top 10 player), Chris Bosh (top 30 player)  That's got to be the hardest route to the finals in recent memory. 2x defending champs in round 2?"
"That's just not fair, FIBA should make a rule that says each state has to enter separately.   Like imagine if a middle-of-nowhere state has to play against Serbia or Canada. I'm talking a fly over state like Ohio, they'll need to play a team of:  Steph Curry  CJ McCollum  Lebron James  Caris LeVert  Larry Nance Jr  Bench:  Terry Rozier  Luke Kennard  ...  Fuck"
"Small anecdote but I think most people can reiterate this:  If I go next door to the office that has eight women all over 40 and ask them if they know LeBron James, they're all going to say yes. If I ask them about Giannis, they'll most likely have no idea who I'm talking about."
"Stephen Curry Kawhi Leonard Kevin Durant LeBron James Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard James Harden Klay Thompson Paul George Bam Adebayo  Barring injuries these are the first 10 players I would go with. The last two spots are tough as hell and I would probably go with either Westbrook, Lowry or Butler for 1 spot and Draymond, Harrell or Howard for the other.   Regardless I really want to see the starting 5 of Curry, Bron, Whi, KD and AD share the floor together."
"My ideal squad right now, before injuries and drop outs:  C Anthony Davis - Bam Adebayo PF LeBron James - Paul George - Draymond Green SF Kevin Durant - Klay Thompson SG Kawhi Leonard - James Harden  PG Steph Curry - Chris Paul - Damian Lillard"
Full-list. Maybe a little easier to read this way:  1.	Bam Adebayo – Heat  2.	LaMarcus Aldridge – Spurs  3.	Harrison Barnes – Kings  4.	Bradley Beal – Wizards  5.	Devin Booker – Suns  6.

"PG: Lillard, Westbrook, Lowry, Kyrie, Curry, and CP3. Rose is not a lock right now, but if he finishes his career strongly, I could see getting in.   SG: Klay Thompson, Vince Carter, and James Harden.   SF: LeBron, KD, Kawhi, and Carmelo. PG is not a lock yet.   PF: Love, Draymond, and AD. Possibly Giannis after this year.   C: Dwight"
"Maybe because Kyrie has a history of saying dumb shit and he has nowhere near the clout as Lebron fucking James. One is the greatest player of his era. The other thinks dinosaurs are fake. Maybe instead of calling teammates out by name, he should work on not being so socially inept."
"Ever heard of a thing called sample size? One game winning shot doesn't make a player a high impact player.  Lots of people win games when LeBron James is their teammate. He made Moe Williams an All Star, and got guys like Tristan Thompson, Matthew Delavadova and Daniel Gibson overpaid. Every non-LeBron team Kyrie has ever been a part of has underachieved with him in the lineup. Then, when he leaves, or his out of the lineup, they overachieve. The Celtics made the Conference Finals when he was injured, and turned into a dysfunctional mess when he returned. Then, he left town and now they are overachieving again.  His Nets have a better record with him out of the lineup this year, and are under .500 with him in the lineup, despite being an over .500 team last year when D'Lo was in that spot. Even with the Cavs, they lost in the Finals his last year there, then he left, they replaced him with the injured ghost of IT, and they made it right back to the Finals.   ...but Kyrie made a shot one time, so we should just ignore the rest of his career, right?"
"I would still go with my line up to beat yours all day;  PG - John Stockton  SG - Michael Jordan  SF - LeBron James  PF - Dirk Nowitzki  C - Shaquille O'Neal  Stockton - I already have an scorer who wants the ball in his hands, Stockton a great playmaker and defense oriented old school PG can switch it up not to mention get dirty from time to time to win plays. A very underrated shooter as well who can hit the 3 when needed.  Jordan - Yeah, no explanation needed.  LeBron - Not a LBJ fan but the dude is sometimes underrated with the career he has. He just makes everyone better and with him in the team you have a player that can run at teams like a freight train or be an alternative PG to make plays for everyone.  Nowitzki - It's a difficult decision whether to add Dirk or Timmy (Duncan), but I go with Dirk so I'll have a stretch 4 to open up the lanes and be a threat both in and out as well.  Shaq - Well, because he'll fuck everyone up lol"
"&gt;""It's like when you don't have bodies. It's tough,"" James said. ""The f---ing grind of the regular season. We're a top-heavy team. We have a top-heavy team. We top-heavy as s---.

lol Booker would literally have to be LeBron James
The guy actually went to LeBron James' school of bitching and moaning in social media.
"From my count, he went 10/7/3 in the 4th. He only played 10 minutes. He's crazy in the 4th lmao.  Edit: Just looked it up, here's the list of players averaging at least 7 points in the 4th quarter (in order from most to least)  James Harden  Trae Young  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Ja Morant  LeBron James  Zion Williamson  Damian Lillard  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal   4th Quarter Ja is amazing."
They only review it if it's really obvious or a popular star like Lebron James wanted them reviewed... Seen it so many time.
"Nah it was Love, Bron admitted so after the fact. https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12299557/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-fit-tweet-was-reference-kevin-love   Love talked more about it this year too: https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/kevin-love-calls-lebron-james-160001095.html"
Lmao why’re you guys using Randle like he’s LeBron James?
"He cites one matchup against the rockets where gobert struggles. That's a somewhat unique matchup with harden and the uber spacing of the rockets. Gobert will be a massive force against the clippers and lakers.   The way he talks about the stats shows he doesn't know anything about basketball. He linked only raw per game numbers. Gobert is 6th in the league in 538s raptor all in one metric, right behind doncic. He's 4th in pipm right behind lebron James. He's consistently painted as an mvp caliber player by metrics that factor in defense. I'm not saying he's that good but it's clear his defensive impact is monumental.   Now if you want to debate his effectiveness against Houston or golden state in the playoffs be my guest. But plenty of great players, even hall of fame players have been neutralized in bad match ups in the playoffs.   This guy who wrote this post is clearly some type of hater"
"Whenever Rudy Gobert is brought up it always makes me think of [this article from The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/2018/4/6/17204586/rudy-gobert-utah-jazz-defensive-player-of-year) back in 2018, specifically this quote.   &gt; Every team in the NBA understands the inherent weaknesses that Gobert affixes to team defense, but they rear an ugly head only when a team is talented enough to take him out of his comfort zone without giving up any clear advantage on the opposite side of the ball.  He is *obviously* a great defensive player that when the tempo is allowed to be set by Utah and it's an ordinary game, he dominates and shows why he's been the DPOY in back to back years and likely 3peat it this year.   However, teams can abuse him come playoffs like we've seen before to the point Utah has to bench him because he's such a liability in the final minutes of games.  ------------------  Some more quotes/Twitter videos showing what the article is talking about.  On the Warriors series  &gt; [In seven seconds, Steph Curry dissolved the veneer of Gobert’s impenetrable defense by dragging him out into deep space.](https://twitter.com/SLAMonline/status/859614966365728773?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E859614966365728773&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theringer.com%2F2018%2F4%2F6%2F17204586%2Frudy-gobert-utah-jazz-defensive-player-of-year) The Warriors brought up a double-screen with Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala, who attached themselves to Boris Diaw and Dante Exum, respectively, forcing Gobert to pick up the Curry assignment at the 3-point line. The Stifle Tower does two complete circles in space before losing both Curry and his sense of time and place altogether. It wasn’t even halftime of Game 1, but it was clear that the Jazz could never recover from that. It was an existential tailspin that rendered itself literally in real time  On the Rockets series (videos no longer available).  &gt; The lineup that ruined the Jazz that particular night? Harden and Paul surrounded by Joe Johnson, Trevor Ariza, and Luc Mbah a Moute. Together, the cabal of perimeter-oriented players no taller than 6-foot-8 ran a clinic on how to take Gobert out of the game.  &gt; The Rockets drew inspiration from that Curry play from last year, running what might be a playful variant of D’Antoni’s “52” action, where a screen from a center is followed a beat later by a decoy screen by the shooting guard just behind him, freeing up the ball handler for a drive, the center for a layup, or the shooting guard for a 3. In the play above, the 5 and 2 screen simultaneously, but in reality, it’s all a misdirection: The screens weren’t meant for Paul, they were meant for Harden and Mbah a Moute to casually switch assignments. Gobert, misreading the play out near the arc, frantically calls for Joe Ingles’s attention on Harden, but as the Aussie’s head swivels, Mbah a Moute shoots out of a cannon for a dunk on a perfect pocket pass from Harden.  &gt; The Rockets, who were incredibly rude all game, ran the same action two plays later:   &gt; This time, the play was meant to set Paul up with the Gobert mismatch. But the Rockets conspicuously running the same play was psychologically manipulative—they were giving Gobert a taste of his own medicine. Faced with indecision, Gobert dropped back and then lost his balance on a closeout, allowing Mbah a Moute to get all the way to the rim, again.  ---------------------------------------------------------  &gt; At their worst, they are also completely beholden to Gobert’s influence. What happens when a playoff team can routinely exploit Gobert on the perimeter? He is too central to the entire team’s operations to sit out, but he’s also too ill-equipped to handle five-out lineups regularly. It’s an existential question on par with the one that has faced all Eastern Conference challengers in the shadow of LeBron James. There isn’t a convenient answer. The Jazz are putting the finishing touches on one of the most remarkable in-season turnarounds in recent memory and are performing at a level that deserves your attention. Over the past three months, they’ve been an elite team. As such, expectations have to be raised. Utah can stand tall against every team in the NBA. But its Achilles’ heel is as exposed as it’s ever been."
"Face of the NBA, biggest name in sports, Lakers star etc etc.   Don’t get me wrong, I love lebron James. But he’s turning himself to more of a brand everyday and that’s kinda getting annoying. Like I get it, get your bag, but c’mon man you already have more money than the children of your children could ever need."
"I've said the same thing. People who didn't even watch sport, hated Lebron James. Bro, Osama Bin Laden's translator said Lebron was [a bad man](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/osama-bin-ladens-translator-wanted-lebron-james-to-apologize-to-cleveland/) for what he did to Cleveland.   That's why i laugh when i see guys here say *This player's legacy will be tarnished forever!*   Lol, yeah, not how it works."
"To begin, Why he needed to speak to the crowd? I understand that they were cool with each other, but they were not best friends or was really part of Kobe’s life outside of basketball and NBA. It would’ve made more sense if Pelinka, Jerry West, Fisher, or even fucking Shaq or Phil Jackson had spoken, but why second lebron “straight from the heart” James?"
Trade LeBron and AD for james dolan
"How I think it will shake out:  PG: Damian Lillard, Kemba Walker, Kyrie Irving  SG: James Harden, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown  SF: Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Khris Middleton  PF: Jayson Tatum, Brandon Ingram, Montrezl Harrell  C: Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Myles Turner    I think LeBron, Steph, etc. will ultimately drop out.

Lebron James.
"James Harden easily is one of the best offensive guards/wing players ever, right up there with Kobe, Lebron and Magic and just below Jordan. It's funny no one seems to talk about him this way."
"&gt;	is number one seed in the west, the historically tougher division  &gt;	has lebron  &gt;	had AD, a DPOY contender and strong favorite   &gt;	has goddamn fucking LEBRON JAMES  &gt;	disaster  you are as big of moron as the patrick mahomes &gt; curry guy"
"You guys are really digging yourself a hole with the Lakers are done talk. Yeah I agree we have some weaknesses, but I wouldn't write off a team with Lebron James and Anthony Davis. Clippers may be deeper, but we still have 2 top 5 players in the league.  If we win a championship, what will the doubters say then?"
Not even LeBron James could turn into LeBron James against you guys
"Ahh, so Clarkson is the gamely bench player to turn into Lebron James against us. Cool"
"ROY.  Joins Luka Doncic, LeBron James, and De'Aaron Fox as the only 20 years old or younger to record a triple double with at least 27 points."
Better than LeBron James
"Steph has never been the best player in the league because Lebron James exists, who is significantly better at his sport than Mahomes is at his. It's not a fair comparison. Mahomes is playing in a weird time where the old generation of QBs are nearing retirement and the new generation hasn't been established yet. Mahomes wouldn't be the best QB if he were playing against a prime Rodgers, Brady, and Brees."
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2615691-kobe-bryant-comments-on-relationship-with-lebron-james
I mean they literally signed LeBron James lol
"1. LeBron James 630 wins 2. Serge Ibaka 571 wins  You can't argue with numbers, my good man."
"Trae Young, Ja Morant, James Harden, Lebron, Kawhi, AD, KD, Steph... this list could go on."
"Yes. Yes I do. I don't know if other people disagree, but for a long time the highest percentage 3 point shooters were usually made up of role players. Kyle Korver. JJ Reddick. Anthony Morrow. Still pretty common even know. The thing that made Curry was so ridiculous was his volume while keeping up with role players like that. LeBron James in 2012 was considered crazy/ridiculous for being a superstar SF shooting 60% for a while because that's role player center numbers.  You do expect role players to convert at a higher rate than superstars because they have less pressure and usually higher probability attempts. Terence Davis has the highest 3PT% on your team. Does that mean Siakam isn't an All-Star? Six players on your team have a higher FG% than Siakam, should he pass more? Lowry as well as he's below Siakam in both cases."
Lebron “Kyrie Irving” James
Lebron James
LeBron James (3) and his son Steph Curry. (3)
"That’s not true.   Lebron’s decision was basically made on the day of the decision.   Bosh verbally agreed with  the heat before James   Lebron was making sure  he was in the best situation to win a ring.   No, Wade and Lebron wanted to play years before  the actual transition. That doesn’t mean he was definitely going to the Heat  This is revisionist history.   Lebron wanted to go to a team with the easiest chance of winning a ring.   After finding out Bosh and Wade teamed up, did he make the decision."
NBA has listened to the narrative. Lebron James must be pushed as the MVP and they're coming after Giannis 1 point at a time to make it happen.
And LeBron had already agreed with Wade he was going to the Heat before the decision. It’s all by the by anyway - LeBron and Wade had already agreed to play with each other years ago. They initially wanted Melo to take the same deal (3 years) James to become a free agent and those 3 could join up. Melo didn’t want to leave money on the table and it became Bosh instead.
Hey it got us LeBron James and AD. I’m good too.
I feel like Lebron James of all people has earned the benefit of doubt of not being judged based on his performances in the middle of the regular season.
Lebron James probably isn’t even in the top 10 of mvp candidates this season.
It's from the following article:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2875487-lebron-james-explains-unintended-dunk-tribute-to-kobe-bryant-comparison-video
"Lebron James is my favorite player. He has been since I started watching basketball in 2009. He’s (arguably) the greatest player of all time. His passing this season has been legendary. But he absolutely does not deserve MVP at this point. His efficiency has dropped significantly this season, and his defense has been painful. He never gets back on fast breaks because he’s complaining about not getting foul calls (he has been getting shit calls significantly more when driving to the basket this season)."
"&gt; She said that there are people saying that the Kobe tragedy contributes to Lebron's MVP race narrative  But there really aren’t. She’s inventing that narrative while simultaneously acting as if she isn’t generating it. The media indulges in this all the time, where the media generates a narrative and then feels justified in reporting/discussing the narrative because it’s “out there”.   The problem is that it’s like a perpetual motion machine. Who needs news when you can just invent it and then report/a discuss the rumor you yourself invented!  Kobe passing was not impacting the Lebron James MVP race. You won’t find that discussed say, here on reddit or amongst fans or players. But now that Rachel “some people say” Nichols has “reported” (invented) it, now all of the media can latch onto it (even if it’s to say “how dare Rachel Nichols!”). Hours of content will be generated and it *will* be a narrative now  But it wasn’t organic and in fact likely cynically generated for the exact purpose it’ll serve, generating new content."

Bro. It’s LeBron James
James Harden Lebron
Lebron James Harden
We got to make a survey for math and it due monday so name favorite out of  Luka Doncic James Harden Lebron James Other
"I will never forget that game tying three that OG made. Incredible shot that tied that game and nearly capped a pleasantly surprising comeback - too bad LeBron one-upped him with that game winning runner right afterwards.  (You know LeBron attempted that shot just to fuck with OG too. That was a ""I'm LeBron fucking James"" shot right there.)"
"Hate to be the party pooper, but he probably would have finished it had it not been for this - https://imgur.com/a/WvNPasm (there's 3 pics).  I know some buzz-cut scrub from Europe who looks like your local bouncer probably couldn't take off from there, but he's a professional athlete, nobody takes off from a place they know they can't get at least close to, which is what raised my suspicions.   After slowing the video down, you can see that his defender not only touches his rising leg, but literally grabs, grips and pulls it down. Not even LeBron James could finish that dunk with someone grabbing his rising leg to the floor with their bodyweight. If you look at the original video in real-time, it looks like a video-game glitching when he takes off."
Uh he literally clamped up LeBron lmfao. As in Prime LeBron James. Bron was literally dreading him coming off the bench because he gave him so many problems. And dude Kawhi is the best two way player in the NBA.
Hot take incoming!  LeBron James is good at basketball
"We have lebron James whose teams have always played their worst in January-all star break for the past like 5 years. Oh yeah he’s also the 3rd best player of all fucking time at worst. A guy who has stepped up his play in the playoffs to another level for almost a decade.   But we don’t get any benefit of the doubt at all. I’m fine with it, but shit on the clippers too."
Vogel really turned LeBron James into a spot up shooter with his weird ass lineups
So you're paying a max contract for a number 2 option  Meanwhile the Lakers pay a max contract for LeBron James and the Warriors pay a max contract for Steph Curry   You don't see the inherent disadvantage here?
"It's like he's up there with the ball, going left, and he's like ""oh yeah, right, I'm LeBron James!"" And splashes it"
&gt;Originated from a LeBron quote.     &gt;   &gt;[https://www.slamonline.com/archives/lebron-james-jr-smith-cavaliers-f-king-squad-now/](https://www.slamonline.com/archives/lebron-james-jr-smith-cavaliers-f-king-squad-now/)
Kyle “LeBron James” Kuzma
"As an IT fan, I appreciate Isaiah Thomas being in the same conversation as Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan/Manu Ginobili, and Dirk Nowitzki, but let's be real.  He's not quite a cornerstone player like those guys, and even without a devastating injury (none of which those guys had except Kobe at the *real end* of his career - and the Lakers were **not** winning during that stretch), it never made sense for the Celtics to max him.  They also traded him to a team with LeBron James, who was just a year removed from winning a championship against the 73-win Warriors. It's not like he got sent him to a bad team."
"Yeah but you could likely tune the sensitivity, and have the calls be both consistent and impartial. An AI ref isn’t going to be afraid to make a critical call against a Greg Popovich or a Lebron James."
"Shut the fuck up lmao. What kind of argument is saying Jordan won rings with Harper while failing to mention everyone else that was a major contributor to their success? Oh LeBron won with Chalmers but let's conveniently ignore Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade. Every championship team has end of bench players or even players who play 20+ minutes that aren't ***that*** depending on how the roster is constructed. The 2016-17 Warriors won a ring with Ian Clark, James Micheal McAdoo, JaVale McGee, Anderson Varejão and sharpshooter Matt Barnes shooting a blistering 43% from the field and 32% from 3-point land. 🔥 And how is it throwing shade if everyone with eyes knows what he's saying is correct? How many times over the last 5 years have the media and casual fans alike said that OKC's roster construction didn't play to either of their stars' strengths?  ""Yeah, let's build a team around a player who can collapse a defense at will by attacking the basket and kicking out but don't give him any shooters."" Not to mention he's stated before his intention to join GS was talked about and mulled over for years. Was he just supposed to cancel those plans and re-up with the Thunder because they happened to match up against us in the playoffs? If the Thunder had lost to the Mavericks or Spurs prior to meeting us in the WCF would there still be a problem with him signing with us?"
May I introduce you to LeBron James and the 2007 Cavaliers
LEBRON JAMES WITH THE REJECTION
That was always a weird narrative because how can you consider losing to lebron fucking James (and kyrie and love) a choke job?
"you can have both thought  boston traded for kg and allen but pierce was drafted as well as rondo (not that impactful in 2008 but helped take them to the finals in 2010 as  an all star)  dirk was far and away their most valuable player in 2011 and he was drafted, barea was homegrown (signed as undrafted there in 2006) too amd technically kidd was a drafted player i guess (doesnt count for the purpose of this thread but neat fact)  for cavs kirye and thompson (meme all you want but he was key in that championship) were homegrown and lebron james wouldnt have been there if nor for being drafted by cleveland in tbe first place, not to mention getting wiggins in 2014 allowed to get love  2006, 2012, 2013 heat  they drafted wade  lakers got kobe in the draft   yes team with cores made almost entirely of drafted players are rare but so are those made only of trades and free agents  not to mention the teams you listed account for nearly half o the last 30 championships in the first place"
They have been making a mockery of this sort all year in regards to Lebron James. The dude drives the lane and gets hacked again and again with no calls. It has never been this bad in his whole career. Loom at his free throw attempt numbers this year. Even with his sub par free throw percentage if he got half the calls he should be getting the Lakers would be winning and controlling more games.    Refs fucking suck at their jobs.
"I just don’t like your fan base. I think the Jazz banter is fun and Lakers banter is fun but for some reason blazer fans just always have a thousand excuses for getting beat, get beat and bring up past events, and have garbage mean hot takes(Jokic sucks, Gobert is shit, OuR wHoLe FrOnT CoUrT iS hUrT so this doesn’t mean shit)   Y’all 5 games under .500 but act like you’re a top 3 seed and Dame is Lebron James, I’m sorry but I just can’t stand it."
"I think Gary Payton, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Dirk Nowitzki, David Robinson, and Kevin Garnett as the 6th man is the best possible line up considering fit, spacing, and chemistry."
Says the guy with [NBA] LeBron James as his flair lol
PG - Steph Curry  SG - James Harden  SF - Michael Jordan  PF - Larry Bird  C - LeBron James  6th Man - Allen Iverson  Coach:  Lawrence Frank
"""Pascal Siakam is better than LeBron James, and is arguably the GOAT. 2nd at worst."" - u/Defences"
"&gt;Yeah but will he show up?  Remember last season when he said ""playoff mode activated"", then preceded to go 2-5, and get punked/ran off the court by Patrick Beverley? &gt; &gt;&amp;#x200B; &gt; &gt;It would be great to see that LeBron again.....but I'm not going to assume it's a given playing out West at age 35 after missing the playoffs for the first time since his sophomore season.  I mean, to be fair, LeBron James said that after he came back from a groin injury probably a little earlier than he should have. I don't think it's fair to judge LeBron James from last season after his groin injury. This goes for any NBA player coming back from an injury like that lol"
Um yea obviously? Whats the point of saying this. Zion is the most hyped prospect since lebron james so of course this is happening.  I don’t think he deserves to win it but it makes sense why people are trying to push these narratives
"Right he didn't completely make up that it happened, but to take it personally that Lebron James was making a punching motion towards him certainly is a fabrication."
"Hey guys, Peter Griffin from the hit comedy TV show, Family Guy, here to explain the joke. So basically, 2 very good NBA players, Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan, and also Lebron James and Zion Williamson, both combined for a certain amount of points in a game. In case you haven’t noticed, that funny number is 69 (nice!) But wait aminute, what’s so funny about a FREAKING number? Well, cringe normie, it’s actually the funny sex number! In case you don’t know what $ex is, it’s what me and my wife Lois do all the time (hehehehe). You see, the word “sixty-nine” almost sounds like the phrase “sex tonight,” and it also references a s*x position (please don’t tell Lois I watch pørn, she’ll be mad). You see, the 69 position involves both parters’ genetalia (it can work either male/female, male/male or female/female, but that’s more advanced and I’ll explain it another day.). The reason it’s called the 69 is because the number 6 looks like the view of a person on top with a slightly bent cock, and the number 9 is the number 6 upside down. Put them together, and it makes it look like they’re sucking off eachother’s dicks! Now that’s kinda gay. So that is why the 69 meme is funny and you may now laugh at this funny post. Now I think we can all agree that this is very epic!"

This ref is the new Joey Crawford  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Kane Fitzgerald is his name. Also known to be the ref who ejected Lebron James
"The Rondo problem is a big problem for the Lakers because their competition has better benches. Lou Williams is likely to destroy Rondo and DiVincenzo/Hill/Connaughton will too. In fact, they already have.   Lebron James was a +3 in the Lakers loss to the Clippers on Christmas for example. Everytime Lebron sits and Rondo subs in the Lakers lose their lead. If it keeps happening all season maybe it is something that shouldn't be ignored?"

Clear based on Frank Vogel and Jason Kidd and LeBron James knowing the game of basketball better and never putting Caruso out there as the primary ball handler against good pressure defenses
James Harden and Lebron James are point guards.
You know so far who has been a perfect person? LeBron James. 0 scandal. 0 bad press. All the accolades. All the praises. All the community work. We are extremely thankful that this man (not just a basketball player) is a Laker. I hope he will have an equally influential career post-NBA as Kobe did.    One thing about Kobe. He didn't just become an entrepreneur. He became a sage and a champion for rights and values. That's precious.
I know but that was by choice. They literally switched roles the next year. That's just how unselfish both Wade and James were and Lebron tried to step back again for Kyrie and now Ad because of his unselfishness and prioritizing winning not because he can't be the number 1 guy.  Lebron just wants to win and we almost won playing that way in 2011. It didn't work and so we tried the other way. Wade's stats went down but were winning with LJ running things so he got no criticism.
Lebron James flopping against his own teammate during a scuffle against the raptors
"If you're going to somehow perceive the statement ""basketball is more star driven than other sports"" as ""championships are regularly won by starless sports teams outside of basketball"" then, okay, I doubt you're gonna take kindly to my explanation, but here:  In 06-07 Lebron James did not even make the NBA first team yet, as the star of an otherwise abysmal team, he carried that squad to the actual finals.  Mike Trout, on the other hand, is by most metrics the greatest baseball player in human history. Yet his team hasn't made the playoffs in 6 years, and have only made it once in his decade long career. He is the greatest player of all time. Lebron at 22 brought carried his team to the finals, he was not even nearly the greatest of all time then"
Nope. Classic reddittors twisting words to fit whatever they need   Zion is more like Blake griffin than lebron James.. that’s what the original question is. Did you forget that?   But Zion being a confident shooter in his rookie year is a clear step above Blake’s rookie year. Wouldn’t you agree?
teams arent going to give bronny playtime just to appease a 40-year-old lebron james.
dunking before the age of 14 like lebron did is a sign of great physical potential. i think he will end up being 6'6 after a quick growth spurt in high school. max 6'8. and he would have had 18 years of experience training under lebron james. which is nothing to scoff at.
"It's debatable but even as a Celtics fan I don't think he is. Guys I have ahead of him that I think are locks (in no particular order): Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kareem, Magic. You can also debate Bill Russell and Wilt ahead of him but that's closer. No question top 10 but I have a hard time saying top 5 personally."
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. LeBron James  5. Kawhi Leonard
"Is it? LeBron's made connections and can find a GM to give him a shot for the sake of doing so.  It's not completely outside of the relam of possibility, the NBA is an entertainment league after all  Edit: also, do y'all know how many former players have son's in the G league or who legitimately get good shots at making the league? Happens all the time, and this is LeBron James we're talking here. If he looks like a decent player when the time arrives it's probably happening"
1. Lebron 2. Giannis 3. Damien Lilliard 4. James Harden 5. Russell Westbrook
"I think he’ll stay. I’m really happy with how close he’s gotten with the team and the influence he’s had.   Vogel said this about him recently:  [&gt;	On-the-bench trash talker... Yeah, he’s been that for us. He’s good with that. And he’s had a great pulse on what our group was going through. I remember there was a game where he challenged LeBron [James] at halftime to be more aggressive or something like that. He’s contributed to our culture, and we’re excited that he’s still going to be around in a different capacity while he’s going to be here rehabbing.""](https://www.si.com/nba/lakers/news/frank-vogel-says-demarcus-cousins-became-family)"
1. Giannas Antetetokounmpo   2. James Harden   3. Lebron James    4. Luka Doncic   5. Nikola Jokic
"Stop it. We just had 4 straight finals appearances and 1 championship. We had LeBron fucking James for 11 years. The Indians have been a borderline contender for a few years. And the Browns still have some young talent that they still have to put it together.  Cleveland sports fans know nothing of the misery Detroit sports fans have had lately. The Pistons trading for an expiring AI was the beginning of one of the worst eras in franchise history (arguably worst), the infamous Lions history, The Tigers have been rebuilding for years and are still the worst team in the MLB, and the Red Wings have been one of the worst teams in the NHL for a few years now after their 90s/2000s success."
"For guys who have played at least 300 minutes together, LeBron James and Alex Caruso lead the league in Net rating as a duo (+22.5). 8 out of the next 10 duos are a combination of Milwaukee Bucks.  but sure Caruso is not a good PG.  I get that you probably don't understand good basketball as a Timberwolves fan."
Most regular-season games falling one rebound short:  1. Magic Johnson — 46  2. Oscar Robertson — 43  3. Jason Kidd — 37  4. LeBron James — 26  5. Russell Westbrook — 23  6. Larry Bird — 19
Most regular-season games falling one assist short:  1. Larry Bird — 36  2. Wilt Chamberlain — 29  3. Oscar Robertson — 28  4. Kevin Garnett — 28  5. LeBron James — 25  6. Charles Barkley — 20
"AD seems to have lost his confidence in shooting since the ASB. Airballed his first two attempts, and proceeded to clank them throughout the game. Besides this, he was still able to get a double-double. That's great, but he needs to find his shot by the playoffs if the Lakers want to overcome the other contenders.  &amp;#x200B;  Lebron James did what we know he could do, so nothing surprising there. He really bullied Jrue the whole game, I was expecting some defensive switch coming out of halftime, but nothing really came of it.  &amp;#x200B;  The most impressive performance for me was Caruso. Dude came in and crushed it on the defensive end while also dishing out 8 assists. I think what really stands out from him is his BBIQ; he knows when to make the right plays and sometimes gets flashy with it. I really hope to see more of him during the playoffs alongside Bron bc their combined +/- doesn't lie."
Lebron James also does it As does Luke Kennard who is exactly like RJ. It’s uncommon but not unheard of.
Cue LeBron James Jr
Major outlier.....  Look at this year. Khris Middleton and Danilo Gallinari are more efficient scorers than Giannis.  Demar DeRozan is a more efficient scorer than Lebron James and Kawhi Leonard.
So you think Corey Maggette in 2010 was a more efficient scorer than Lebron James?
No that's not what it means.  It means he relied on getting a ridiculous amount of FTs while playing for a 26 win team in garbage time minutes for half the season.   Corey fkin Maggette was never a more efficient scorer than Lebron James at any point of his career. Who would even argue for that....really shows how much people here blindly follow advanced stats.
"We considering Lebron, Luka, Harden, or Jrue PGs? I'll say yes yes no no.  Bledsoe, Lowry, Simmons, Paul, Westbrook, Murray, DJM, Murray, Frank, Rubio, Brogdon, Lonzo, Satoransky, Ball, Conley, Fox  That's not even including the ones at the top if you want to sub in James for one for one of them."
"Well you're right, but probably not in the way you thought. I wasn't able to find stats from this year, but last season he shot 45% from 27 feet or deeper.  https://hoopshype.com/2019/02/20/los-angeles-lakers-lebron-james-scouting-report-analysis/"
"The Pelicans need to minimise Zion and Ingrams minutes together *for now*. Lineups with those two and Favors just don't make much sense as both need space to be at their best. Zion is still not very good defensively so I understand why they want Favors out there alongside him but eventually he's going to have to learn.  Also Jrue Holiday is ridiculously good. Even on a cold shooting night where he has to guard a *hot shooting* Lebron James he still gave maximum effort for 38 minutes. For those that watch him closely his communication, awareness, and effort on the defensive end are absolutely phenomenal and his playmaking offensively is still extremely good. He's the glue that holds the whole team together. Also with the way the lineups in New Orleans work he basically plays as a SF, at 6'4"", insane."

"This season? Look up the yearly total free throw attempt leaders for each of the last..let’s say... 5 years. Lebron hasn’t finished anywhere near the top. He hasn’t lived at the line since really his first Cleveland stint. Somewhere in Miami he stopped getting calls. There have been seasons where KD and Derozan have taken more than him, along with other finesse players like Lou Williams, Dame, etc. And this is a yearly thing.  James Harden attempts anywhere from 200-400 more free throws than Lebron EVERY SEASON. Westbrook takes hundreds of more as well usually. It’s been quite a while since Lebron was at the top. And just look at the 2018 finals when they reversed that charge call and gave it to KD, or the play before that when he stripped KD so cleanly and they called it.   I was looking at his shot chart vs Denver in that game before the all star break because people said Lebron was afraid to drive because he didn’t wanna go to the line. In that game he took 16 shots under the basket and only went to the line two times. It just don’t even make sense lol"
"You’re wrong man. These people live really interesting lives, more so than a doctor or accountant. They’re mega stars, known around the world and will be remembered for generations to come. Someone like Muhammad Ali was not a normal person. Lebron james is not a normal person. Kobe, MJ, Conor Mcgregor, Tom Brady, etc. These people live or lived really crazy lives. Most of us do our 9 to 5 nonsense for 25 years , retire and then die. Athletes live a totally different existence."
Giannis Antetokounmpo Or LeBron James?  Both of them have good performance. Defence and Offence.  Who do you think is the man.
"Big performance by LeBron James.  Anthony Davis makes up for a bad night of shooting, not a lot of defensive activity.  And what about Alex Caruso who brings incredible energy when he takes the field."
&gt;Alex Caruso and LeBron James are the only two Lakers in the top 30 of real plus minus. AD is the next closest at 81th.  &gt;AD is the next closest at 81th.  &gt;81th.  &gt;th
"I didnt said that he's getting the  ""superstar"" treatment here in america what I was saying is other basketball countries which are china, japan, and philippines were I see ads of him being ""the next big thing"" and i see him everywhere when I visited those countries and also people that I know there talks about him like he's lebron james"

Lebron James
"Today's game was bullshit and an anomaly but I don't see any other reasonable explanation. I doubt that the refs collectively decided to say ""fuck LeBron James"" after 16 seasons and all of a sudden stop calling fouls on him."
Lol so we gonna shit on our 6’4 PG for having a shitty game while having to guard Lebron James because our 6’9 SF simply cannot do so?
"Brush, we got Jrue Holiday out there guarding Lebron James. It's gonna be a quick 4 games."
"If there is anything we've learned from Lebron's Finals runs from 2017-2018, depth means shit if you don't have the best player on the floor.  Trust me as a Raptors fan I know this too well. Depth means absolutely nothing when Lebron averages 42 mpg in the playoffs in his career. If CJ fucking Miles is on the same court as Lebron James, you've lost, doesn't matter how good of a role player CJ was."
“When you fall your brother pick you up.” -Lebron James
LeBron James is one of a kind. Will never be another like him ever again. Enjoy it.
LeBron fucking James is really a Laker
AD fucked around and got a double double. Awesome that even on a bad shooting night you can still rely on his defense. And we also still have LeBron Fucking James.
It's Lebron James. It's gonna be a 4-0 if we play y'all.

Hi guys my name is Lebron James and I opened up a school for children that is paying the tuition for its first graduates upon entrance to the local college.
Hi guys my name is Lebron James and evening though I’m a sniveling stealing weasel the media will still depict me positively because of my background
I don’t know much about these statistics but this new list looks much better. &gt;	Here's the top ten in single-season VORP  Old:  -	2017 Russell Westbrook 12.4 -	1989 Michael Jordan 12.0 -	1988 Michael Jordan 11.8 -	2009 LeBron James 11.6 -	2010 LeBron James 10.9 -	1994 David Robinson 10.6 -	1976 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 10.5 -	2008 LeBron James 10.1 -	1990 Michael Jordan 10.1 -	2009 Chris Paul 10.0  New:  -	1988 Michael Jordan 12.5 -	2009 LeBron James 11.8 -	1989 Michael Jordan 11.4 -	1994 David Robinson 11.4 -	1991 Michael Jordan 10.8 -	1990 Michael Jordan 10.6 -	1987 Michael Jordan 10.6 -	2010 LeBron James 10.3 -	1993 Michael Jordan 10.2 -	2004 Kevin Garnett 10.0
"One factor is that LeBron had historically great performances against them, whereas James Harden had some duds mixed in. So it's easy to give LeBron a pass and shit on Harden, and they are the identities of those teams."
"The only U.S. household names in the NBA right now that I can think of are Lebron James and Stephen Curry.   I would imagine that international stars are household names in their own country, like Giannis, Luka, Porzingis, Siakam, Embiid, etc."
 LeBron James - 4 out of 5 ain't 100%. Should be 80%
Can you do our winning percentage without Lebron James?
"I get what you're saying, but I can say the same thing for DG.  &gt;he is an incredible shooter off of screens. He is really the only player we can run those type of plays for and he runs them at an elite level. He also keeps the ball moving in the half court.  Essentially what DG does except we aren't as reliant on him in the half court because we have Lebron James and Anthony Davis.  Whether Zion playing 5 and adding a 3nD guy would help, thats another conversation altogether but I get what you're saying."
Nah you got my intent wrong as well. The act of asking for privacy shouldn't be seen as being a diva. The fact that he's Lebron James means he has cameras on him 24/7. Asking for a few minutes to be off camera for certain intimate moments just seems natural. Only people who think the worst of him would jump to the conclusion that he had some other motive.
"And James Harden isn't Lebron, so lets remove him from the conversation as well.  It's about who is playing better and in what context and with those things in consideration, it's Jokic&gt;Harden this year. I'm not selectively removing anything, Nuggets have been hit hard with injuries this year and Jokic has carried them when that's happened.  And I'm not disregarding any low points, but the main difference here is Harden has Westbrook and Jokic has no one near that level. Lebron has Davis which is also far better than any secondary superstar anyone else has too, which again is why Jokic should be so much higher than he is."
"The starters never played a game together again after going up 3-1, and they were playing against LeBron James and a stacked Cavs team as well."
"And beyond the lack of star power, they essentially had no depth at all. After the 6 man rotation of LeBron, Delly, Shumpert, Thompson, Mozgov, and JR, their next best players were James Jones and Shawn Marion."
"LeBron James is 110% a top 3 player of all time, but I agree the Hakeem is one of the best ever and would feast against small ball. Nobody close to his skillset and athleticism in today's league, though."
"I can't wait for more teams to try this and fail lol. We've already seen a dozen teams try and pick up the old Morey-ball of iso's and 3's, and only teams with a Damian Lillard/Luka Doncic/LeBron James can even slightly pull it off.  It's probably the main reason I watch you guys and the Bucks so much. Y'all are two of the only teams built on a post-identity this year. Too bad you guys play the bottom of the East so often lol"
"Since Allen Iverson (not including him), 23 ROYs have been handed out.   Elton Brand, Mike Miller, MCW, Steve Francis, Brandon Roy, Andrew Wiggins, Emeka Okafor, and Tyreke Evans all do not look like they're on HOF trajectories.  Tim Duncan, Vince Carter, Pau Gasol, LeBron James, Chris Paul, and Kevin Durant are basically locks.  Kyrie Irving and Damian Lillard are well on their way.  Derrick Rose, Amar'e Stoudamire, and Blake Griffin feel like fringe guys, but stranger things have happened.  Of the last four, I like KAT (stat stuffer, team likely to improve) and Luka, am middling on my views of Simmons, and doubt heavily Malcolm Brogdon.  I think realistically, 12 of these 23 make it.   From the inception of the NBA (not BAA or ABA) through Allen Iverson, 28 of the 47 ROYs made the HOF meaning that even for the highest achieving rookies, just 60% have made the HOF.   That's pretty close to a coin flip which, to me, justifies the ""dart throw"" description."
"are you serious. no the opposite would be if there wasnt the james' proposal, that he would want to be on camera since he's a big attention seeker.   you think that people who were watching the memorial would forget about the whole thing, kobe, gigi and everything because they saw lebron for 2 seconds on the screen? dont you think that that would be too egotistical even for james"
So people that only know who Lebron James is and think Michael Jordan is still playing..
Basketball Reference tryna protect Kawhi's legacy smh LeBron Raymone James would never
I’m Lebron James
Even stevie wonder could do that -lebron James
"Saying LeBron James doesn't get enough recognition is just playing the victim card. He gets plenty of recognition from EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE in every damn season."
"I wasnt trying to make an argument, I was just showing the guy how far his head was up his ass. The substantive argument isnt even worth arguingm harden put up better numbers and won 15 more games in a MUCH more competitive conference. The end. And lol, there isnt a player who has played with more All-NBA players in the last decade then lebron james. FOH saying ""give him harden's supporting cast""...he had it last year and missed the playoffs. Case dismissed."
"In Popovich's words when asked about Lebron passing instead of shooting:  [He knows more than all of you put together. He understands the game. If he makes a pass and you all think he should have shot it, or he shoots it and you think he should have made a pass, your opinions mean nothing to him, as they should not mean anything to him.](https://sports.yahoo.com/gregg-popovich-defends-lebron-james-around-game-because-164058492.html?y20=1&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIJG_UXLHvrvHklPsp4mxk6Uk4if392qHfOvc78JV1bsFg6oVsfIrwSmjkCmIU4gPwwMR13zv8mTTgtMq2CFSeviitszSntEUcmR-vLe2zuidwd8vr0S2E05GjqIvc4cUJCsLwyY5TaU-PmAn3VnsCAWyo2WSwoDWh_zL_d6SP4X)"
"Agree, this is a fun thing to debate  I would point you to statistics. In 2019 Messi had a great season, knocking in 14% of his free kicks. Whereas here is an article showing how 2 years ago LeBron was above 50% on deep 3s. And LeBron isn't even a legendary shooter like Steph or Dame. This shows how much more difficult free kicks are. Both those numbers are outliers, and it's usually more like 8% vs 35%, but still in favor of the deep 3s  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-james-is-the-new-steph-curry/"
"LeBron is the best player I've ever seen, and he's still amazing, but he's clearly not the same as he was at his highest peak.  He's a little slower, so we hide him from the best wings on defense, he went from being the greatest ever at finishing at the rim to being merely elite, and his foul shooting is a legitimate problem.  His 3 point shooting might make up for those ""deficiencies"", if it's reliable, but I still feel like he's pretty streaky (that shot from the logo last night though... man that was sexy, haha).  Giannis is just having an all around better year on an all around better team (we'll see what happens in the playoffs), and he shouldn't be shamed for recognizing what pretty much else does as well (James Harden excepted, of course)."
I’m sure this isn’t about Lebron James
"Yeah, that is a good comparison. Kinda feels as if Luka needs them more than Lebron, because he is not as strong and fast as James. Luka gets only by the defenders, when they stay close and get beaten by Luka's 1st step."
"Trae is a better shooter than Luka and about the same level of a better ball handler (for what that's even worth), otherwise Luka is better than Trae in pretty much all of those categories.  Luka is one of the best finishers in the league, he's shooting 75% (74.9%) withing 3 feet of the basket. For reference, LeBron James in the 2009-10 season shot 74.5% at the same distance. Meanwhile Trae Young is barely scratching above 60% at the rim (60.2%). Saying that Trae is even arguably as good is completely disrespectful to the leaps and bounds Luka's made since last year to become an all-league finisher.  And as far as scoring goes, Luka has way more stuff in his arsenal than Trae does due to his superior size and athleticism. Luka, despite being a low percentage 3 point shooter, isn't a bad shooter per se, he is certainly capable of heating up and hitting handfuls of 3s. His stepback is deadly and he's able to create space with his handle. His ability to decelerate almost immediately and his incredible balance on drives allows him to create a ton of space, making it nearly impossible to stay with him when he's going downhill even if he doesn't have a 40+ inch vert or a crazy good 3/4 sprint. Trae just can't create the kind of space that Luka can on his own, and relies a lot on screens in order to get his seperation, which isn't a bad thing, but Luka is just able to create the space needed to get his jumper or floater off against better defenders on his own.  As far as passing goes, Luka and Trae are both amoung the best in the league. They both have been blessed with court vision that few other players have. Honestly I would say that were they the same size they would both be the same caliber of passers, but Trae's height limits him and makes certain passes harder as well as it makes it harder for Trae to literally see the court. Trae Young currently leads the league in turnovers, and that's a product of him getting trapped in situations due to his height where a guy like Luka wouldn't be. They're both the same level of passers, but Luka's got the physical tools that alllow him to be better.  Luka Doncic, as amazing as his rookie season was, is having an even more impressive one now. It's not a wonder that the Dallas Mavericks are setting the record for the most efficient offense in the league this year, Luka Doncic is legitimately that amazing, and the notion that Trae is somehow a superior player because he hits more 3s is a symptom of what's wrong with the way we, as fans, think about the sport."
Anytime I see Lebron James now I picture that vine with that kid saying it
Lebron James is 100% the Lakers best player what kind of bullshit did you just type wtf. Lebron is probably still the best player in the entire league.
"Majority doesn’t mean it’s right. I don’t see how regular season basketball outweighs excellent playoff performances which results in winning a championships. Of course there will be outliers to the FMVP performances like Kawhi’s first one and I think the fact that it was for his defence on Lebron James alone and not for his greatness as a player at the time. Because of that, I’ll discredit that first one when making a comparison to Steph Curry. In general though, I think a proper best player FMVP is worth much more."
Well playing more minutes could be because they were better?  Also you ignore the vast change in pace over the past 15 years or so.

"Stephen ""LeBron James"" Curry"
Oh god please. My child hood was robbed. And as much as watching greatest happen like Lebron James is fun. It would be such sweet justice for the REAL upset of an 8 seed beating a 1 seed in 7 Games. LAKERS KINGS. Bring back the early 2000's rivalry. What dream. Go Kings!
"&gt;A guy who's played for 14 years and has a championship doesn't need to play games in March and April.  Unless that guy is Michael Jordan or LeBron James, yes he certainly does.  And yes, IF Dion is able to buy into the system and provide a decent jolt in scoring off the bench, then he will eventually eat away at Rondo's minutes.  If he surpasses expectations, he may be in the 8-9 man rotation come playoff time."
"Really? We're gonna pretend that Giannis is the frontrunner because of the Bucks' record? Not because averaging 30/14/6 while being a top-3 defensive player over an entire season is one of the most dominant stretches any player has ever had in the history of the sport?  If Giannis played in New York, we'd be debating whether Peak Giannis is better than Peak Shaq was.  **EDIT:** [Full-season stat comparison from Basketball Reference.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_select=LeBron+James&amp;y1=2020&amp;player_id1=jamesle01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;player_id2_select=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;y2=2020&amp;player_id2=antetgi01&amp;idx=players) C'mon, people."

"Definitely a shuffle.  As the dribble ended he took more than 2 steps.    The main reason it got over looked, is the spontaneity of the super long shot and well it's LeBron James.  My team as well as many others have been victims of that mythical 'LeBron shuffle'.   That being said, agree to disagree."

I like stat updates on rookies but always laugh when they say shit like the ONLY OTHER people to do this on a Tuesday night in January as a teenager? Lebron James and Michael Jordan
Lmao Kyrie was playing with prime Lebron James and Curry had Draymond/Klay.  Unless you can start naming some realistic players to make this work I would stop thinking about building a defensive minded team around Dlo and Towns
"""Lebron James is continuing to put up statlines near his career averages"""
It is called the Super LeFuckYou 3 and it exist because LeBron James does not care about your family.
"Right! My first thought when I saw this on ESPN this AM. I’m like, “Dame does this on the regular, but when LeBron does it ESPN does a 5 minute segment.” Nothing against King James as he’s a heck of a player, but give credit where credit is due."
"LeBron James, Chris Paul, Prime Rondo"
"What's wrong with that statement? Do you want Dwight Howard guarding the perimeter? No, that is not ideal since most of his defensive value comes from rim protection.   On offense, do you want Dwight Howard and his defender clogging the paint for LeBron James against a team that's absurdly good at protecting the rim? That doesn't sound like a great idea, especially since Milwaukee's defensive scheme allows a ton of threes. LeBron is at his best when he has space to operate.   If you think optimizing spacing isn't the better option with LeBron James running the offense against an all-time great interior defensive team, I don't know what to say to you lmao."
"More like, when you are LeBron James you do what you want. Score/home/away don't matter"
"https://www.nyaabasketball.org/page/show/1318992-boy-s-class-of-2023  The Naismith national youth all American report has bronny James ranked as the #1 recruit in the class of 2023, this is ahead of some other standout freshman such as Mikey Williams. This article was a from last summer so things could’ve have changed some in that time, but probably not enough to change the fact that he is among some of the top recruits and is a 5 star.  It is quite difficult to find recruiting rankings for players who are freshmen in high school, but I have also heard people talk about him as a 5 star recruit.   I’d like you to show me Where you see that he is not a top recruit in the nation. I haven’t seen anything that says likewise but maybe there’s certain sites that do not see him as good of a recruit.  I’m genuinely curious where you are seeing he’s not a top recruit so if you could show me that would be great.  Edit: https://www.coast2coastpreps.com/news_article/show/949307  Here is another article from September 2018 that has lebron ranked 24th in the nation which still make him one of the top recruits. He has probably gotten better since then."

More to do with that a player is more commoditized in hockey - Sidney Crosby doesn’t have as much impact in terms of %edge as someone like Lebron James  Or u can think about it in terms of VORP - elite basketball players contribute much more than an average “replacement” in driving win shares over their hockey counterparts  What it means is that for branding and for “speaking out” like you’re alluding to it’s a lot riskier for a hockey player...the sport is ~30 members/team with set offense/defensive roles..over basketball when teams like the rockets are playing 8-9 men deep
"You know, except in the first game where you could clearly hear ""defense"" chants when Lebron James was bringing up the ball."
Apparently as many as you want if your name is LeBron James.
This is an apt comparison.   Barcelona total goals for in the 2018-2019 Season: 90 Messi goals for Barcelona 2018-2019 Season:36  Messi scores 40% of Barcelona’s goals.  LeBron James 2018-2019 points: 1505 LA lakers 2018-2019 total points: 9165 LeBron scores 16.4% of all LA laker points.  After considering that about 60% of a soccer team is in positions that literally have no intention of actually scoring goals. This is quite comparable dominance. Messi is still higher though.
"Kobe, Magic, Kareem, Shaq, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Gail Goodrich, James Worthy, George Mikan, Jamal Wilkes, and Alex Caruso.    That’s 11 off the top of my head that I would put over LeBron on the Lakers hierarchy, and I didn’t even include Wilt.  Really I see LeBron’s laker career as very similar to Wilt’s.  Neither one will be with the Lakers long enough to really be considered an all-time Laker even though they’re both obviously all time great NBA players."
"The Lakers can absolutely beat us. But I think it’s absolutely gonna be a battle. Maybe one of the best postseason series ever. We are better 1-8 buuuut LeBron James. LeBron James, LeBron James."

"And there's the 15yo coming out from behind his veil. Lesson, don't throw childish insults around when trying to argue with adults, it just shows your age and you're only embarrassing yourself. Anyway, who said anything about KD being MVP because LeBron was being nice? Seriously, where did you get that from because I said nothing of the sort, it's almost like you're completely making stuff up to support your weak argument. Also embarrassing. And besides, LeBron is *far* from nice, he will [openly say](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/lebron-james-mvp-2018-3?r=US&amp;IR=T) that he deserves the MVP if he thinks he does, there is no way in hell he'll say someone else deserves it just to be nice.

Pretty crazy. Free throws are like the only thing that anybody can be good at and some of the best players are mediocre. I shoot around 85% in my mens league from the line and yet most NBA players aren't even close to that. I'm sure lebron James has taken 100x more practice free throws than I have yet shoots 20% less from the line.

"Stacking up picks doesn't build dynasties.

I'm frankly tired of all these teams stockpiling picks and doing dick with them. What it tells me is there's some paralysis by analysis, indecision, and a lack of ability. If you can't find a franchise piece with a good draft pick, so you trade it for 2 good draft picks for next year, you aren't getting twice the chances. Because you already fucking showed you'd rather keep your job for another year, than actually bet on yourself and your abilities. (I'm not saying there aren't sometimes reasons to move a pick now for more later, but it's more than that).  Got a bunch of mediocre front offices who sit around churning picks for 5 years waiting for the perfect moment that never arrives, kicking the can down the road and never making a serious push to contend. Almost like their plan is to keep their job as long as they can and hope they luck into a Lebron James. You'd be better off picking some random fuckboy from the team subreddit and giving him a 1 year contract to be GM. He might fuck it up, but at least he'll shoot his fucking shot."
~~Lebron James~~ Glenn Robinson IV
"""Ohhh blocked by James! Lebron James with the rejection."""
Lebron James. You act like the East wasnt always Lebrons team making it. Only reason East is interesting is Lebron left. People acting like Playoff Lebron with arguably his best teammate hes ever had cant beat Kawhi who has a bum knee and is overrated because he beat a injury riddled Warriors
You’re wrong  2016 - Warriors choke and don’t win the title.   Adds KD  2017 - Goes 16-1 dominates the league and KD has the greatest finals performance in NBA history   2018 - KD leads the warriors and sweeps the LeBron James Cavaliers    2x finals MVP speaks for itself.

I mean Lebron is a pretty unique name.   People still call him King James
That’s true — this is how he and Bron were introduced originally (LeBron wanted one of his throwback Warren Moon jerseys).   https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-rich-paul-2014-8

&gt; Was Lebron James' popularity natural or manufactured?  lmao  Dawg he has the 3rd most points ever in NBA History and made the Finals 8 straight seasons.   I think he brought his own popularity and the reason the media covers him so much is because people care.
lebron james is king nothing
"okay, but it literally started with the cover of SLAM.   Was Lebron James' popularity natural or manufactured?"
"Because it’s Lebron James, the most popular star since Jordan"
I mean if you look at their systems they play in it’s not that hard. Russ’s team has the ball in his hands 90% of the time he’s there without James with 5 shooters so he just drives past and has no one at the rim to contest it. Lebron plays with 2 big men on the court clogging the paint 80% of the game
"He's not a generational talent. MJ, Shaq, Kobe and LeBron maybe even KD and Steph are generational talent. James Harden while good is not on the same tier as those I mentioned."
From first to last:  * LeBron * Chris Paul * Westbrook * Kevin Durant * Steph Curry * James Harden * Blake Griffin * Damian Lillard * Kawhi Leonard * Giannis Antentokempo
"If you'll allow me to take some liberties with your question, Lebron James' play gets overshadowed by Ray Allen's shot in Game 6. 32/10/11/3/1"
"Shaq would slaughter majority of his opposition in any era, especially this one. I remember someone asking in a forum a year ago if Hakeem Olajuwon could play today. I almost fell out of my seat.  As far as tape on the era, I think a lot of old timers forget that we simply didn't watch ball everyday like we can today. It just wasn't on TV. The NBA and ABA weren't nearly as big. Heck, even in the ""golden era"" of the 80s, it wasn't on as much. We didn't see past players like we see constant highlights of current superstars and teams. So I completely understand not being able to fairly analyze guys like Wilt. To younger fans, Wilt is more of an idea, stories, and statistics. A myth if anything.  I'll tell you this though - Wilt's competition at the center position over his career was better than Shaq's. The closest thing you can compare it to if Shaq's earlier years against the Olajuwons, Robinsons, Ewings. Peak Shaq didn't play those guys though.  Point taken though. Shaq is an approximation of Chamberlain so I understand. You touched on another reason why I was never a big Shaq guy. Too lazy. He didn't max out. Not close. I don't want a guy who doesn't take it seriously all of the time leading my team. For all the criticisms of LeBron, I can never accuse him of not taking care of his body.  The Kobe vs MJ thing is something I've always loved to dive into. My viewpoint are:  1. Kobe was more skilled, Jordan was more athletic. Both were very hard workers, but Kobe worked a little harder. He had too. If Jordan had Kobe's athleticism, he'd either have worked harder or been a worse player than Kobe. In that sense, it becomes basic logic. Because Jordan was born with more gifts and because he worked equally as hard or maybe a little less, Kobe was never going to be better. Jordan was a better defender primarily because he was more athletic. Kobe couldn't work Jordan's gifts into his repertoire.  2. Jordan simply has more career accolades. It's not close. Some by circumstance. If Kobe were born in 1963, he'd probably have accomplished most, if not all of what Jordan did. However, that could never be proved. All we can go off of is what happened. We get into psychology, effects of time travel, etc.. if we dive too much into switching places (Jordan influenced Kobe so would he be the same if he were born earlier? Kobe was raised in Italy by his dad who played in the 70s. Does his upbringing change? How would Jordan's gambling habits be viewed today in this media? If Phil coached Kobe first, how would he treat Jordan differently? It goes on forever).  3. Kobe's 2004 case plays a huge role in how the basketball community views him. He is not adored the way other players are. There are people who HATE Kobe the person. Not the player. The person. Other players get hate, but it's mostly their game or something stupid they did. I hate James Harden the player. I don't have an opinion on him as a human being. Few players receive the level of vitriol and disdain Kobe does. Add on to that is Michael Jordan is a hero to a lot of people. Kobe sometimes flew too close to the sun of being better than him. People don't like that.  With all of that said, Jordan will forever be viewed as the better player and rightfully so. Overall, Kobe is massively unappreciated. I think his death kind of made people accept how amazing he was, but it feels too little too late to me. I've seen players for decades and Kobe has been one that has stood out to me. I used to be big fans of other players like Jerry West, John Havlicek, and Allen Iverson. They are still on my list, but not on my Mount Rushmore."
"A user on the Celtics sub (u/blackadar1) said it well with a post about how the Celtics ended up with Tatum (can’t directly post to the OP as auto mod is removing it);  &gt; Ainge's Brass Balls (Tatum)  I don't think many people realize how rare and risky Ainge's trade was with Philly. It's the type of deal that ends a GM's career. So I thought it deserved a bit of historical significance. This might be a little long, so please bear with me.  There have been 35 NBA lotteries. Of those 35 lotteries, 30 of the teams drafting 1st made and kept the pick. That's 86% of the time. Why is this? Because GMs know that it's the least risky move for a couple of reasons. Top picks boil down to 1 of three types:  1. There's an obvious choice for the #1 pick that's a sure-fire basketball God (Lebron, Tim Duncan). Call this the no-brainer choice but this doesn't happen all that often. 2. There's a clear #1 who should be very good. This is most of the picks. 3. There's occasionally not a #1 and teams have a choice between 2 or 3 guys (think 2005, with Bogut going #1 but the 2 Williams and Chris Paul could have also gone in that slot).  So why don't GMs make trades in the cases of #2 and #3? Because sticking to the pick and taking a guy #1 is the least risky move for their careers. If a player flops, most of that heat will fall back on the player. Even when it's an epic fail - like Kwame Brown in 2001 - the player still gets most of the brunt of the wrath from the fans. The GM can throw up their hands and say ""he was the consensus guy, it's not my fault"" and many fans will accept that (to a lesser or greater degree).  So only in 5 cases - less than 14% of the time - has that #1 pick been moved.  1. 1986 - Philly had the pick via trade with the Clips and moved it to Cleveland for Roy Hinson. Pat Williams was the GM who made that trade under demand from the owner before going to Orlando. 2. 1993 - Orlando traded the #1 pick (C-Web) for #3 (Penny Hardaway) and 3 1st round picks. They did this largely because it was assumed that Orlando's Shaquille O'Neal couldn't play with Chris Webber. 3. 2011 - the Clippers had another Clipper moment and moved an unprotected lottery pick to Cleveland, which became Kyrie. Note that this wasn't the top pick but ended up being the #1 choice, so it could be discounted from this list entirely. 4. 2014 - Cleveland traded Wiggins for K-Love to build a Championship team around LeBron. 5. 2017 - Then there's the Boston-Philly deal.  So in two of those cases, the trade was understandable due to team makeup or goals (1993 and 2014).  The 1986 and 2011 deals are still stains on the GMs and teams that made them. Williams is still reviled in Philly (though it was the owner who demanded the deal) and Oshley managed to escape because the Clippers are known as the idiot black hole in the NBA universe.  That leads us to 2017. Never, in the entire NBA lottery history, had a GM traded down in the lottery except in 1993 trade where the circumstances of why the trade was made were exceptionally clear. So never had a GM traded out of a consensus #1 pick to move down because they disagreed with that consensus. That's a career-ending move if you get it wrong.  Markelle Fultz was a consensus #1. Called a low-risk, high reward player, Fultz was often compared to James Harden with better defense. That was the narrative and there are plenty of links on the web to find that information...Hardwood Houdini, Bleacher Report, [NBADraft.Net](https://NBADraft.Net), etc.  Tatum was often compared to Harrison Barnes, Jabari Parker and Rudy Gay. Not great. In many publications in the run up to the draft he wasn't even in the top 4 or 5 guys. Fultz, Ball and Josh Jackson were the consensus top 3. Tatum was in the next group with 3 or 4 other guys.   You simply don't - can't - make a deal to move off Fultz in that case. Any other GM would simply have stayed put, drafted Fultz (we were going to need a replacement for IT anyway if Rozier wasn't the guy) and if he didn't pan out then it's not the GMs fault.  Instead, Ainge and his GIANT BRASS BALLS made a trade that I don't think any other GM would make. He moved down to take the lesser-considered player. Two years later, of all the guys in the top 10 of that draft only 1 (Lauri Markkanen) has even half the win shares that Tatum does. He also has the best VORP. Guys like Lauri and Fox are playing well but Tatum is clearly the head of that top 10 group.  It's time to give Danny the credit due to him for this deal. He made a deal that is very rarely done and for reasons that no one else has had the guts to make from that top slot. Trader Danny has made some really amazing deals in his career but this one may go down as his finest hour."
Honestly never been more proud that our beloved playoff choker put up 47 points in a losing effort while literally being the only player in the team that could shoot.   And yet he came out of the series with less credit than he deserved. That’s a guy getting Lebron James treatment from the media and fans while he’s obviously not Lebron James or as good as him. Everyone is a playoff choker these days if it fits a narrative.
"I didn't leave that out though, that's part of narrative and not really factual. More or less help is pretty subjective..  Rose had a much better supporting cast overall in my opinion. That Heat Team was badly composed outside of the Big 3 compared to the Celtics or the Bulls. Boozer averaged 18/10, Joakim Noah proceeds to win a DPOY later in his career and finished 4th in MVP voting himself 2 years later. Luol Deng was good 2 way player and averaged 17ppg that season. They had solid roleplayers with Korver, a young Taj Gibson, Ronnie Brewer who was a really solid defender and an old-ass Kurt Thomas who could still anchor a defense.   Saying Rose didn't have any help is like saying Harden didn't have any help once CP3 was out due to injuries, when in reality both Rose Harden and even Giannis have supporting casts that helped (or help) them excel at the things they're good at. Rose didn't have help is a 2011 take when all we did was looking at basic boxscore stats - ppg, reb, ast and fg%... it's not that accurate and a narrative driven take since Rose was their auto-offense that the team desperately needed. The roster composition wasn't as optimal as today's teams but none of the late 00s teams were that optimized - the first teams to really value good spacing at all times were the smallball Heat the years after and the 2014 Spurs.  IF Rose had to do such a tremendous carry job he'd lead a bunch of the stats I pointed out over LeBron since that is how impact metrics work - they do a solid job measuring individual performance on a team. BPM also recognizes the great impact of Harden or Giannis accurately for example. Rose was one of the better offensive stars that year but he never was in the same tier as the players I mentioned earlier. The Chicago Bulls in 10/11 were second in defensive rating and second in points allowed - they had a super strong defense which won them games. I agree that Rose carried them offensively but not to the degree where he exceeds LBjs individual play. They only had 4 Ws more once the season was over, that's not a huge difference either.  Orlando finished that season 4th in the eastern conference which is historically too low of a seed to earn serious MVP consideration - the first player who actually got out of this mantra was Westbrook a couple of years ago, who really didn't have any help and it showed in basic boxscores, in impact metrics and while simply watching games. Similarly Dwight deserved consideration but his season wasn't quite outstanding enough.  The reason why LBJ didn't get the MVP was narrative. He won 2 MVPs before and people expected the Heat to be the new 2000 Lakers or 96 Bulls and they were disappointed that they weren't at that level. LeBron James was still clearly the best player in the league and led his team to the second seed in his conference anyways. Giving him the 10/11 MVP would have meant a 3peat in MVPs for LBJ which people felt he didn't ""deserve"" ultimately. He was hated during that time and in doubt people would rather go against him. LBJ wasn't coasting that year either. From a Basketball perspective there really isn't a lot pointing to LBJ not deserving it. Rose won it because he led a good team and was spectacular and electrifying to watch, he always gave 100% and was an emotional player which appeals to everybody. Still inferior to almost everything LBJ could do."
"Take this down. My name is LeBron Raymone James Sr. and Jayson Tatum is the (expletive) truth. Quote me on that and don't take nothing out. I knew he could play, but I didn't know he could play like this. Jayson Tatum is The Truth."
"All NBA defense forward spots: Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo, PJ Tucker, LeBron James. Jonathan Isaac will have missed too much time. Can only pick 4. Have fun deciding."
When he was in the finals at 23 - his athleticism jumped off the screen playing against 27 year old lebron James.

\&gt;He didn't coast in 2018.  He couldn't because Cavs were dysfunctional (what else is new)   &amp;#x200B;  That's not entirely true. The reason he coasted around the late December to January period was because they were dysfunctional.  He was having one of the best offensive years of his career and was neck and neck with Harden in the MVP race that year. I personally would have argued that he was better up until that point.  At least up until the Christmas game against the Warriors. It's worth noting that Harden was injured at some point during that stretch and if there was any chance for LeBron to solidify his case for MVP it was then. The Cavs went into a landslide losing 13 of their next 19 games with James posting the worst plus minus of  his entire career in the month of January (-99) and playing some absolutely lazy defense. If you were watching that year then it was pretty clear that he was staging a protest against the FO. He started turning it back on during the Wolves vs Cavs overtime game where he hit the game winner over Butler. This was the game before half the entire roster was traded and then he resumed his high level of play.
"Guards are deeper, but F/C is still stacked in the West:   * Kawhi Leonard * LeBron James * Paul George * Nikola Jokic * Anthony Davis * Karl Anthony Towns * Kristaps Porziņģis * Zion Williamson * LaMarcus Aldridge * Rudy Gobert  This isn't even including not quite all star but really skilled guys like: DeAndre Ayton, Draymond Green, Danilo Gallinari, Steven Adams, Jaren Jackson Jr, DeMarcus Cousins."
How the Lakers missed the playoffs with a prime Lebron James is insane
"Ah yes the package that never existed that that would’ve had us trade Kawhi Leonard+Danny to pair up with Lebron James, in return for Loul deng for salary filler Lonzo ball and josh hart and late first picks due to the fact they made Kuzma and Ingram untouchable. Spectacular"
You're a kings fan you would never do something like watch LeBron James play basketball it's beneath you.
"Well there was a rule to counter drawing a foul on a three I thought was dubbed the ""James Harden"" rule, didn't watch much of Wade in the East and definitely didn't watch the Heat when LeBron went there"

tim duncan is better than lebron james
This is 23 year old LeBron James btw lol
James Harden and Lebron James would make James James  Davis Bertans and Anthony Davis would make Davis Davis
Wade had 200 steals and 100 blocks that season. I think he was only the second guard since Jordan to do that. Box score wise he actually had better numbers than LeBron who won MVP. Although Bron won way more games and his advanced stats were god like.

"As great as that name is, Lebronto had so much to it. Everyone thought the Raptors were going to give him a hard time.

He talks down on guys like Giannis and Zion who utilize their athleticism instead of their skills and has even said Giannis wasn't an MVP candidate and was as skilled as an average 12 year-old. He calls players soft and ""pussies"" for talking about their physical and metal problems and will just retreat to how tough the 90's era was.  But the dude claims to not hate LeBron yet calls him lame nicknames such as LeBrick and LeBum, said he's the product of corporate America, and has even called him a Satanist because of his pre-game handshakes and hand signs.   This guy is also a pussy who blocks people on Twitter if they disagree with him and looks like Elmer Fudd if they did a Looney Tunes live action film."
"Anybody know who Bruce Blitz is?  If you don't, not a loss. Dude is a fucking moron. But if you do, I pity you. For those who don't know, he's pretty much your standard NBA fan above the age of 35. He does nothing but romanticize 90's basketball, worships Michael Jordan, and oh yeah, repeatedly trashes the modern NBA. But overall he just has a huge disdain, even hatred, for LeBron James.

"Sure, if just want to ignore basketball:    &gt; “Last year, we really couldn’t get to it as much as we wanted to on fast breaks. But lately, he’s been jumping to the moon. People call me the worst best lob thrower on the team, but I purposely do it because I want to see what he can do. And I believe he looks at it like that too, because he looks at it as a challenge.”  https://cavsnation.com/j-r-smith-throws-bad-lob-passes-to-lebron-james-on-purpose/"
"You’re missing the point, the person I’m responding to is saying China is the best at league of legends despite its two winning teams comprising partially of players from South Korea.  To put it another way, if China opened its checkbooks and paid, say, LeBron James, Harden, Giannis, etc, to come play for their national teams (a situation like that has happened, although in women’s basketball), that would certainly be the best team, but the US would still be the best at basketball by virtue of it producing the best players.  Hope that made sense."
"This is an obvious bait to get people to shit on LeBron.  This place is starting to get a hate boner for Bron.  There will be threads full of comments shitting on him and the top comment will still be “LeBron gets his dick sucked by this sub, any criticism of him is downvoted “.  I don’t mind disliking LeBron James because I can easily see why, but I do mind people still saying this sub sucks him off when it’s the opposite circlejerk now."
"He happened to graduate from the same high school as Lebron James and latched onto him early. Rode those coattails all the way to a career at ESPN.   I’ve never enjoyed anything he’s written, I don’t think he’s particularly good at his job. He got extremely lucky, but credit to him for putting in the work and making himself available for the opportunity."
"&gt; It was like being in a car accident. LeBron James ran over 18,000 people."
The gm who didn't draft Kyrie and who was there when Lebron James decided to save your franchise? He got lucky to land Wiggins and that KLove wanted out of Minny. Dude shows up and gets gifted number one picks. You are massively overrating him.
I am going to go out on a limb and say that I believe that LeBron James is a human person.
"Steph Curry, James Harden, Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis"
"I'm sure you believe everything he says, like this:   &gt; “LeBron James was talking about how he’s the best ever, but he never saw Wilt play,” Abdul-Jabbar said. “If he had, he wouldn’t say that. Whenever he averages 55 points a game, then I might want to listen to what he has to say. I’m not trying to put LeBron down. He’s awesome. He’s the best player in this era at this point. But he didn’t see Bill Russell play. When his team wins eight consecutive NBA championships, maybe I’ll compare him to Bill Russell.”"
"I struggled to believe he is real as well, so I named my cat Lebron James. Now I can talk to him directly every day."
"Skip: Michael Jordan played with the gambler's flu but LeBron James won't even play in games because of some new kid on the block virus? This is why I'll always continue to speak of LeBron with his true name, his real name unlike his fake reputation, as the faux GOAT.   Shannon Sharpe, wearing a GOAT costume with a medical face mask over it: SKEEEEEUP!    ....honestly I'd probably still watch it."

What does LeBron James mean to you?
Is LeBron James a concept or a way of life
 [WOJ] Inside Sources confirm Dywane Wade is coming out of Retirement to join forces with LeBron James in Miami. Chris Bosh not invited
bro have you read about his career-long hatred of Lebron James lol
Jason Kidd early 2000's (still athletic but a decent jump shot) Klay Thompson mid 2010's Kawhi Leonard mid 2010's (before she became an elite on ball scorers) LeBron James (2013) Kevin Garnett mid 2000's  With a big boy center to move in and slide LeBron and KG down a position when needed.
ESPN: is lebron james saying that dwayne wade was a better teammate than anthony davis?
"Time will be kinder on his legacy. Hell look at this year people have already started to mentally learned to separate the OG Warriors from KD and are starting to realize the OG Warriors weren’t responsible for the unfairness of the KD Warriors and their accomplishments still count because they were here before KD. The whole 5 year run blurs together that’s why the word “dynasty” and the sentence “3 championships in 5 years” have started to become more prevalent.   Steph was here for all of it. People will know that. History books will adore Lebron James, and they will also be kind on his greatest adversary: Stephen Curry."
Lmaoo come on they have enough material. Tom Brady FA. Dak money. Astros cheating. Lebron James next destination. Will Brony James go #1. Is zion the next Lebron? Is Lebron load managing. Kawhi vs Lebron. Is kyrie stupid. Will KD and kyrie work together. Does Donovan Mitchell hate Rudy Gobert. Is the rockets Hardens team or Westbrook team. Will small ball work. Why small ball won’t work. Why small ball will work and Rockets are the next dynasty. Antonio brown. Colin kapernick. MJ VS Lebron. China. Spike Lee. Dolan. NCAA. Etc.
"Gotta be weird being LeBron James. On the one hand you know you gotta stay humble. On the other, you watch your own highlights, with decades of experience telling you exactly how you stack up, and you gotta think ""god damn I did some next level shit"""
"While this question is interesting it kind’ve depends on a lot. But fuck it let’s give it a shot.  Let’s take it as building a full roster. Given that no salary cap is involved, I’ll take the dream team and replace a few players, that would look like this.  Guards: Magic Johnson Michael Jordan John Stockton Steph Curry (replacing Clyde drexler)  Forwards: Larry Bird (assuming this is prime and not Larry sprawled on the floor for his back in practice) Charles Barkley Karl Malone  Lebron James (replacing Chris mullin) Kevin Durant (replacing Christian laettner)  Centers: David Robinson Shaquille O’Neal (replacing Patrick Ewing) Hakeem Olajuwon (replacing Scottie pippen)  So, how does that team lose? Barring incredible injuries to like every player I don’t see how it happens assuming they are all actively trying to win every game but I think that’s the problem. If this team just replaced an nba team’s roster next season, one that doesn’t matter (the knicks), they would win every game they tried but let’s say they are like fucking 69-0 they are playing some shit team on a back to back and they just don’t care, maybe they lose.  I’m conclusion probably not and I’m very bored."
"Day 4,365 of no NBA: Lebron James college highlights"
"82-0 would require all-time greats, but also consistent, low enough ego superstars to maximize their potential on their new superteam.  Steve Nash - A guy who had an impressive track record of regular season success with much less talent than I'm about to give him.  Tough and selfless.  Doesn't need to score on any given night.  John Stockton would be a good choice too.  Ray Allen - Great defender, world class shooter.  Argueably goat catch and shoot player.  Incredibly reliable scorer and underrated overall game.  Kawhi Leonard - I just love his defense.  Great all around scorer and a player who seems to look for the team's best shot.  Never finds himself freewheeling too much.  Pippen would also be a good choice here.  Lebron James - Do I have to write something to justify this pick?  No, but I think he might be the best player at getting the most out of his teammates ever.  Simple.  Tim Duncan - Awesome defender.  lethal bank shot ensures the paint will never be clogged.  Excellent passer (especially out of post ups)."
I separated the rosters in tiers because imo it'll be impossible to class them. But yeah any roster with two top 5 players (one being LeBron fucking James) should be in tier 1
If I had to choose a player to make a play for these players to take a shot to save my life... I'd take LeBron James.
"That's weird, this post has nothing to do with LeBron James?"
"Yes he can lie, there is multiple instances where he just likes drama and has been wrong, that doesn't make him unreliable, it just means he can  be wrong too   He was wrong about LeBron too, and he got so angry that he got no info from LeBrons camp that he keeps putting up posts against him all the time, he really doesn't like LeBron because he never got info from his camp  &gt;1 week before 'The Decision' Woj wrote ""the Chicago Bulls are still the team to beat, with Cleveland a close second and New Jersey the looming wild card""  Before LeBron signed for Miami   &gt;As The New Republic put it:  &gt;His reporting on LeBron James was consistently sloppy and poorly sourced, yet Wojnarowski had the audacity to present his piece as the definitive account. With just two quotes from anonymous sources and a history of being wrong about James, it doesn’t deserve to be treated as reliable.  &gt;As Ethan Strauss put it:  &gt;“If all this was so telegraphed, then Wojnarowski missed multiple Morse [code] memos. Now Adrian claims retroactive omniscience? My temples throb at the thought. Insiders should prove their status with a hefty helping of named sources. I give leeway to those with impeccable track records, but Adrian just whiffed on a big one."
LeBron James in Space Jam 2
You guys overrate the fuck out of Kevin durant. Great player but not a conference swinger  It’s much closer to if James Harden/Curry were coming off an injury than if you introduced a prime LeBron.    KD has never proved he can be the the focal point and the man who eats up the bulk of the defensive attention and win a title. Now he is almost 32 coming off the worst injury in sports   Temper expectations
"Kyrie's supporting cast supported Kyrie, that's usually what happens. A single player doesn't really carry a team themselves (Well a lot of them do...just not to great success) outside of a few rare instances (Lebron James and the pre-Heat Cavs for an example). That's why you have instances [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn5L21fXtnQ). Will this change with KD? Probably, but the current Nets supporting cast  is not as good as the 2018 Celtics.  &gt;you realise you guys lost to the Nets without Kyrie and KD this season  And how many did we win? Lmao. The Lakers just lost to that Nets, guess that means Kyrie and KD Nets are gonna easily destroy them too."
This is the most depressed I have felt in a long time. I really hope the season isnt cancelled completely.   The Bucks were having the best season in my lifetime only for this to happen. I really wanted to see  Giannis and Lebron James in the finals :(
"I mean if I was Lebron James, I would watch highlights of myself too"
"""Would Lebron James still be the best player in the league if he played with the Coronavirus?"""
"&gt;You can’t imagine what this was like to witness in person. I know Michael Jordan had similarly astonishing games, and others, too, but not with stakes like that. This wasn’t just an elimination game. This was LeBron James’s entire career being put on trial … and it only took an hour for him to tell the jury, “Go home. I’m one of the best players ever. Stop picking me apart. Stop talking about the things I can’t do. Stop holding me to standards that have never been applied to any other NBA player. Stop blaming me for an admittedly dumb decision I never should have made. Stop saying I’m weak. Stop saying that I don’t want to win. Stop. Just … stop.”  &gt;As a Celtics fan, I was devastated. As a basketball fan, I appreciated the performance for what it was. One of the greatest players ever was playing one of his greatest games ever. He swallowed up every other relevant story line. Needless to say, the Celtics couldn’t match him — especially Pierce, who’s worn down from four weeks of battling Andre Iguodala, Shane Battier and LeBron on one leg and appears to be running on fumes of his fumes’ fumes at this point. The fans were so shell-shocked that many (including me and my father) filed out with three minutes remaining, not because we were lousy fans, not to beat the traffic, but because we didn’t want to be there anymore. We wanted to get away from LeBron. He ruined what should have been a magical night. We never really had a chance to cheer, swing the game, rally our guys, anything. He pointed a remote control at us and pressed “MUTE.” It was like being in a car accident. LeBron James ran over 18,000 people."
Tennessee legend LeBron James
LeBron James
"He did clarify, his initial clash with Morey wasn't primarily over the fact that Morey even spoke up but that Morey chose to speak up while there were still NBA players in China. His exact quote was ""I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it."" Again, he wasn't disagreeing with the tweet itself but more how Morey handled it.  As for the situation as a whole in China, this was Lebron's exact quote: ""I felt like with this particular situation, it was something that not only was I not informed enough about, I just felt like it was something that not only myself and my teammates or our organization had enough information to even talk about it at that point in time, and we still feel the same way.""  Now you can argue whether or not this is ok to say, makes him a sellout, or makes him ""fake woke"", but its a fairly fair stance to take imo. Most of the issues he does speak on are domestic issues, which would make sense as he probably has more experience/knowledge with those. Hell, I'm sure the average American is more qualified (even if that qualification isn't very strong) to speak about domestic issues than they are on foreign policies/issues.  Finally, the fact that this is really only lingering for Lebron while Kerr, Curry, Pop, etc have been let off is kind of telling imo. Others may have faced backlash immediately following this, but it really only seems to be Lebron who is still facing criticism and its my gut feeling that its because of more than just his comments on Hong-Kong/China.  (I highly encourage people to read this Op-ED for a more nuanced view on this whole situation: https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/what-did-lebron-james-say-about-china-nearly-everyone-else-ncna1069131)"
"They’re pros, they’ll find a way...plus we have Lebron James  that dude could probably go into cryosleep for 100 years and still play better than the rest of the league made of androids and cyborg humans."
"Yes - and I had to Google this (see link below).  The Grizzlies had traded a top 1 protected pick to the Pistons before West took over.  So when it got to the top 2, it was even more heartbreaking for West - he either got LeBron or he lost the pick to the Pistons.  Obviously, the Grizzlies drew the 2nd pick and sent it to the Pistons, who continued their string of flawless decision making by drafting Darko over Anthony, Bosh, and Wade.  https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2014/05/20/2003-nba-lottery-lebron-james-memphis-grizzlies"
My shot at All-NBA:  First Team -  - Giannis Antetokounmpo (F)  - LeBron James (F)  - Nikola Jokic (C)  - Luka Doncic (G)  - James Harden (G)  Second Team -  - Anthony Davis (F)  - Kawhi Leonard (F)  - Bam Adebayo (C)  - Damian Lillard (G)  - Russell Westbrook (G)  Third Team -  - Khris Middleton (F)  - Jayson Tatum (F)  - Rudy Gobert (C)  - Kyle Lowry (G)  - Chris Paul (G)
Just came to say that I think everyone’s definition on selling out is really soft when it comes to LeBron James
"*clears throat*  * MJ * Lebron * Kareem * Magic * Bird * Shaq * Duncan * Bill Russell * Wilt * Olajuwon * Kobe * Curry * Oscar Robertson * David Robinson * KD * Garnett * Dirk * Jerry West * Barkley * Karl Malone * Moses Malone * Wade * Erving * Baylor * Pippen * Harden * Chris Paul * Stockton * Drexler * Vince Carter * Kevin Mchale * Steve Nash * Westbrook * Ewing * Pierce * Ray Allen * Pau Gasol * Isaih Thomas * Iverson * Rodman * Dominque * Carmelo * McGrady * Elvin Hayes * Walt Frazier * Payton * Pete Maravich * Jason Kidd * James Worthy * Reggie Miller   IDK if Dwight makes the list over any of these 50, but its certainly up for debate. theres also probably people that i missed"
LeBron James is still a sellout.
none because hes lebron james. He'll get recruited after his first season in euro league to the nba
I’m definitely joking.   And I agree. This just goes to show the hate for Rudy is ridiculous. None of these players were doing anything different from their normal routine.   Lebron James even said he hadn’t changed shit in his routine.
"he has a knack for hackery. attacking certain players because he can't get access he wants, ala lebron James"
"I believe after that statement he just shut up and dribbled.   The same man who said the following 1 year earlier:  &gt;“I stand with anyone who believes in change..and I stand with Nike every day, all day,” said NBA superstar LeBron James, addressing the controversial Colin Kaepernick #JustDoIt ad that dropped Monday with the slogan, ""Believe in something, even if means sacrificing everything."""
"&gt; 5 months ago this sub loathed Lebron. The general consensus was that his image/career would never recover from the China debacle.  I'm still disgusted by the kneelers around here who say crap like ""he doesn't have to speak about issues he doesn't want to!"" and pretend like he wasn't bending over backwards for a fascist genocidal regime to make money.   LeBron James is a fool and a charlatan, and it's very annoying how the small attention span of the internet has already started to forget about this disgusting issue he took China's side on as he called Morey ""uneducated"" and despite not wanting to get in a ""word or sentence feud"" with him."

"Shannon Sharpe: We should thank One Gloria James for giving birth to her son. He has delivered the masses and is the MVP of the league for shutting it down during the Corona Crisis. Giannis can't be MVP because he is not 35 and never went through the Corona Crisis like Lebron James has done.   &amp;#x200B;  Nichols: Lebron has saved earth, not just earth but the entire solar system from this viral outbreak. He is the MVP. God Bless America, God Bless Lebron James, and God Damn Giannis."
"Corona=King=King James=LeBron Winning Chip  But why would Jaylen Brown want LeBron to win?  Jaylen to Lakers, who says no?"
There wouldn’t be a league a MVP if there wasn’t a league in the first place. It should be called the LeBron James Medal of Honor at this point.
LeBron James at 3-5 in the finals will never be the GOAT as long as the true GOAT Patrick McCaw stays undefeated (3-0!) in the NBA finals.

Uhh the best player on the Lakers is a 35 year old LeBron James and we traded the farm to get AD here this season when we could’ve signed him for free the following offseason.
"The warriors were the best team in history and dominated the league for a while, were in the finals last season, and now have the worst record in the league. It’s because people have been hurt but it’s still an odd bit  Zion sat out half the season and now is playing the best rookie year in decades  Shit got weird with China and all that controversy and Lebron James made himself look bad"
Sad that the season is suspended    Happy that LeBron James initiated playoff mode 2 times and both times he missed the playoffs.
"I’m a Nets fan but I wanted Lebron to get one more chance at a ring. NBA should consider just playing the playoffs right away once this thing hopefully dies off soon. Lebron James  I root on the side deserved this chance. I’m dossapointed as a Nets, D lo, and Lebron fan to an extent. He worked so hard and also I respected the Lakers a lot more this year. This is a huge shame. I want my team to win if possible but I don’t want Lebron to lose his legacy cause of this. I mean I am dossapointed for every NBA player."
"&gt; in all likelihood only went there to pursue other media interests outside ball  Looool are you still parroting this dead narrative? Even as we're sitting at 1st place and he's in the MVP conversation? You don't think it had to do with our assets/flexibility that could be flipped into more stars, like he's done at every stop in his career? I bet Pelinka doesn't know the salary cap, and Kidd will be head coach by ~~all star break~~ playoffs too, right?  &gt; Most of what you wrote better describes him in Cleveland. If he could make that money in Miami he’d be in Miami now  Cleveland is obviously no 1. I'm talkin LA vs Miami. None of what I said about LA, especially about him literally living here and raising his kids here, applies to Miami. And Lebron James can make however much money he wants anywhere on earth. These are baaaaad takes."
Lebron James makes several controversial statements just to back pedal on them days later.

Lebron James
"I worked as a hotel maintenance guy for years. It’s not a glamorous job and it’s crazy how many years I let go by on autopilot. I was super depressed, and that depression grew every day.  The hotel I worked at was an upscale place in Minneapolis. We often had some famous people staying there, especially sports teams as we are near Target Field and the Target Center.  One January night in 2016, I was feeling super depressed (dead end job, long Minnesota winters) when I got called to one of the nice suites. There was an issue with the heater. I go up and who answers the door but Lebron fricken James! He explains to me that his heater had just slowed significantly and it was getting cold. He was super nice and was getting ready to leave for that nights game against the T-wolves. (Man we were hyped for this Wiggins kid around then.)   So he’s in the shower/bathroom getting ready while I do my thing fixing the heater. While I’m down on my knees checking out the heater I notice something on the floor.... a toenail! I looked up at the table and on it is a toenail clippers he must have just been using. This toenail was the biggest toenail I’d ever seen, and tbh it was kind of gnarly. I quickly picked it up and looked around, I found a few more whole nails and a couple of shards. All in all I found 11 shards of nails that I believe to be his (we pretty thoroughly vacuum the suite every day). I kept them and finished my job and got out of there.  When I got home, I just sat there looking at his toe nails on my table. For the longest time I just sat there staring at them. I would roll them in my fingers, and I just couldn’t get over the fact that I had parts of Lebron James in my hand!!  After awhile I started thinking more depressing thoughts again about my job. I then thought to myself; Lebron has it all. He has family, fame, fortune and he’s very nice in person. You know, getting down on myself about the success of others.  I then looked at this gnarled toenail I was springing up and down between my fingers and realized: Lebron. James. Is. Just. A. Man. Like. Me.  He worked to get to where he is. He goes and gets what he wants. Family? Done. Fame? He crafted his story. Money? He did what he loved and held out to get paid his fair shake. He loves what he does and he loves his life, and Taco Tuesday....and yet he has to sit down.... every month.... just like me.... and clip his toenails.  For some reason it has always stuck with me. It’s kind of like realizing the president has to put his pants on in the mornings too or the Pope has to wipe himself clean in the bathroom just like you and me. We are all just people.  In the coming months I saved my money and started weaning myself off of my job I don’t like. Recently I quit and I am now following my dream: designing card games! This last winter I finally managed to step up and make the card game that when I get back from my honeymoon in two weeks will be something I can focus on bringing to full fruition. All thanks to LeBron and his [toenails.](https://imgur.com/gallery/TqUxewV)"
"Who the fuck is comparing him to barkley bedies you? Lots of people are acting like draymond would just be a random bench role player on any other team because he doesn't score  but people just ignore he is a top 5 defender in the NBA, he is one of the best passing forwards ever and he is basically on on court coach who helps direct their offense and defense.    People joke about triple singles but forget that 7 boards and 7 assists for a forward is fucking awesome especially considering his defensive dominance. Here is a list of Forwards/Centers to ever average 7 rebounds and 7 assist per game in a season   Lebron James - 10 times  Draymond Green - 3 times  Larry Bird - 3 times  John Havlicek - 2 times  Wilt Chamberlain - 2 times  Grant Hill - 1 times  Nikola Jokic - 1 time    It's not easy to do.    Don't give me the teammates argument either. Despite playing lower minutes, playing with G leaguers and dealing with being in and out of the lineup he is still averaging over 6 assits per game and over 10 assist per 100 possessions which is where he was around the previous 5 seasons."
"I don't understand why a team would ever trade an asset like Masai unless he wanted to go, which why would he want to leave when he has built one of the best teams in the league? It's like trading the Lebron James of GM's"
"The team that hasn't made the playoffs for like 7 years before this season? Who couldn't manage to make the playoffs with *LeBron James* last season?   They're looking like a contender now that they've got AD but let's be real, no one has been in LA's shadow for a while now."
"That's 3 games. Stats also won't tell you the numerous defensive hiccups and errors Leonard had against James in their last matchup.   I hate using stats, but just look at them. The fact that 35 year-old LeBron has the statistical edge on Leonard, who's allegedly reached GOAT levels according to you, is just insane.   And before you call me some big time LeBron fan, I'm not. Far from it. Just being unbiased."
"I love advanced stats as much as the next guy. But we all have to understand that they are so flawed, I mean, Kawhi had worse advanced defensive numbers than LeBron James yet Kawhi was phenomenal on that end.   Also, context needs to be added. Sure, he did beat those guys. But Joel was hobbled, it took 2 other teammates to slow down Giannis, and Fred and Kyle took the challenge of guarding Steph."
"Well look...Kawhi even has a hard time being better than a *35 year old* LeBron James. LeBron at age 28 was the absolute, undisputed top dog. Even a better defender in their age 28 seasons.   Also, LeBron had a similar path to finals in 2011 when he also disposed of a big 3/4 and beat the reigning MVP in dominant fashion.   So no, Kawhi is not on track to better than prime LeBron. He's got a hard time being better than the 35 year-old one."
LeBron James would win
I wonder people's motivations could possibly be for trying to overstate what LeBron James is doing... No idea
There were Facebook pages that would post “like this photo if you as many rings as lebron James” that would pop up in my feed every few weeks  My favorite one was right after the heat won their 3rd game of the 2012 finals I saw one that said “like this photo if you as many rings as lebron James... it might be your last chance”. Killed me
"Hi, i created a Top 100 NBA All Time list a while back, just based off career accomplishments and win share adjustments. This list is not updated in like 3 years and it is by all means not perfect, so don't roast me too hard. But I have Paul Pierce ranked 78th, so just saying it is pretty easy to argue he isn't a top 70 player all time.  1. Michael Jordan 2. Kareem Abdul Jabbar 3. Tim Duncan 4. LeBron James 5. Wilt Chamberlain 6. Kobe Bryant 7. Bill Russell 8. Magic Johnson 9. Shaquille O'Neal 10. Hakeem Olajuwon 11. Larry Bird 12. Karl Malone 13. David Robinson 14. Jerry West 15. Kevin Garnett 16.

"Hakeem, Magic Johnson, Bird, Olajuwon, David Robinson, Bill Russell, Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan, Pippen, John Stockton, Karl Malone, Dr J, Allen Iverson, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Ray Allen, Charles Barkley, Kobe, Shaq, Abdul Jabbar, Kevin Durant, Jerry West, Dirk Nowitzki, D Wade, Isiah Thomas, Steph Curry, Vince Carter, Patrick Ewing, Shawn Kemp, Gary Payton, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, Klay Thompson, Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Kevin McHale, Reggie Miller, Alex Caruso, Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, Clyde Drexler, Dominique Wilkins, Kawhi Leonard, Chris Paul, James Harden, Pau Gasol.           I don't know how many that is but you take Pierce after all those guys."
"Ray Allen for three! BAAANGG!  Iguodala to curry, curry back to iguodala, up for the layup, OH! BLOCKED BY JAMES! LEBRON JAMES WITH THE REJECTION."
"................   Kobe and Shaq weren’t a perfect fit. They anchored one of the greatest offenses ever.  You don’t have to have perfect fit when you run an incredible offense.    But let’s walk you through it.   Lebron James doesn’t move with out the ball at all. He passes to Wade or Irving. They try to create something with a stagnant offense. Is there more of a chance that you turn the ball over in a less fluid offense? Or less? IT’s OBVIOUS.   That’s the point, Lebron James lead offense is incredibly stagnant... are you trying to argue this?   But btw? Players with high portability tends to lower TO% with their teammates. So your argument goes out the window"
Reminder that the Heat had LeBron James
I think you forgot about LeBron james
&gt; Wings that will abuse the Lakers shitty small wings? Check  Yeah pretty obvious Robert Covington will dominate Lebron James
"Kawhi will be one of the weirdest First ballot hall of famers because his career stats aren’t that much but he’s still one of 4 superstars of this decade (Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Stephen Curry). He’s a two-time defensive player of the year, two-time finals MVP but he’s only a 4 time all-star, his career stats aren’t has impressive as Kyrie Irving’s or Kemba Walker’s but he’s way more reliable than both of them or Russell Westbrook and James Harden. Really weird but eh, he’s still my favourite player."
"The difference is that his name is Lebron James. MJ should not have won the '96 FMVP, and yet, there he was hoisting the trophy. Because his name was Michael Jordan."
PG: Steph  SG: James Harden  SF: LeBron James  PF: Giannis  C: Anthony Davis / Jokic / Embiid
Remember when you guys failed to make the playoffs with Lebron James on your team just a season ago. Dang that’s crazy bro
"He used to be, you weren't far off.  Iggy replaced him last winter: https://www.si.com/2019/02/18/andre-igoudala-players-association-vice-president-lebron-james-term-end"
Lebron James
"The second I heard about Kyrie wanting out of Cleveland I knew he had a screw loose. What kind of ego makes you not want to be on a team with Lebron James? I'm not even a Lebron stan, far from it, but you can be sure if I was in the NBA I wouldn't lose any sleep over being on the same team as him."
"1st NBA All Defense? NO.  But 2nd NBA All Defense? Yes.  LeBron passes the eye test and has good defensive metrics as well.  This is who I have right now:-  1st NBA All Defense:- Ben Simmons, Marcus Smart, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Rudy Gobert.  2nd NBA All Defense:- Eric Bledsoe, Jayson Tatum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Brook Lopez."
"I got bored and pondered what this would look like from current free agents:    **PG:** Milos Teodosic, Jamal Crawford.    **SG:** Dion Waiters, Tyler Johnson, Iman Shumpert, Alex Abrines.    **SF:** LeBron James, Lance Stephenson, Luc Mbah a Moute, Corey Brewer.    **PF:** Michael Beasley, Jonas Jerebko, Kenneth Faried.    **C:** Joakim Noah, Andrew Bogut.  &amp;#x200B;  Put out a starting team of LeBron, Abrines, Mbah a Moute, Brewer and Bogut to spread the floor with 3 shooters, and then have a bench of Crawford, Waiters, Shumpert, Faried and Noah for a fuck tonne of energy."
"https://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/12/kyrie-irving-i-cant-breathe-t-shirt-before-cavaliers-eric-garner-lebron-james  “I think it’s really important that we show our respect to the families,” said Irving in the locker room before the game. “More importantly we’re in the city where tragedy happened and it’s really important to us that we stand up for a cause, especially this one. It hits close to home and means a lot to me.”  Irving decided to wear the shirt two days ago.  “I was in contact with Jarrett Jack and I was like ‘I want one of those shirts and I’m going to wear it,’” Irving said.  Jack played for the Cavaliers last year.  The decision to wear the shirt was a personal one, and pregame Irving wasn’t sure if any other Cavaliers players would be wearing one.  “Obviously everyone has their own emotions towards this and what’s going on,” Irving said. “That’s all that matters. It’s just personal.  “I think more or less the condolences go out to the families. That’s the most important thing. Things happen within the world that you can’t necessarily control but for me standing up and taking it as my own and being a part of something bigger than myself…it’s just…what happened is a tragedy. I feel terrible about it but that’s just my emotions more or less for the condolences for the families.”"
"&gt; instead of attacking Kobe and even Kobe was pissed about it.  oh man, if Kobe was pissed about it then that's it, I guess.   what are you even arguing man, James is a much better clutch player than Kobe and usually chooses the smarter play...  you can be upset that you wanted to see lebron jack up a shot for fun but using an example from a 8 year old ASG is a bit ridiculous, don't you think?"
"&gt;&gt; And of those top 5 guys: * Paul Pierce: 5 game-winning assists (most all-time, no other player with 5) * Michael Jordan: 1 game-winning assist * LeBron James: 1 game-winning assist * Joe Johnson: 1 game-winning assist * Kobe Bryant: 0 game-winning assists MJ isn’t clutch like The Truth"
"&gt; Kyrie leaving Cleveland to join Boston.  That's a weird way of phrasing it. Kyrie asked to be traded and gave Cleveland a list of teams he wanted to be traded to [and Boston wasn't one of them,](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/21/16012292/kyrie-irving-trade-demand-cavaliers-spurs-heat-knicks-timberwolves-lebron-james) but Ainge traded for him anyway."
"In other news, NBA is moving to new and improved flat basketball.   It is not clear how will this affect dribbling and travel calls. When asked for comment LeBron James responded by saying:  &gt;""Travel calls? What's that?"
Yeah like Lebron James hasn’t done these exact things...
It’s not really about defense it’s about fit. harden fitting with Lebron and Cp3 is a clusterfuck. You’d have to replace Chris or James with a dead eye who just stands at the 3 point line like VanVleet or Bogdanovic
"And of those top 5 guys:  * Paul Pierce: 5 assisted game-winners (most all-time, no other player with 5) * Michael Jordan: 1 assisted game-winner * LeBron James: 1 assisted game-winner * Joe Johnson: 1 assisted game-winner * Kobe Bryant: 0 assisted game-winners"
"To me it's pretty simple.  What Durant did is like if LeBron James left the cavs to go play with Paul Pearce, Kevin garnett, and Ray Allen after losing to them the year before.   Imagine how you and everyone else would have reacted to that. Do you see how it's different from teaming up with two great players to create a brand new team?"
"""Did you know he is only 21? Jayson Tatum!""  ""Beep, bop, beep, bop, bop, beep, Kawhi Leonard!""  ""I love this guy, no homo, Nikola Jokic!""  ""Live, laugh, love. Head honcho of the James Gang. The #WashedKing, Lebron James!"""
"LeBron James definetly. Maybe Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving, but I'd say those two are a stretch. Unless Kyrie comes back or Love goes off by himself. I doubt either happen."
Iguodala to curry   Back to iguodala   Up for the layup   Oh! Blocked by James!   LeBron James with the rejection!
lebron james
"you're dragging it lol how much do you think the game has really changed since then  in his prime lebron was operating with ray allen, mike miller, james jones, rashard lewis hanging outside lol  he played with copious amounts of space then, it's not really far off from today"
"I get your post but there’s a rational that the best player should take over on the court even if it’s as simple as taking on James Harden, Giannis could’ve forced the switch to get harden on him... Like how LeBron constantly forced kemba on the switch late game"
"But your argument about the team failing year after year doesn’t work for me. Only one team wins each year. Meaning other team fails year after year.  Players like Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russel Westbrook, and Paul George. All of these guys are not winning players then. Because they have the same record in the playoffs. No wait they don’t. They haven’t won. And Lowry has. As a starter.   And you are saying that Raptors went out and got a key player in Kawhi to get over that hump? Yes. They did.   I remember Lebron James (arguably the best player ever) had to go out and create a super team to win after failing a few times. He must not be a winning player.   Your philosophy is flawed. It takes a team to win. And it takes time and the right group of players to win. Lowry is a winning player. He shows it time and time again. With stats and with the eye test."
"If you don't think Lebron did that specific dunk on purpose to honor Kobe then I don't think I could convince you the water is wet bro.    Quote from Lebron: &gt;""I didn't really predetermine that either until I jumped,"" James said. ""I just jumped and kind of figured it out, and then ... it's crazy how it's the same exact dunk, the same exact hoop that Kobe did [it on] -- what, 19 years ago or something like that? That was nice.""  And making the reference to 6th man saying: &gt;""Kobe came down, put himself in my body and gave me that dunk on that break""   I do not believe it, and it is super corny.  If you choose to believe him that's all on you, and good for you."
"LeBron ""Pau 'Jason 'White Chocolate' Williams' Gasol"" James"
"LeBron ""The Black Tommy Pickles"" James"
(1+5)\*7/(1\*(5/5))=42  42 backwards is 24  ASG was played 16-02-2020  16-02+(20/2)+0=24  Lebron James was a captain  10 (hand fingers he has)+10 (toe fingers he has)+2(arms he has)+2(legs he has)=24(things he has)  big if true
"&gt;Still believe he's the best big man in the league offensively. AD's good, but Embiid just bigger/stronger and can bully his way in the key. Not many dudes going to make Lebron James back down  He called him the best big offensively. Best offensively doesn't mean just the post."
Bruh every single Raptors player outside Kawhi looked like hot trash for games at a time in the postseason. Every single one. People were seriously wondering why FVV was an NBA player lmao. And we all know about the 0 point Lowry and Danny Green games. Even Siakam and Gasol has some shockers in the 76ers and Bucks series. Kawhi was consistently saving your ass with 30+ points but now the narrative has shifted to he was getting carried? He wasnt getting carried at any point last postseason lol.  Y’all went from getting swept by LeBron to ending the Warriors dynasty. He would’ve dad dicked LeBron like he always does if Chairman James hasn’t ran away from Cleveland.
HERE COMES LEBRON JAMES
"Still believe he's the best big man in the league offensively. AD's good, but Embiid just bigger/stronger and can bully his way in the key. Not many dudes going to make Lebron James back down"
Kawhi had a chance to win the game and he struggled with Siakam all over him. Play by play at the end:  &gt;Score: 154-153 Kawhi misses 27-foot three point jumper.  &gt;Score: 154-153 Lebron misses 26-foot three point jumper.  &gt;Score: 154-153 James Harden offensive foul.  &gt;Score: 154-153 Lebron makes driving dunk.  &gt;Score 156-155 Davis makes second free throw.
yep I figure it was some raptors/Celtics  fans not agreeing with me cause you know bias I guess. but to me having siakam (an average 3pt shooter) over someone like Middleton (who can defend pretty well also) seems useless with antetokounmmpo and embiid who needs the paint to be effective. and during some closing plays u can see team LeBron closing in not giving a damn about an embiid or siakam or antetokounmpo shot depending on who is posting up james
"&gt; The Raptors traded away DeRozan and Poetl to get Kawhi on a ONE year rental, it was risky and lucky for them it paid off because he ended up leaving anyway. The Raptors never made any moves like that while LeBron was in the East.   When was the last time any top team had a chance to acquire Kawhi fucking Leonard on a free agency? Ofc they are gonna make their move now. Raptors were already a good team at the time but they needed that something extra to win the championship. I think they are still making that trade when Lebron is in the east because Kawhi is one of the players you want to beat James.  &gt;Ok the Bucks loaded up right as Giannis went MVP mode....which was when? After LeBron left the East ok glad we agree that was when they loaded up.  Giannis finished 6th in MVP voting the last year James was in east and Bucks won 44 games that year (7th in the east). They 60 wins next year when Giannis won MVP.   &gt;Milwaukee picked up Lopez, Mirotic, George Hill and Korver.  Mirotic played 14 games for them total. Korver joined them for 2019-2020 season. Lopez and Hill were a decent pickups but if you wanna credit them for ""Bucks loading up because Lebron left"" then sure, whatever.    &gt; When did Embiid and Simmons have a full season playing together? After LeBron left the East ok glad we agree on the timeline.  It was 2017–18 season, Bens first season. They won 52 games (28 the previous season). Lebron was still in Cleveland that year. They lost to 2nd seed Boston in 2nd round who went on to play Lebron in ECF and took him to 7 games with injured Hayward and Kyrie.   All those teams were already getting good whether Lebron is in the east or not (boston almost already beat them with an injured roster).  But if you wanna say east only started getting good because Lebron left then fine, no point in arguing about that considering you're a Cleveland fan and have clear bias towards Lebron."
Lebron James and China are bffs.
"I thought you were trolling for a second but I went back in your post history a bit and it does seem that you are a bit of a purist in terms of things so I respect the consistency.  My argument is, however, that dunk contest robberies happen all the time, and even the first time AG was robbed they called it one of the best dunk contest ever.  I don't understand your point for the 3 point contest however, since around half the time you'll have players that are no where near star level winning them. Like Joe Harris last year, or James Jones in 2011 or Jason Kapono in 2007 and 2008.   The Skills Competition could use some tweaking formatting wise, but the competition itself was fun to follow this year due to it's unpredictability, with nearly all (if not all, my memory is failing me right now), of the past winners losing in the first round. The added pressure of the 3-point shoot off at the end made it intense every round.  Finally, I think the Giannis VS LeBron concept adds a very entertaining TV aspect in the form of the draft, and allows for better chemistry on the court. I think it was a necessary step for the NBA for when the Eastern Conference truly began to be buns. It balances teams out a lot more and increases competitiveness due to that.  All in all I think a close All Star Game is what the majority of the fans want, as it makes the players actually try, which everyone loves to see. Sure the first quarter(s) will always be an exhibition dunk-off and a vector of other flashiness, but when it comes down to the wire, fans are more happy when they are on the edge of their seats."
Buck fans scared AF about a 35 year old LeBron James playing great D on Giannis lmao
"lol Lebron was the one passing to Kawhi all game. Lebron, Harden, and Kawhi were all taking turns at the end Kawhi had his chances. Play by play at the end:  &gt; Score: 154-153 Kawhi misses 27-foot three point jumper.  &gt; Score: 154-153 Lebron misses 26-foot three point jumper.  &gt; Score: 154-153 James Harden offensive foul.  &gt; Score: 154-153 Lebron makes driving dunk.  &gt; Score 156-155 Davis makes second free throw."
"\&gt; he 100% sided with China in that instance.   Wrong. That right there is why this is frustrating. The ONLY fact here, the only thing that is 100% true, is that Lebron James condemned Daryl Morey's tweet. To ASSUME (because that is what you are doing) that the only interpretation of that condemnation is that Lebron supports China and thus is against free speech is, simply put, fucking stupid. It's possible, yes, that was what he meant. It is also possible (most likely) that he condemned Morey for basically turning China against the NBA. This, in turn, leads to issues such as next year's cap space projection being lower than originally anticipated. And that is just with the Rockets being blocked in China. If the NBA gets blocked in China, serious problems arise for the whole league's future. This impacts everyone associated. This is why NO PLAYERS spoke out against China. NO ONE. Why exactly do you think that is, genius? Could it be because all of these Americans secretly hate freedom of speech?   Or wait, could it be that no one wants to be responsible for inhibiting the livelihood of everyone who is associated with the NBA? If Lebron had done the opposite of condemn Morey and spoken against China, his decision would have been applauded by fans, but would have actually been a smack in the face to all of his peers by infringing on their financial security and well-being. While guys like Lebron are set, plenty of players aren't. Then you would be hearing about how Lebron was inconsiderate of the implications this would have on the league, blah, blah, blah.   He, as well as any other player in the league, has no choice but to remain silent as more peoples' livelihoods than his are at stake if he does say something. You want facts? There you go. And this is just one reason as to why he condemned Morey. Others that I have explained in detail include:  \-Lebron has only ever been described as, by peers, a genuinely good person. He has only ever (that we have seen) done positive things off the basketball court. He came from humble beginnings and rose above to make a name for himself whereby he often speaks out on social issues (one might say *employing his freedom of speech???*). I am not saying that because of these things we should overlook what he said, I am saying because of these things it is unlikely he meant what you think he meant. Good people who take advantage of their freedom of speech are unlikely to speak out against it for the sake of money. This is especially true when those people have only ever been selfless with their own money as well. This is not ""sucking lebron's dick"" as you so intelligently put it, it is making a logical and very ground argument.  \- It is also possible Lebron was just condemning Morey for all of the above and/or for starting up a shitstorm in China just before NBA teams went over there to play. This shitstorm is also, lucky for you, a fact. That happened. Many players and coaches spoke on it when they came back (lakers players and coaches did so at the same event Lebron's quote came from, actually. How crazy would it be if he was referring to the same situation as them when he was talking??? not that crazy. Actually, most definitely what happened). In this situation, Lebron is pretty justified in his condemnation. And it's even fairer in the off chance Morey apologized for his tweet legitimately of his own accord. Though he probably didn't, regardless...  So there you go. Those are the reasons (based around facts) that explain why Lebron's quote did not imply what you want oh so badly for it to imply. Of course, I've considered that you might still be so dense as to not even entertain the thought that Lebron's quote (in which he directly states absolutely nothing but a condemnation of Morey, as I have established) must be looked at with context, a sentiment that you would have learned is crucial to any quote interpretation in a high school history class. If this is the case...  You're just wrong, or a troll. It is impossible to look at Lebron's quote and declare any kind of stance on freedom of speech or hong kong. The only subject he even refers to is Daryl Morey's tweet. He doesn't talk about Hong Kong. He doesn't talk about freedom of speech. He only says that Morey wasn't educated on the situation (the most likely situation in the context of when and where the quote was taken being the NBA teams going over to China in just a matter of days following the tweet). Saying that this quote is a declaration of support for China and the inhibition of free speech is such a fucking stretch you have to actively hate Lebron to draw that conclusion.  In the end, I like Lebron and love watching him play. I do not *love* Lebron himself as I don't actually know him personally. Thus, if reasonable evidence came out that he hated the very things he's stood for his entire career, I wouldn't like him anymore. Simple as that. Do I want him to have meant what you think he meant? No, but I'm not going to force mental gymnastics on myself to maintain the current viewpoint I have of him in the face of actual contradicting facts. But there are no facts that you speak of. The only fact you mentioned was that Lebron's quote is his admittance to being on China's side, something that is neither a fact nor based in any kind of logic other than the assumption that  Lebron is a scumbag who is obsessed with money (something he has never shown indications of in the past). I hope this helped you figure it out, because there isn't anything else to say. Every single word above played a piece in constructing a grounded, logical, and fact-supported argument against what you believe and it trumps yours in every way. Notice how many more excerpts you take from my comments. That's because there is nothing to take from yours. You just waste your time saying the same redundant ""lEbRoN hAtEs FrEe SpEeCh! ThAt'S a FaCt! YoUr JuSt SaYiNg pR bULLsHiT!""   Also, the cancel culture thing. Cancel culture is when the social media mobs basically ""cancel"" someone for a single *perceived* wrongdoing. I have no agenda on this, I'm not really sure that there is one. This is just something that happens beyond the rock you live under. It's also something that definitely happened with Lebron, though it's kind of blown over as most people have realized how ridiculous it was.   If you read all this. Congrats. I spoon-fed it to you. It subsequently made my understanding of this whole situation much more comprehensive so I may go on to just make a post about it one day. Who knows... Anway, I'm done. Say whatever you want. Agree. Disagree. I don't give a shit at this point. I might read it just to see how you took it, but I won't respond. We got a lot more civil as this went on, but it kind of pissed me off how comfortable you seem to be dying on such a low hill and how vindictive you are of me by invalidating everything I say by calling me a ""Lebron stan."" Lebron is just another person. As important as it is for people not to become too obsessed with him succeeding, it's unhealthy to try and hate someone so much by performing all those mental gymnastics. Get that hate out of your heart."
"&gt; The excuses Blazers fans have for a team massively underachieving are incredible.  Yeah need a lot of excuses from a team missing 3/5 starters for the whole fucking year + more injuries lmao. Lebron fucking James missed the playoffs last year cause injuries. Like damn, you're some kind of special"
"For now, I'll only do the starters. The 4th quarter between these 2 teams would be legendary.

He has to be on team Giannis."

"I'm probably one of the biggest Gilbert fanboys there is but I'd rank Dame, Gil, Kyrie. And Kyrie and Gil are a coin flip. They're all killers tho.   It's interesting you mention Gil though, In an era where final scores were 97-84, Gilbert was dropping 30 a game and made shooting from distance trendy when it was frowned upon. And could make an argument that he best player in an NBA playoff series that featured LeBron James (2006 R1). Unfortunately nowadays people only know him as the guy who brought guns in the locker room.   Dame imo is an enhanced Arenas or what I think we would see out of Gil if he played in this era."

All they had to do was announce LeBron James’ name with the Chicago Bulls intro Music and I would be satisfied.

"Lol imagine saying kyrie&gt;dame  Kyrie will retire never having won a playoff series as the #1 guy on his team, but hey he’s a playoff god because he got to play with lebron James"
LeBron James
"If Morey is a coward, what does that make everyone else in the NBA?  Are you going to call Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, David Stern and Adam Silver cowards?"
Ages when FA opens in 2022:  James Harden - 32  Kevin Durant - 33  Stephen Curry - 34  LeBron James - 37  Kawhi Leonard - 31  Paul George - 32  Kyrie Irving - 30  Chris Paul - 37  John Wall - 31  Russell Westbrook - 33  Bradley Beal - 29  Kemba Walker - 32  Jimmy Butler - 32
"Let me know when Kyrie has a single good playoff series without playing next to Lebron James. Dame just last season led his team to the conference finals, averaging 27/7 on 57% TS. And he has ended two series on buzzer beaters in the Western Conference. Kyrie last season averaged 21/7 on 39/31/90 (49% TS) in his playoffs without Lebron James. For reference, even in 2016, Kyrie averaged 25/5 on 57% TS"
Let us know when he plays next to Lebron James.
"He was playing with Lebron James, the actual best player though"
"&gt; You addressed literally nothing and provided nothing to support your viewpoint.  The fuck?  I literally posted the relevant bit of Bron's quote and laid out my reasoning.    &gt;Obviously I was shitty in my comment  At least you're self aware.    &gt;but your’s is essentially: “Holy shit you’re ignoring facts. Fucking shit, fuck out of here.”   It's pretty funny that you say that right after, essentially, ignoring everything I've just said.    &gt;(plus the context he gave afterward   You mean the backpedaling and damage control.  &gt; I think it should be clear that he criticized Morey for making that statement just before teams went to China to play.   Ah yes, when I point out people are ignorant and uneducated, I always mean to communicate that they have bad timing.    Lebron made a stupid statement attacking Morey and backing up China, and it blew up in his face.  He backpedaled and tried to play it off as him being concerned about the timing.  No one bought it, except apparently Bron stans, because when you're annoyed about someone's timing you say so, and do not insult their education levels.    &gt;Nevermind the fact that Morey APOLOGIZED for the tweet shortly thereafter.  After a week or so of essentially nonstop pressure from China and I'm sure the NBA itself.  Seems sincere.    I really feel like I'm arguing against a Chinese propagandist at this point, tbh.    &gt;Honestly, I just have no idea how, after seeing the perspective I mentioned in the prior comment, you still think that quote (which was actually very vague) somehow is outright support of the Chinese government.  For starters?  I'm neither a Bron stan nor in the pay of the CCP.  You claim it's vague but it is really quite clear, and your half assed explanations don't really hold up to any form of critical examination.    &gt;-lebron never spoke outright in favor of china  He didn't need to, to support them.    Imagine a Bron vs. MJ GOAT debate.  Some random dude comes in and shits all over Bron's achievements, brings up that he's like 3/6 or whatever in Finals, etc.  Doesn't mention MJ at all, just shits on Bron's achievements.  That person never outright speaks in support of MJ, but clearly supports MJ's side because he's putting down the other 'side'.  Same thing Bron does.    GTFO with this weakass 'he has to explicitly do it before it counts' shit.    &gt;The could be a moot point if all this was was the NBA forcing him to say this,  'If'.  Lol.    &gt; - if any upper tier player spoke out against China,  Oh fuck off.  Stop moving the goalposts.  I've never said he should speak against China, I've only made the point that he spoke in *favor* of China.    Seriously, IDK if you really believe this garbage you're talking, but if you're going to keep spouting trash, then I'd ask you to stop misrepresenting what I'm actually saying.    &gt; - lebron has never been selfish with his money before. It is on display with his I promise school, paying for peoples’ rehab, and covering over 140 students’ college tuition to this point. - past teammates and acquaintances generally love lebron. Being in the spotlight all these years means we basically know him. He’s goofy, dedicated, a loving father and husband, and by all accounts just a good person.  No one cares.  Stop sucking his dick.    &gt;If you still think this man supports China and doesn’t believe in freedom of speech among other rights,  It's not about what I believe, it's about what he actually did.  Which was support China and oppose freedom of speech.    You keep trying to excuse this shit, and gloss over it.  No, the facts are the facts, and Lebron James 100% insulted and belittled a man who spoke up in favor of a pro-democracy, and pro-freedom of speech movement, and in doing so spoke in favor of a totalitarian oligarchy which actively oppresses human rights.    IDGAF how you justify it in your head, but he absolutely did it.    &gt;I apologize for being an asshole in my previous comment  I appreciate the apology, but I do not appreciate the spin you are trying to propagate.    &gt;Btw, cancel culture is very real  Again, I do not care what agenda you're trying to push here.    &gt;Btw, cancel culture is very real and it was on full display when that situation came up. You didn’t really come up with a valid criticism of that point   I suppose 'Fuck off, I don't care' isn't technically a 'criticism', but I think it was pretty clear what I meant."
"You addressed literally nothing and provided nothing to support your viewpoint. Obviously I was shitty in my comment, but your’s is essentially: “Holy shit you’re ignoring facts. Fucking shit, fuck out of here.” The problem with our disagreement is that we’re viewing the same statement as completely different. Listening to that whole interview/media thing with Lebron (plus the context he gave afterward and the context of the situation they were just in), I think it should be clear that he criticized Morey for making that statement just before teams went to China to play. It was well documented that it was a very tense week. [Source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2019-10-14/lakers-china-how-nba-defuse-tensions-amid-tumultuous-week%3f_amp=true)   Nevermind the fact that Morey APOLOGIZED for the tweet shortly thereafter. I guess getting an MBA doesn’t make you impervious to being uneducated on certain topics, hmm. Of course he was likely advised to do so by the NBA, but that is for the exact reason I said above. Honestly, I just have no idea how, after seeing the perspective I mentioned in the prior comment, you still think that quote (which was actually very vague) somehow is outright support of the Chinese government.   So here are my points basically: - lakers had a rough week in China due to the tweet as documented in this [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2019-10-14/lakers-china-how-nba-defuse-tensions-amid-tumultuous-week%3f_amp=true)  among others. - lebron never spoke outright in favor of china, simply criticized morey for speaking out without thinking of the implications - morey apologized for the tweet saying he hadn’t considered other perspectives. Thus making him uneducated on the matter. The could be a moot point if all this was was the NBA forcing him to say this, though the reasons he shouldn’t have said it in the first place are still valid. - if any upper tier player spoke out against China, let alone the crown jewel Lebron James, it would have serious ramifications on the league financially (which would then impact all other aspects of the league). This doesn’t just impact Lebron’s wallet (actually it probably wouldn’t impact his much at all anyway given that he’s already nearing the end of his time in the league and will likely only have one more smaller contract to go. His money is directly accounted for by the league is all but guaranteed at this point unless you think about his movie. But admit it, everyone’s going to go see that one anyway, good or bad.) There are more peoples’ livelihoods at stake here than his. - lebron has never been selfish with his money before. It is on display with his I promise school, paying for peoples’ rehab, and covering over 140 students’ college tuition to this point.  - past teammates and acquaintances generally love lebron. Being in the spotlight all these years means we basically know him. He’s goofy, dedicated, a loving father and husband, and by all accounts just a good person.  If you still think this man supports China and doesn’t believe in freedom of speech among other rights, I don’t think there’s anything else for us to say to one another. I apologize for being an asshole in my previous comment, though. I have no problem saying I am a fan of lebron, but that is for good reason. He’s incredible at basketball (the best I’ve ever seen) and does incredible things off the court to take advantage of his influence. Sue me. There are valid criticisms of Lebron, this is not one of them.   Btw, cancel culture is very real and it was on full display when that situation came up. You didn’t really come up with a valid criticism of that point so I figured I’d just reiterate it."
The economy of Cleveland is equal to LeBron James.
"Holy shit you people are annoying. The man decides not to openly chastise the entire Chinese government, an action that if done, would have impacted not only his own livelihood but that of the thousands of fellow NBA players and associates, and countless dipshits on the internet decide to pump themselves up by tearing the man down. Ridiculous. The implications of LEBRON JAMES criticizing a HUGE portion of the NBA’s market would have severely hindered the entire league for the foreseeable future. It’s not about him, it’s about all the people associated with this league who aren’t as well off already.  Lebron has paid as much money as he’s legally allowed to to build a school for those less fortunate. He’s paying for about 150 kids’ college education. Why the fuck does anyone think he’s so obsessed with his own bag?  I know, because cancel culture is the new big thing. You’ve done nothing but incredible things your whole life but you said something that can really only be viewed as controversial by people with an iq lower than kelp who have probably never read beyond the title of any article they’re oh so willing to cite as law? To the fiery pits of hell with you, garbage."
"Again, you're assuming that it's an intrinsic problem with the position. Lebron James and Kevin Durant happened to be wings. Curry happened to be a guard. That doesn't mean bigs are necessarily incapable of providing the same value."

"“They only win about 1 percent of the time. Only 1 percent of games end with meaningful made baskets,” he said. “It’s sloppy play in key situations and offensive proficiency plummets. The clock really turns the most important possession of the game into a blooper reel. You get clock controversies that drain excitement and add unnecessary controversy.”  Armed with that research, he began writing hundreds of letters and emails to everyone he could think of in the basketball and media worlds. A few wrote back praising his hard work, including a handwritten note broadcaster from Jim Nantz, he said.  But no one was much interested in adopting his idea. The hacking continued.  “It was a 10-year process of persistence and reaching out to find any way I could to frame the argument of why this is necessary and how it would address issues in the game and open up exciting possibilities,” he said.  In was in 2016 that he sent his research to the general email account of The Basketball Tournament (TBT), the annual $2 million streetball-style event that airs on ESPN.  “We get a lot of emails in that account. This one was a 67-page PowerPoint deck. It stood out because it was meticulously punctuated and well-written,” said Jonathan Mugar, TBT’s founder and CEO. “We figured out very quickly there was a lot of merit.”  Like the rest of the basketball world, Mugar was concerned about games degraded into hacking in the final minutes and how fans tire of it.  “We’re sensitive to fan experience, as upstarts on TV. I want to make sure fans are enjoying the product. Exciting games revert to very frustrating, prolonged foul-fests, so this was the perfect time to experiment, knowing it’s a huge problem,” he said. “Nick absolutely nailed it. We were compelled to get to know him.”  They talked and the tournament (with ESPN buy-in) adopted what it coined as the Elam Ending for its 2017 play-in games and has since expanded it all games. TBT uses an 8-point addition in the fourth quarter to establish the target score, and the Elam Ending format begins with the first dead ball after the fourth quarter’s four-minute mark.  “That’s a natural TV timeout slot,” Mugar said. “It has gone so well and the play so smoothly, we have not had to divert from that.”  (On Sunday, the NBA intends to make each quarter a 0-0 mini-game played to benefit local charities of the winning team’s choice, but the entire fourth quarter will be untimed and will use the cumulative score of the leading team plus 24 points – to honor the late Kobe Bryant, who wore that number – to create the final target score. So, if Team LeBron has 100 points after three quarters, the score needed to win is 124)  Mugar, who played Division III basketball at Tufts University in Massachusetts in the 1990s, calls himself a purist of the game. When considering Elam’s scheme, Mugar said he asked himself a theoretical question: If the game’s creator, James Naismith, had developed basketball in the 1890s with untimed play and target score at the end, and someone today opted to add the game clock – how would fans react?  “Fans would absolutely riot and be disgusted by the timed ending,” he said.  That was the thinking that convinced Mugar to adopt the Elam Ending for his league.  “I’m so convinced that it’s the future of basketball,” he said.  Mugar said he attributes a 17 percent bump in the tournament’s TV ratings at least in part to the introduction of the Elam Ending. He said he thinks fans are texting other fans to tell them to tune into fun games that are winding down.  Elam – he also spends spare time as a Cincinnati Reds groundskeeper and tinkering with solutions for problems in baseball – first saw his concept in action on a June 2017 weekend in Philadelphia for the opening games of The Basketball Tournament, he said.  “I went for practical reasons. I’m a researcher. I am the Elam Ending’s toughest critic. I wanted to dissect it as much as I could,” he said. “The first couple games were nothing spectacular, but I was excited by the fact the format was sound. It was working as it intended to work. You didn’t see any deliberate fouling down the stretch, no stalling.”  “Then the games started to get more exciting. It was Game 5 that came down to sudden death, which to me is any situation within three points of the target score,” he said. “The gym was starting to fill up, it was mid-afternoon. We got the Elam Ending’s equivalent of a buzzer-beater.  “I knew all along one of the biggest pushbacks was if the Elam Ending could match the excitement of a buzzer-beater. Josh Selby hit a mid-range jumper to win the game in sudden death, and it absolutely had the sound, look and effect of a buzzer-beater. There was no review at the monitor. With the Elam Ending, you get rid of all that nonsense. When someone makes a game-winning shot, you can go crazy.”  One person that’s become a fan of the Elam Ending is Chris Paul, the veteran NBA point guard now with the Oklahoma City Thunder and current players union president. He said he’s a huge TBT fan and in 2019 coached a squad in the tournament for the first time.  “For me, a guy who thinks about strategy, as I started watching the games more and more, every game had to have a game-winning shot. You couldn’t just foul. It got exciting,” he said. “In this format (for the All-Star Game), I think it’s going to be a lot of fun and an unbelievable tribute to Kobe.”  It was Paul, who is on Team LeBron as a reserve in his 10th career All-Star Game, who brought the Elam Ending to the attention of NBA commissioner Adam Silver last summer.  Evan Wasch, the NBA’s senior vice president of basketball strategy and analytics, said the league and the union, via the competition committee, soon began discussing the format’s use in the All-Star Game.  “We’re aware of things like the Elam Ending and other formats. We’ve had that on our radar for a while,” Wasch said. “We kicked around a bunch of different formats to increase the competitive incentives of the game. We basically bounced around ideas of marrying the score target with the charity element.”  The consensus was that the new format isn’t too radical of a change and potentially adds thrills to a game that has seen its TV audience dwindle.  “It’s not that big of a departure from basketball and has that playground feel to it,” Wasch said.  The game airs at 8 p.m. Sunday on TNT (simulcast on TBS) and the network said the untimed fourth quarter will be commercial-free.  Elam said he got the call from the NBA on Jan. 23, informing him that the league would be using a variation of his concept.  “When they called me, my mind started to think about some possible ways that the All-Star Game might end – a LeBron James dunk or James Harden three,” he said.  Elam also said he’s heard from sportsbooks about prop bets planned for the game – they’re going to take wagers on who will hit the final shot that gets the winning team to the target score.  “That will become one of the most popular prop bets in all of sports,” Elam said.  Mugar cautioned that someone will score the final winning basket, but fans may not see the thrill of a furious rally or traditional buzzer-beater with the Elam Ending on Sunday because a single game isn’t a proper sample size. TBT has used it in 134 games.  But if there is an exciting finish, it could pave the way to the Elam Ending gaining wider interest.  “There’s a real road to widespread adoption, if the game ends in exciting fashion. That’s going to be logged away in people’s minds. It’s not going away,” Mugar said.  There is some interest in the ownership ranks, too. The Mavericks’ Mark Cuban is among those intrigued by the Elam Ending and would like to see the league experiment further with it.  “I love that we are trying it in (the all-star game) and should use it at some point in G League games and maybe even NBA preseason games,” he said via email.  Will Elam get credit for his concept?  He’s scheduled to talk about the Elam Ending on NBA TV, but the league itself in its promotion of the game hasn’t mentioned his name. The league invited him to attend the game.  The Basketball Tournament, on the other hand, has more than acknowledged him: It uses game balls with Elam’s signature, the words ELAM ENDING and the expression “ALL GAMES MUST END ON A MADE BASKET” engraved on the ball leather.  “It’s a legacy issue and we wanted to honor him and respect the work he put into it because it’s so valuable,” Mugar said.  Elam said he’s thankful for what TBT has done to recognize him.  “They’re the ones that gave the format its name for the ending,” he said. “I was worried that something I’ve poured heart and soul into, that someone will come along and take off and run with it and leave me in the dust. Now, my name is linked to the concept.”  And the NBA?  “It’s nice that the NBA is acknowledging me behind the scenes. I just hope that they will credit me publicly as the originator of this concept,” he said."""
Of course it's relevant? Morey tweeted in support of Hong Kong. James commented on it saying Morey wasn't educated on the subject and said Morey wasn't thinking about the ramifications this had for others. LeBron chose the Chinese market over the freedom of speech and democracy Hong Kong is fighting for.  Shaq and Max Kellerman had good answers for the media on this if you need an example of what to say.
"I agree... it used to be simple, you are taking a shot and you get fouled, you get a continuation.  now it's bullshit - almost nothing is continuation. you shoot and get fouled, they just wave off the shot or hold the whistle. if you drive and get fouled, they don't call the continuation or wait to see if you missed before calling the foul. Unless you're LeBron James, then they just don't call the foul."

"&gt; 1.When you say ""brings the ball down"" what does that mean? I'm guessing it means they talk the ball from the defensive half into the oppositions half  Correct  &gt; 2.what do you mean that the pf plays ""down low""?  &gt; Im guessing wings stand outside the paint and either shoot 3s or pass the the bigs. The bigs are mainly dunkers. And the point plays as a defender mainly and feeds the ball forward to the other players. Is this right?  Not sure what you mean by ""point as defender"", but whenever possession changes due to a missed shot or live turnover, the PG is always the first guy back on defense. The other bits are correct  Forgot to note: sample of current players at each position. Most of them play differently from the classic definitions of each position  PG  - Chris Paul - classic PG  - Steph Curry - his green light to shoot from anywhere is unprecedented  - Ben Simmons - super-tall for a PG, can't shoot from the outside to defend his life  SG  - Paul George - classic SG, plays SF sometimes  - James Harden - prior to this year played like a PG  - Jayson Tatum  - Kobe Bryant - late in his career he played close to the basket like a big man  SF  - Kawhi Leonard - classic SF, plays SG sometimes  - LeBron James - plays like a PG  - Kevin Durant - as tall as a C, plays like a SG   PF  - Anthony Davis  - Giannis - handles the ball most of the time  - Draymond Green   C  - Joel Embiid  - Nikola Jokic - plays like a PG as being a conduit of the offense  - Rudy Gobert"
"I look in the mirror when I wake up in the morning and say, “Okay, Ty Lue, today is your day. This is your year. 2017 is going to be a good one!”  Then I go to work and play Lebron James as many minutes as he’ll let me."
James Harden led Houston to an 11-6 record in 2015-16 when Joey Dorsey (who had been out of the league for three seasons and was out immediately after) started. LeBron James led a dogshit Cavaliers team to the Finals in 2018. Russell Westbrook led an underwhelming roster to 47 wins and a playoff spot in 2016-17. MVP players lead their teams to success despite considerable handicaps.
"LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and maybe Damian Lillard. I'd include Doncic as well but it's only his second season."
"That wouldn't be the end all be all, but it could mean something.   It depends who is replacing them etc.   Like if Kyrie comes off the court and gets replaced by Tony Allen, that's gonna artificially inflate his numbers....as opposed to if LeBron James backs him up."

They are a Lebron James away
"I can just imagine it:   3 minutes lefts in Game 4 of the 2021 NBA Finals, Lakers up 48 points versus the Charlotte Hornets, the only team yet to be infected COVID-20 virus. And despite only having scored 19 points the entire season, u/bballworkaccount has been called up to play the final minutes by Coach Charles Barkley, the team kinda liked him because of his dope ass guac, and nobody really wanted him to die. The instructions were simple,  stay in the corner while Bron collapses the defense and T. Rozier sags off, and get ready to shoot the three. Breathing hard through his respirator, LeBron James goes to work, dribbling and bumping as he goes towards the hoop, his sneakers squeaking in the empty gym, when he suddenly sees the opening and flicks the ball to the left corner, right into u/bballworkaccount's hands. As he attempts to handle to bullet pass, his fingers hyper extending and eventfully dislocating, Rozier, recovering too quickly, bumps into u/bballworkaccount as he wildly attempts a three, causing the ref to call a 3 point foul attempt.  u/bballworkaccount misses all three free throws and sentenced to be executed the next day."

And one more time for those who don’t get it; the only time the *LEBRON FUCKING JAMES WHO IS TALKED ABOUT DAILY ON THIS SUBREDDIT*/China thing is brought up is when Rachel Nichols is brought up.
I'd be happy to die as long as I get to play with Lebron James and James Harden and Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and Kemba Walker and Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic and Damian Lillard and Russel Westbrook and Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons and Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry and Jaylen Brown and Jimmy Butler and Kendrick Nunn and Bam Adebayo and Domantas Sabonis and Derrick Rose and Paul George and Chris Paul and Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell and Ja Morant and Eric Gordon and Robert Covington and PJ Tucker and Zion Williamson and Lonzo Ball.  But most of all I'd love to play with Giannis Antauodakumpereee. He's my favorite player.

They are interested in LeBron James.
Not when LeBron James is involved and it happens in the most watched minute of NBA action possibly ever.
I can't really think of highlights and what year they were off the dome but here's what I'd have for 2017.  [Lebron james turnaround 3 pointer off the glass to put the game in OT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKipC47xWL0)
"Imagine if Trump said Ebola was an ""African disease"" and LeBron James called him out for it, do you think it will be nearly as controversial? There is absolutely a difference in treatment here.   If you say ""oh but we need to be united against the real enemy"", fine; call out anti-Asian racism like you would anti-black racism. Otherwise I see you as an enemy too just like the people you label as ""racists""."
"LeBron ""Do-a-720"" James"
"Not a problem! Yeah, KD surprises me too. It doesn't seem to slow him down, but it is still weird that he can't palm. [His hands sort of look LeBron's size](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/624820/lebron-james-left-kevin-durant.jpg)-ish, so maybe just not his thing as doesn't care to work on being able to palm?"
"Imagine there’s some LeBron James clone out there, depressed as fuck, never got a job, never got into basketball... never played it at least. Just sitting around in his moms basement, 25 years old, no idea what to do with his life. Until one day he’s walking down the streets of NYC and Dolan spots him"
1 LeBron James please
Go with Steph over that team hopper Lebron James while you're at it. Very smart decision.
LeBron James comes close
I sometimes wonder about LeBron James! His real dads last name was McClelland. If he’d stuck around he would have been LeBron McClelland... it just doesn’t seem as iconic. Plus idk if LeBron would have been the same player/person if he had a dad in his life and it’s possible he wouldn’t be the absolute legend he is today.
"Yall just have such a seething and insatiable thirst to call everything racist. I really don't get it and find the mental gymnastics to fit your narratives laughable.  I bet yall think that the coronavirus just came about a few months ago, when in fact it is just a new strain. **CO**rona**VI**rus **D**iesease **19** started in Wuhan, **China**. So this is literally the Chinese strain of the coronavirus, just like there are many strains of the Flu each year. Calling it the Chinese flu or Chinese disease or Wuhan flu is not only not racist, but is scientifically correct.  I have still yet to see a massive spike in hate crimes against the Chinese, let alone a single story. But keep peddling that narrative.   Ironically, Trump has played you all again. He constantly refers to it as the Chinese virus because he was to pressure the world against China economically. This is a country that has vast human rights violations, specifically against Muslims, and has jailed/killed journalists who tried to expose how bad this virus was a few months ago. They have also been responsible for other viral outbreaks in the past.  Finally, fuck the NBA, fuck LeBron James, fuck Jeremy Lin, and fuck the rest of these multi million and billionaires who consistantly choose millions of dollars from the Chinese market over standing up for human rights."

"LeBron's been making sure the kids at his school still have all their resources while the school is closed.  Not sure what you want him to say - I love Kevin Love (check the flair) but literally all he did was say ""wow that sucks, I want to help.""  https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/03/15/how-lebron-james-i-promise-program-helps-during-coronavirus-outbreak/5051931002/"
I'm pretty sure this same question was asked about LeBron James if his name was LeBron Jim.
"Something that unusual would definitely garner extra attention, just like ""Zion"" does. If his name was something really common like James or Chris, he would definitely have received less attention. He would still attract a lot of attention because of his sheer amount of talent, athleticism and his exciting style/level of play, but having Zion as his first name is definitely a helper. I'm sure being named LeBron was help to LeBron as well, and same argument for Kobe too."
"This plays well into my long-held theory that a players name DOES impact their career. Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Jerry West, and Larry Bird are ALL names that would make for an amazing sports movie protagonist. Not so much for Ralph Sampson, Andrea Bargiani, or Hasheem Thabeet."

"\&gt; there's two examples of a top 10 player ever in his prime, regardless of  how good his teammates are, missing the playoffs in a season where they  played atleast 70 games.      \&gt; LeBron James got to the Finals with G-Leaguers   &amp;#x200B;  If you compare the Cav's 2018 roster to the Bucks 1974 roster, the Cavs had four players (besides Bron) posting a postive BPM - and Love rated out at 3.3. The Bucks had *two* positive players, with Dandridge (the BPM leader on the team excluding Kareem) posting a **0.6**. The story's pretty much the same across other advanced stats or more simple box scores (p/36 goes 23/20/20/20/18/17/17 for the Cavs and 19/18/15/14/14/14/14 etc.), and the '75 Lakers were *even worse* than the Bucks the year before - not a single player (excluding Kareem) had a positive BPM score, Love, Thompson, Korver and Green had more WS/48 than any non-Kareem Laker.   &amp;#x200B;  Again, success in basketball is a **team** thing, and as bad as the 2018 Cavs roster was, the teams Kareem was on - where you're acting like missing the playoffs is a damning indictment of him as a player - were even worse. Kareem's impact didn't fluctuate too much across the years where he missed the playoffs or led his teams to the playoffs as a rookie and won their first series; Jordan's team lost in the first round of his rookie season, and his team made the playoffs more-or-less without him in his second season.   You could go back and forth on the team stuff like that pretty much indefinitely, but again, it's irrelevant because the point of this list was to use extensive statistical analysis and sample-based eye tests to rank players based solely on *cumulative* **individual** contribution.   And just on those last three words, we should never have needed to have this conversation because it shouldn't have surprised you that Kareem's **nineteen** seasons would total up higher than Jordan's (or even Bron's) fourteen. Like, you'd need to think that Jordan's seasons were, on average, 135% better than Kareem's for that to be the case, and presumably you don't think Jordan is like Kareem if Kareem was a whole other one-third-of-a-Kareem better, right?"
"I'm definitely going to have to do some research on this, but the facts presented here are damn compelling.    Edit:  after searching basketball reference, Nate Duncan articles, and reading bill simmons book of basketball, it seems that LeBron James is indeed in the conversation for the best player ever for the Cavs."
not since op presented a very solid case for why lebron james is arguably the greatest cav of all time.

"Yeah and I never counted those Championships, that’s why I was talking about his Thunder days. Also while Khawi is an all time defender, KD is the greatest offensive player this side of Jordan. Moreover this notion that offense and defense are equal is simply ludicrous. Would you rather have Steph Curry or Rudy Gobert? Would you rather have Draymond Green or Trae Young? Would you rather have Joakim Noah or James Harden? Would you have Marc Gasol or Damien Lillard. Would you rather have Carmelo Anthony or Tony Allen. Hell even LeBron was still the best player in the world while putting minimal effort on defense a couple years ago. Amazing offense will beat amazing defense most of the time."

Yeah that's why Melo graduated one year earlier than LBJ despite being both born in 1984.   Some other examples that are similar age to LBJ:    **Class of 2002**  Chris Bosh (March 1984)  Carmelo Anthony (May 1984)  **Class of 2003**  LeBron James (December 1984)  Chris Paul (April 1985)  **Class of 2004**  Dwight Howard (December 1985)  Kyle Lowry (March 1986)
"\#3 is just wrong. KD has been seen has LeBron's equal as far back as 2011 and they were as close to 1a and 1b as any players in the league till Steph Curry came along. Look at this article from 2012, when KD was only 23 years old:  [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1283009-breaking-down-the-differences-between-lebron-james-and-kevin-durant#slide8](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1283009-breaking-down-the-differences-between-lebron-james-and-kevin-durant#slide8)   KD has had years of regular seasons that always put him neck at neck with LeBron, Kawhi has not reached that level, and he also has not played LeBron in the playoffs since he became a superstar (2016-2017), while KD has and has shown up every time. This year was probably the best year for that to happen but unfortunately coronavirus came up"
"You make a good point and I don't think you should be downvoted just for clarifying what a vet is - it's not like you said Lebron James is bad.  The only argument I'll make is that becoming a veteran isn't a function of time but of experience, which of course correlates heavily with time. If he was forced into a ""leader"" role for the first two years, then you could make an argument that he gained experience that most players would take years to get. But people shouldn't just quote his scoring stats and accolades to make that point - the whole team's chemistry comes into play."

"I don't deny his numbers and individual play, i deny his impact after Oscar Robertson's retirement and before Magic arrived.  What i'm saying is simple, there's two examples of a top 10 player ever in his prime, regardless of how good his teammates are, missing the playoffs in a season where they played atleast 70 games.  Wilt in 1963 and Kareem in 1975, Kareem also did it in 1974 but in only 65 games played, but he has a factor against him that makes his case even worse, he did in the 70's, an era of the NBA were the talent was diluted with the ABA and you had all time greats not playing against each other.  My point is straightforward, Kareem achieved less than other all-time greats when he didn't play with one of the top 3 point guards in history, he missed the playoffs in an era that was far weaker than any before or after and while he put up crazy numbers, you can't just gloss over the era he played in and his level of success without Magic or the Big O.  LeBron James got to the Finals with G-Leaguers in a much harder era, Michael never missed the playoffs even when he played with cocaine addicts in also a harder era, Kareem missed the playoffs when he didn't have an all-time great PG."
"You forgot the classic: ""LEBRON JAMES, WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE!"""
"&gt; Except he's not better at individual shot-creation, playmaking, shooting, offensive rebounding  They average the same amount of offensive rebounds, not sure what you mean there. Jokic isn’t great at creating his own shot either, he’s not athletic or quick enough and can only really do it if there is a size mismatch. I think you’re confused about what “creating your own shot” actually means.  The Lakers are worse without LeBron because he is LeBron fucking James, don’t be dumb. He dragged the Kyrie-less Cavs to the finals. Any team in the league is going to be way worse without him on the floor.   &gt; Being an elite putback/lob finisher and getting fed layups isn't gonna help carry a team. You're not gonna run an elite offense around a big who can't create for himself at an elite level, can't pass at a high level, or shoot well. Davis does literally none of those things at a high level.  Huh, that didn’t seem to stop him when he dragged Jrue Holiday and a bunch of subpar players to the conference semis against GSW.  &gt; Yeah he would, because his skillset is far more conducive to creating for his teammates  No he wouldn’t, because playmaking doesn’t mean shit if your team has zero spacing. That’s the whole point.  Your only argument boils down to on/off stats, which as I’ve said are very flawed and highly dependent on the players around you. If we went by that metric (net rating for instance), Brook Lopez, Marc Gasol, Porzingis, Hayward, and Dorian Finney-Smith (to name a few) are all more valuable than Jokic.  When so many people disagree with you, it might be time to consider that you’re just wrong."
"Let's see:  1. Overheard in Cavs locker room after Game 7: “He got me,” LeBron said of Tatum's dunk over him. ""That f***ing Tatum boomed me."" LeBron added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times. LeBron then said he wanted to add Tatum to the list of players he works out with this summer.  2. After stunning players in a film session with a verbal suggestion that they were no longer playing “like a bunch of thugs,” Cavaliers coach John Beilein reached out individually to players tonight to insist he meant to use the word “slugs.”  3. ""Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!” Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”  4. That's what happens when someone smaller, younger, and less athletic than you takes your crown AND throne. And then makes you dance for his amusement.  5.

"The hype behind LeBron was insane, Zion didn't even come close to the impact James had."
"It's not just the Bucks or Clippers this season. Dudes like James Harden and Russell Westbrook have carried sub-par rosters with little to no shot-creation aside from themselves to the playoffs. They're actual MVP players. You can place a bunch of shooters/defenders with zero other offensive skills around players like that and they'd make the playoffs. Davis lacks the playmaking ability and scoring self-creation to do that.   &gt; And Jokic is surrounded by a pretty good team as well, so does that mean we can downplay his success as well? You can’t have it both ways.  No, since the team goes from elite with him playing to barely treading water without him.   &gt; Uhhh, what?  Davis isn't an elite playmaker, he's not a great shooter, and the vast majority of his buckets are assisted. He isn't the offensive powerhouse that someone like LeBron or Jokic is. A big isn't gonna lead your team to a championship-level offense in today's NBA unless he possesses skills like Jokic, who is one of the most unique players ever."
"So why is it that LeBron can keep the Lakers a top-tier team without Davis but the reverse isn't true? Even if the Lakers' role players are mostly just shooters/defenders, any elite player should be able to carry them to at least mediocrity. LeBron James, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and actual elite players have been doing it for years."

"The Cavs moved Lebron to the mid-range. His jumper was fluid and smooth. He finished the game by hitting turn-around fadeaways. He splashed his first shot just inside the arc.  ""How could you not double team?"" he shouted at the Raptors.  He swished another.  ""Look how good I am!""  Another ripped through the net.  ""You need to guard me, DeRozan!""  A fourth make.  ""Come on, DeMar, you gotta guard me!""  A fifth.  ""I'm so good!""  A sixth.  ""I gotta be No. 1!""  A seventh.  ""How can you guard me?""  Smiles swept across the faces of Dan Gilbert and the rest of the Cavaliers brain trust. Gilbert would later tell people that it was the best game he'd ever seen. ""He was like the second coming of Hakeem,"" he'd say. His mind was made. ""He told us there, this time, he was keeping James a Cavalier for life,"" said Rich Paul, one of Lebron's agents at the time."

I mean LeBron was put into private school at age 12 to focus on basketball. He had Tim Grover (MJ's personal trainer) and lots of other Nike pro coaches and resources molding him and building habits and routines into him to become the best player they can make. Literally no player in history had the amount of resources and time put into making them great at basketball than LeBron James.

"whatever helps you sleep, but it was MJ's league until shaq took over in LA with his own 3-peat, then in 2003 lebrons' era started. he literally had more points than kobe his 1st and 2nd year in the league while already facilitating at a level kobe was never able to  by the time kobe peaked with his monster season, he had become james harden in lebron's world, just like today  throw in a shaq/wade championship and there were questions about if kobe was even the best SG, but he was, he just wasn't the best player.  it went from MJ to shaq to lebron. kobe started his career coming off the bench and was the #2 on his team to shaq, then shaq left and kobe grew but lebron was already putting up 31/7/7 in his 3rd season.  for me, kobe helped carry MJ's torch because he had a similar playstyle and literally modeled his game after him, but it went from MJ to shaq to lebron and it's still lebron's league  you can feel differently, but i've been watching games since the early 80s before anyone knew who MJ was. it never felt like kobe's league and nobody ever insinuated it. better players overlapped his whole career and he took a few years to be in the 'great' conversation. lebron ws in the great conversation before he could legally drink alcohol  i mean, the year kobe ""made it"" was the year before lebron won 4 of the next 5 MVPs  kobe lost 2 MVP opportunities to the shittiest MVP candidate in history and kobe SHOULD have won at least one of those, but like i said, the league started becoming obsessed with what the suns were doing out west with their efficiency and pace  kobe just was never the best player of any era no matter how you slice it"

"Darko gets more attention than those guys because of the drafts he was picked in and who he was directly picked ahead of.  He was picked behind LeBron James and ahead of 3 perennial all-stars in what is regarded as one of the best drafts of all-time.  In hindsight thabeet also sticks out for being ahead of harden and curry, but I think it helps that those guys took several years before it was obvious they’d be elite players whereas it was quicker with the guys behind darko, the player he was drafted behind, while good, is not in GOAT discussions, and while he was take directly ahead of harden, there were 3 other guys taken before curry.  The timberwolves picking both Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn directly ahead sticks out more to me as a hilariously bad decision."

"out of curiosity, because i genuinely cant remember, i checked some pre-2016 finals rankings to see where he was ranked all-time  [third behind jordan and kareem during 2016](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankalltime/greatest-players-ever)  [sixth behind bird, kareem, magic, russell, jordan after 2013](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1795233-10-greatest-nba-players-of-all-time#slide5)  [first in 2015, but jesus christ these rankings are awful](https://www.britannica.com/list/the-10-greatest-basketball-players-of-all-time)  [fifth during 2016 behind jordan, kareem, wilt, magic](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/02/08/michael-jordan-lebron-james-stephen-curry-nba-greatest)  seems to be more variance now than today for sure, but idk about ""back half of the top 10"""
"KG was more a Karl Malone, than a Lebron James. I don't think he ever really qualified for best player in the league over Jordan, Shaq, Duncan, Kobe, Lebron."
LeBron has never won a ring without James Jones
"That's literally what he said the first time he was asked....  [“We play games without the fans? Nah, that’s impossible,” James said. “I ain’t playing if I ain’t got the fans in the crowd. That’s who I play for. I play for my teammates, and I play for the fans. That’s what it’s all about. So if I show up to an arena and there ain’t no fans in there, I ain’t playing. They can do what they want to do.”,](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/amp/league/article/2020/03/07/coronavirus-lebron-wont-play-empty-arenas)  That's all ego, especially when you consider the circumstance. Those are safety precautions for both the players and the fans, but he just wants a quote saying ""I only play for my fans"""
"What are you even ranting up about James already said weeks ago he changed his mind &amp; now even suggested they play 10 more regular season games for all the teams still in the hunt then to start the playoffs. People always go on with this “if (insert athlete) lived in the real world his life would be harder so shut up &amp; play” when in actual reality these players have more leverage than we can dream of so they would be idiots not to use it. LeBron also has been watched by thousands of people since middle school it’s not hard to see why he thought it was weird af to play without fans what would be the point, he even said you can’t have fun beating the home team if there’s no fans to watch it  It won’t be safe nationwide sports for a long time, it’s not just the on court shit where you need a camera crew, bench, Ref, coaches &amp; general staff on hand but the constant traveling to each state to play different teams puts a shitload of different people at risk. If it’s not safe to watch a game of basketball why would anyone think it’s safe to play it?"
""" if they die, they die""  - Lebron James and RJ Barrett"
"Jay Will’s take sounds insane and tone deaf. But I think he is going under the assumption that:   **Leagues will be cleared to play but just not in front of crowds** (more on that in a sec)  I hate duke but I’ve grown to like jay Williams and I literally have never questioned his stances, biases, ir intellect. He’s a perfect balance of pro-player but not a homer, also woke, media savvy, etc. He’s legit, so I give him the benefit of the doubt that he’s assuming , like most, that there will be a time where leagues are cleared but crowds aren’t.   But about that...I think the whole sports world is naive. In what scenario will state governments clear players —-who are non essential—-while the rest of the world is quarantined? Kirk Herbstreit is the first a d I believe only sports person to speak logically when he said he’d be shocked if the NFK and college football play at ALL this year. Everyone else is buggin.  Do they not understand NY is about to be on some ish we’ve never seen? If crowds aren’t safe why would a gathering of 10 people (on court) play? Plus their staffs which would be another 20-30. You’d have to do what the big 3 is doing and create a bubble and of course that’s not gonna happen . Some states have(will) Bam gatherings of over TWO people. *Two!!**  So then you look at, you’d have to test before every game. Since people will be out in the world between games. Even if it’s to go out and go back home, you never know. And over the course of 2 months, somebody would probably rest positive again.   Well, what happens when one, ONE , player tests positive after 2 days away. Even if you feel that 1 player is disqualified, you can’t do that bc then you’re placing value on players. Ie, They’d tell *Jordan McRae* he can’t play and his team plays without him, but if it’s Lebron James they’d probably wanna shut them league down again. Slippery slope   So sports leagues are still going by that ‘play without fans’ mentality but that’s a month outdated. NOW, it’s pretty apparent that sports leagues can’t get started until the world gets started and that may be some time"
LeBron 'Michael Phelps' James
"""I'm never quite sold on his mental toughness... 17 players toughed it out and only LeBron James cramped”  -Skip Bayless after LeBron’s cramp game in the 2014 finals   Apparently cramps, an involuntary contraction of muscle, is caused by someone’s mentality about a sports game lmao"
LeBron James with regard for human life
who said lebron James has no regard for human life?
"LeBron James is the best basketball player in history. Anyone who disagrees has another agenda, completely ignoring the best player ever in front of their eyes."
Trae Young Stephen Curry Lebron James Prime Kevin Garnett Karl Towns
Their +10 list is:  Tim Duncan  Kobe Bryant  LeBron James  Allen Iverson  Kevin Garnett  Dirk Nowitzki  Dominique Wilkins  Bob McAdoo  Dwyane Wade  Kevin Durant
"Wow, Lebron James is such a great guy! The one person who can claim the mantle Superman, unlike Shaq and Dwight Howard."
"Trae does not deserve All-NBA. For  Guards who you have Trae over?: Russell Westbrook, Ben Simmons, James Harden, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Lebron, Doncic, Kemba, Mitchell???   His biggest thing is that he’s got good stats, but those stats haven’t won him games whereas most of these players are leading to winning teams."
Lebron James
"I know its fun to make fun of Draymond, but he is one of the best defenders of all time. Chuck would obviously win the matchup but he would not “make Draymond his bitch”  And if a team led by Lebron James, that was perfectly tailored to fit him couldn’t beat 2017 GSW, neither will this team. They have absolutely no answers for Steph and Klay, and if Pippen is put to guard any of the two, KD will go off every single time. While Houston (arguably) has more star power, the Warriors roster just fits so perfectly that it negates any advantage the Rockets have. They are arguably the best team in history for a reason."
This story actually came out 2 years ago but Gabrielle union told CBS but didn't mention it was Melo u dumbtard https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/gabrielle-unions-story-lebron-james-once-saved-a-man-from-drowning-in-ocean/

Certainly not the last time LeBron James upset the Warriors
"On the other hand, a single player can carry a franchise in the NBA much easier than it can an MLB or NFL franchise.   Prime LeBron James would have to be a 20 win pitcher, a 30hr 120rbi hitter, and be able to cover the entire outfield defensively, plus he somehow makes everyone else hit slightly better somehow, to have similar value as a baseball player."
LEBRON JAMES WITH REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE!

lebron james is lebrons  james
lol they tried to hide the fact that it was Melo when the story first came [out](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/gabrielle-unions-story-lebron-james-once-saved-a-man-from-drowning-in-ocean/). They made it seem like it was some random friend.
"Bron didnt just have a better finals lmao. James had the most legendary finals performance of all time. That alone makes him top the list. Kawhi went down to THE LAST POSSIBLE SHOT in the 2nd round lmao. Dirk beat Kobe's lakers, the durant thunder, and the LeBron Heat."
"Kawhi didn't really have to go up against that tough of competition:  Round 1: Nikola Vucevic  Round 2: Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons  Round 3: Giannis and Khris Middleton  Finals: Steph Curry, and a few games of Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant.  &amp;#x200B;  Dirk went through:  Round 1: LaMarcus Aldridge, Brandon Roy  Round 2: Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Andrew Bynum  Round 3: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden  Finals: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh  He faced 3 of the top 5 players in the NBA (Kobe, LeBron and Wade, the other two being Dwight Howard and Derrick Rose)."

But a lot of the research has suggested a prime of 25-30.
PG: Allen Iverson  SG: Tracy McGrady  SF: LeBron James  PF: Kevin Garnett  C: Yao Ming  I'd say this team could probably win 70 games.
So this kid helped James get his first ring.   Ray Allen got James his second.  And Kyrie got James his third.  Does Lebron do anything himself?
"LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Zion Williamson, Dwyane Wade, Tracy McGrady, Shaquille O'neal  &amp;#x200B;  Dope names"
"LeBron James: 28 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists, 3 steals   JaVale McGee: 33 points, 20 rebounds, 1 steal, 6 blocks   D'Angelo Russell: 21 points, 2 rebounds, 13 assists, 4 steals   Lonzo Ball: 12 points, 6 rebounds, 8 assists, 5 steals   Chris Paul: 29 points, 4 rebounds, 7 assists, 2 steals, 1 block  Honorable mentions   Paul Millsap: 13 points, 11 rebounds, 5 assists, 3 blocks   Kyle O'Quinn: 16 points, 6 rebounds, 3 assists, 4 blocks   Wilson Chandler: 19 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists, 2 steals, 2 blocks"
"Honestly, if you swapped Kobe and Shaq itd be a damn good list. But Shaq at 9 is pretty egregious. There's no argument for Kobe over Shaq.  Edit: I'll put my list  1a) Michael Jordan  1b) Lebron James  3) Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  4) Shaq  5) Magic  6) Larry Bird  7) Tim Duncan  8) Kobe  9) Bill Russell  10) Wilt Chamberlain  11) Hakeem Olajuwon   12) Stephen Curry  13) Kevin Durant  14) Oscar Robertson  15) Karl Malone  16) David Robinson  17) Moses Malone  18) Kevin Garnett  19) Dwyane Wade  20) Dirk Nowitzki  21) Jerry West  22) Charles Barkley  23) Julius Erving  24) Elgin Baylor  25) Kawhi Leonard"
"I also value differences in defenses between eras. Kobe was tearing up the league and averaging 35+ during an era when perimeter defenses were stifling. How many elite perimeter players did Jordan go against? Reggie Miller? Uh....Kobe faced: AI, TMac, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Carmelo, Kawhi Leonard, Lebron James, Dwyane Wade...list goes on, almost every night it’s a tough perimeter matchup. These are all time players. Jordan dominated an era dominated by big men. And even the elimination of hand checking and illegal defenses changed things. Kobe/Lebron have faced tougher teams and tougher dogs on the perimeter than Jordan did. Just my two cents."
1. LeBron James 2. Kobe Bryant 3. Dirk Nowitzki 4. Kevin Durant 5. Steve Nash 6. Damian Lillard 7. Vince Carter 8. Tracy McGrady 9. Deron Williams 10. Dan Dickau
"Eric Bledsoe, James Harden, Lebron James, Zion Williamson, Deandre Jordan"
"His assists and turnovers were the exact same as Rookie LeBron James, and I've never heard anyone claim he had ""below average"" playmaking as a Rookie. That's a better Assist to Turnover ratio than James Harden this season.  Jordan was also already one of the best rebounding Guards in the League, with 6.5 total rebounds per game including a ridiculous 2 offensive rebounds per game."
"I would 100% take these 11 guys ahead of Webber's NBA career (which was like 4 really good seasons, then 5 seasons of decent/good yet injury prone starter)  1. Tim Duncan 2. LeBron James 3. Kobe Bryant 4. Dirk Nowitzki 5. Dwyane Wade 6. Kevin Garnett 7. Steve Nash 8. Jason Kidd 9. Allen Iverson 10. Dominique Wilkins 11. Bob McAdoo 12. Dwight Howard 13. Carmelo Anthony?  I guess he could sneak in with top 15, but will quickly be knocked out by guys like Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden"
"That was my reply because every response was cherry picked.  Starting with the LeBron quote, he only quoted LeBron in a disingenuous and favorable way.  What he quoted wasn’t the statement that led to backlash from fans.    The quote in question:  ""I don’t want to get in a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey. But I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke,"" James said before the Lakers’ preseason game against the Golden State Warriors on Monday at Staples Center. ""So many people could have been harmed, not only physically or financially, but emotionally and spiritually. Just be careful what we tweet, what we say and what we do. We do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative things that come with that too.""  [Source.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/3982048002)   Honestly it’s a valid question.  Why is an account with heroic levels of karma constantly deleting all of their posts / comments, and why are they so dedicated to defending LeBron / the NBA / China.  There’s a lot of shill accounts on this website, I think it’s possible this is one of them, but maybe it’s just a coincidence."
"Shannon who calls LeBron, GOAT James and roots for the Lakers/LeBron's teams probably has no bias in this."
"I think the Rockets are right there, whether PJ Tucker at center is gonna work or whether they need an actual shooting big. However, they keep on coming across juggernaut after juggernaut. First it was the KD Warriors, now it’s LeBron James"

Cavs. Two words: Lebron James and Kyrie Irving must see basketball.
"Let's first scrutinize your last point that Gary Payton gave Michael Jordan trouble over the course of his career. I really urge you to watch the games where Payton guards Jordan (which is rare, he was generally being double-teamed even when Payton was on him). This particularly began in the 1993 season.  Let's look at Jordan's statistics in these games:  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/h2h_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;p1=paytoga01&amp;p2=jordami01&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#stats  Jordan's statistical output actually INCREASED on average after he began being defended by Payton during Payton's career with the Sonics. This includes a 45-point explosion (""George Karl game"") in the season following the 1996 finals, the highlights of which are below. There is no doubt that Jordan struggled in Games 4 and 5 of the 1996 Finals, when the ""switch to Payton"" was made. But if we really watch those games, is Jordan missing shots when he is being defended by Payton 1-on-1? He is not. We need to be honest with the footage:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNuTG1ARzo  As to your point about Jordan's defensive competition, what we really need to put together is a table depicting Jordan's performance against the top team defenses every year of his career. His 50-point games actually predominantly occurred against top-10 defenses each season, as opposed to bottom-20 defenses. This is not the case with Kobe Bryant, for example, and I have not looked at such data for LeBron James."
Would the Knicks get better if they replaced Kevin Knox with Lebron James
"Lebron, KD, Kawhi are way bigger threats on offense. James Harden meanwhile often shoots his team out of the game. Those 3 that I named pretty much never do that."
"His Career Playoff PPG is by far the most impressive record he holds:  1. Michael Jordan 33.45 2. Allen Iverson      29.73 3. Jerry West          29.13 4. Kevin Durant      29.09 5. LeBron James   28.92  He is the only player on the list that has an average of 30+ PPG and the next closest player, Iverson, is nearly a whole 4 points behind him!  Just show the man did it better than anyone else during the most important time of the season."

"The comment about Morant and Zion is just stupid, look at New York and how the operation is ran, it is terrible. You don’t know how these teams will end up turning out, which could lead to situations the “rigged” NBA would want, maybe New York is meant to wait until a player (like lebron James jr) is available to draft, nobody knows"
"Our broadcast often refers to him as James throughout the game. They use Harden more, but they do still use his first name sometimes. It gets very confusing when we play LeBron."

"Congratulations, one man didn't get fired. I feel sorry for you if you're deluded enough to really think that means the NBA said fuck China and cut all ties or boycotted them in any way. In reality the NBA apologized and bootlicked like there was no tomorrow to ease tensions to games shown on Tencent and state TV again, y'know, exactly like what LeBron did. Almost like the face of the league parrots the league's stance. It's his choice but not a choice he made alone.   And for the record his awful heinous words were essentially ""could have waited a week to send it."" in response to the shitstorm several NBA teams that were there in China had to face as the situation unfolded. Yet I'm hearing PeKing James as if he actually took a side. And just like Popovich, the owner of the Nets, Kerr and Curry, LeBron claimed he lacked the knowledge to offer an opinion. Five crosses then I assume? We'll do it in Golgotha like we did Christ. Doc Rivers literally said ""freedom of speech does not mean freedom of consequences"", but now you're here selling me some bs narrative about how LeBron snaked the entire league and became a communist.  Your ""we live in a society"" dross is almost as laughable as it is naïve. The NBA is not a freedom fighter, LeBron is not a freedom fighter, the company that makes shoes he wears aren't freedom fighters. I'm sorry to have to drop all of this on you at once but this is the real world where cash is king. This doesn't mean good people don't exist but when push comes to shove they all bow down."
Players growing up watching and idolizing Kobe are in the league they mirror their game after him and it’s probably why they got into basketball. As Lebron James gets older and retires I would assume a new generation growing up watching him play will do the same towards him.

In the grand scheme of things they probably don't care about LeBron James opinion. He doesn't have an actual impact on their lives as much as we want to believe he does.   Do they care about their situation and independence? Yes definitely. Do they care about what LeBron has to say about it? No not really.

"That’s just bullying bro, going through a long day of geometry and biology just to be the primary defender of having to defend someone who’s literally LeBron James"
"That is why, although Finals MVP is important, people put way too much stock on that award. It represents one out of the 4 matchups in the playoffs. People always wanna disparage the rest of the team over the one who won the award. They then discredit the body of work that was done the previous 3 matchups.  As long as NH boy Steph is part of the MVP &amp; Title in the same year crowd, I am happy. Only 6 or 7 others {in the modern Era} are part of that club. In order going backeards: Steph Curry, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Magic Johnson &amp; Larry Bird.  That is exceptional company."
"I mean, yeah, Jayson Tatum isn't Lebron James."
"He was injured the entire playoffs, so this was a miracle run that ended because of LeBron James."
I'm talking more specifically about LeBron James
"LeBron's already said the shutdown is not good for his body [LA Times article](https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2020-03-26/lakers-lebron-james-says-layoff-not-good-for-35-year-old-body)  &gt;“My body was like, ‘Hey, man, what the hell is going on? It’s March 13. You’re getting ready for the playoffs. Why are you shutting down?’” James said. “I was right there turning the corner. I feel like I was on third base.”"
"&gt;Video is talking about entire league shutting down, no mention at all of LeBron James  &gt;top comment: BUT WHAT ABOUT LEBRON'S NUMBERS  Thread later this week with 15k upvotes and 2,000 comments: WHY TF DO ESPN AND BLEACHER REPORT OBSESS OVER LEBRON AND THE LAKERS AND NEVER COVER SMALL MARKET TEAMS, ESPN ON THEY BULLSHIT AGAIN"
"Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James"
"Yeah I know, but it's just worded differently. I knew what he meant, but if you read it literally and didn't know that James Jones retired but you knew Lebron was on the Lakers, you'd have assumed James Jones also played on the Lakers."
Oh.... daily reminder Lebron James is the goat 🐐
"IMO Lebron is definitely not in that conversation. Lebron's passing is a product of his scoring. You simply cannot defend Lebron James one on one. Lebron is a great passer, but he is not in the Magic or Stockton echelon of playmaking. He's simply a bigger scoring threat."
1. LeBron James  2. Steph Curry  3. Kevin Durant  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. James Harden  6. Russell Westbrook  7. Chris Paul  8. Paul George  9. Klay Thompson  10. Dirk Nowitzki  Gotta include Dirk for carrying that 2011 championship run. I'd put DWade and Dwight Howard in the previous decade. Dwight's peak was relatively short.
"I know many to consider Tim Duncan as a top 10 player of all-time and the best or 2nd best power forward ever (Karl Malone being the argument for 1 or 2). I think he is somewhat the “Derek Jeter” of the NBA as far as legacies go. Model citizen, organization built for winning championships every year, solid coaching staff (Popovich being top 3 in NBA history, arguably 1 or 2), and other Hall of Fame talents around him during his career (Robinson, Parker, Ginobili, Leonard). Don’t get me wrong his numbers and accolades speak for themselves over his illustrious career but I believe many players in his era were more talented but in worse situations to win and/or not as compliant to play for a coach with a militaristic style. For example, I believe the following players in his era were far more talented despite position differences for some...LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett, Allen Iverson, Dwyane Wade, Jason Kidd, Jermaine O’Neal, Chris Webber, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Steve Nash, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul to name a few."
"1. Lebron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Chris Paul 5. James Harden 6. Kwahi Leonard 7. Russell Westbrook 8. Paul George 9. Klay Thompson 10.

I also feel like Kawhi didn't play enough game, but I can see people put it as high as 4th.   Other Options:   1. Draymond Green, Kyle Lowry, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Damian Lillard   Just need a few more space 2. Antony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, Kemba Walker   They were losing games  3. Al Horford, Paul Millsap, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall   They were winning games, they will be in the ""Hall of Very Good"" 4. Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Dewayne Wade, Kobe Bryant, Tony Parker, Steve Nash, Manu Ginobili, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Rose, Deron Williams   They still had some great years, but they all fell off in the second half of the decade, like having troubles to make the playoffs 5.  Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid    They are only relevant in the second half of the decade"
That is very true.  Winning shampionships requires some stars to align even if you have the necessary amount of talent to win it al.  The talent did carry a certain amount of risk that other rosters capable to win a title didn't carry as high.  On paper that clippers squad looks like it shouldve had a title or two.  One thing I think they were lacking was teamwork and cohesion.  Thats a multiplier that every team needs other than teams with Lebron James.

I kinda like this list. It's the top 10 in VORP for the playoffs from 2009-10 to 2018-19 combined.  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Stephen Curry  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. James Harden  6. Draymond Green  7. Chris Paul  8. Dwyane Wade  9. Russell Westbrook  10. Al Horford  Now I'd take off Draymond and Horford and replace them with Lowry and Dame I think and then shuffle it a bit. Maybe something like.  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Stephen Curry  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. James Harden  6. Chris Paul  7. Russell Westbrook  8. Dame Lillard  9. Dwyane Wade  10. Kyle Lowry
James Jones is Lebron's favourite teammate. It's not a coincidence he's been on every team Lebron has been on since Miami.
"Those Pistons teams, top defense. Ben Wallace, Rasheed, Prince... Crazy.   Magic's Dwight 3xDPOY era  Noah DPOY era Bulls was an elite defensive team  The Paul George Pacers, Vogel as a coach. Lance, George Hill, David West. And a player people call an scrub but was the best rim protector during a 2/3 years in Roy Hibbert.  The Hawks 60 win team, was top 5 defense. Demarre Carroll, Al Horford, Millsap, Sefolosha, Teague, Schroder off the bench...  The 2015 Raptors... They were top 3 defense on the league  2008 Celtics, 2nd best defense. LeBron lose that series. Against the big 4,by himself, took them to a 7 games. 2nd best player on that team on the playoffs, was DeLonte West with 10 points per game. 3rd best was Ilgauskas 13/7. 4th best was Wally Szcerbiak 10/1/1  Against prime Pierce, Garnett and Allen, Rondo, Sam Cassell, James Posey, Perkins, Tony Fucking defensive bull dog Allen...   And LeBron gave them a 7 game series with Boobie Gibson, DeLonte West, Ilgauskas and no knees Szcerbiak"

"It is, Larry Bird is a piece of poop compared to uber-freak athlete LeBron James.   Someone with Larry Birds genetics would never survive in today’s ultra athletic and competitive game.  Look at his back it gave out doing chores, while LeBron’s didn’t after carrying Jordan Clarkson and freaking Jeff Green to the finals."
That’s insulting to LeBron James.
Blake Griffin and LeBron James by JJ Barea
"Kemba Walker and LeBron James, but that was probably just Bron going off against the Hornets"
"Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Steve Nash, Lebron James."
I can take or leave Lebron but lebron James was the best player in both those series.
"  &gt; in mind that Kareem went out in game 5 and they started Johnson at CENTER in game 6   This is always posted but it's not accurate. Yes, he technically did the jump ball, but Jim Chones played center that game. Not that it really matters but it's a pet peeve.   Anyway, I know he was unbelievable. But he wasn't a better player than LeBron. LeBron in the same circumstances would do better than Magic did. Sure, by the time LeBron's done he'll still be a ring or two short of Magic, but we're not ranking teams here, we're ranking individuals. LeBron was just straight up better which is why it's so bizarre to have him ranked below Magic. Maybe if LeBron had had Kareem and James Worthy on his cav teams he wouldn't have lost to the spurs and golden state all the time. It's like saying Scottie Pippen was better than LeBron."
Put LeBron James in the 72 win Bulls and they might win the title against the 17' Warriors  Just like Jordan might as well.  I'm telling you to put Jordan in that god-awful Cavs team and see if he does much better  I don't think so
"Folks just didn't watch back then to understand how AWFUL that Lakers team was.  Kobe averaged 35-5-4, was First team All-Defense and had by far the worst supporting cast of any of the MVP candidates. LeBron didn't make any All-Defense team nor did Nash, yet Nash was the MVP.  Kobe was so far ahead of the rest of the league at this time that it wasn't even funny, it wasn't up until later that LeBron started to catch up to him and EVERYBODY (including LeBron James btw, look it up) knew that.  There are people in this sub that actually believes LeBron was the best in the league in 2007 when even himself didn't believe that in an interview he did after the 2008 Olympics."
Imma save some time and take Lebron James level everything
Are we still talking about LeBron James here? The way you're adding details it may as well be someone completely different.
"Yes, Trae Young has been a more efficient scorer than Lebron James this season. He's not a better player. He has not been a better playmaker, he's a negative on defense whereas James has been a positive, but in terms of individual scoring, he has been more efficient by the numbers. Some of those numbers are probably skewed due to the uncompetitive nature of some Hawks games, but [here are their numbers per 100 posessions] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;type=per_poss&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;year_min=2020&amp;year_max=2020&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=ast&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=550&amp;order_by=ws&amp;order_by_asc=Y)."
"I think the biggest British player is OG Anunoby who is like the 3rd best guy for the Toronto Raptors, plus they're the only international team if either of those matter, and they're the defending champions.    I'd say the most popular players (much more a star driven sport than other team sports) in terms of playstyle are Steph Curry (Golden State Warriors) and Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant (both Brooklyn Nets), all were injured this season so neither team is particularly impressive but next season they should both be better.  Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee), James Harden (Houston), and LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers) are the three best players, Giannis is the most athletically gifted player in the NBA, James Harden is the best scorer, and LeBron is a very well-rounded player with the legacy of being the best player in the NBA for basically a decade.  Luke Doncic for the Dallas Mavericks looks to be like he'll be the best player in the world in a few years and he's only 20, so you might enjoy watching his rise over the next few years.  Zion Williamson for New Orleans Pelicans is the #1 rookie last season and he mostly missed this season, but in the 19 games he did look to play, he is a very unique exciting player that looks to be one of the most unstoppable scorers close to the basket and is still a teenager.  Orlando is a pretty defensive minded team, so their playstyle isn't probably the most exciting thing to watch, they're a small market so no one will talk about them, and they don't have any particularly exciting stars, so even their players don't get much discussion.   I personally just enjoy the NBA as a league than rooting for specific teams.  About half the league I root for and half I don't, but I just watch whatever games are on usually instead of trying to schedule my life around just watching the Cavaliers or someone play."
Have a career like LeBron James or Magic Johnson.
"2018-19 Lakers: LeBron James, Tyson Chandler, Rajon Rondo, Michael Beasley, Javale McGee, Lance Stephenson, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram"
"What kind of odd do you think you could have got 2 months ago, on LaMelo Ball owning a basketball team before LeBron James?"
"&gt; Getting to the line and hitting your free throws will make you a more efficient scorer, and threes are worth more than twos so shooting more of them while hitting them at a good rate will make you a more efficient scorer.  Is Trae a more efficient scorer than LeBron James then? because he has a higher TS%. TS% is a stat that is skewed towards players that get to the line more and shoot a billion three's and doesn't actually show who is truly efficient and who is not because being efficient has more to do than just jack up a bunch of three's and have a cool shiny number.  Steve Nash and Jason Kidd both played on some horrible teams, neither did average 4.8 turnovers per game during a season, Trae only gets away with his horrible defense and 5 turnovers a game because he is in Atlanta and nobody cares about a team that will win 20 games."
LeBron James is a lock for HOF
"If Lebron James buys the Cavaliers, theoretically he can sign Bronny to the minimum and write him more and more into the will depending on career achievements."
Seriously who does the guy think he is Lebron James?
I wish i had something as comprehensive for a reply. The only nitpick i can give is that cutting is not only about scoring but also making a play. Lebron might be a better finisher (which is up to discussion for me *in this particular set up*) but Wade was crazy dangerous making a play with the man in the zone. It's been his thing for a big chunk of his career even before Shaq. Just as James has a natural thing for driving and kicking Wade always found a big enough body down there.   Tangentially it's why his assists were relatively low for how much plays he created. A lot of his passes ended up with a player at the line
"I agree with this and have Wade as a more frequent cutter than LeBron. It's why I mentioned him in the top 10 cutters of all time, and hes probably in the top 5.  But I dont think he was better than James. James cut a bit less than Wade because James was the better passer and had the ball more and attracted more defensive attention. But I've felt, and still feel while watching tape of both that team and the Cleveland teams, that LeBron was a bit better for a few reasons.   1. He picked angles better than anyone I've seen.  2. He understood how the threat of his cutting worked spacing wise and occassionally took high or low routes in order to bend defenses for kick out threes, I.e. he would impact the offense without being involved in a single scripted action.  3. He had more gravity on his cuts because if the defense was lucky enough to see it coming, they aremt able to bump him off his route with a high guard, but depended on a big wing or 4 to block him out, which is tough because he was so often coming from the weakside off of someone else's dribble penetration so at minimum one big is already busy protecting the rim.  4. As strong, athletic, and good at finishing Wade was, and thats like an all time great in each of those categories, LeBron was bigger, faster stronger, and could finish better with either hand at the rim.  When he caught the ball moving towards the hoop, he was near undtoppable when he had momentum and you were adjusting. Wades the same way but LeBron has the edge.  5.  While Wade has become an underrated passer on this sub, LeBron ability to have a stronger passing option out of the catch gives him another edge. Whether it was a one touch secondary alley oop, a catch middle and quick slip pass, or a catch and immediate kickout, he could bend the D in and create even more open threes than Wade.  Wade gets underratted here. At the skills I just mentioned, he could do all of them and was an absolutely terrifying off ball cutter. But LeBron edges him out in ability in my opinion even if Wade had the slight edge with frequency."
Lebron James has stiffed many of my service industry friends on large tabs. No one should support him as a player. He is a shit tipper.
"James, Lebron"
"LeBron James is insane with the game   Man I'm talking bout the way he plays with me at night yea we gay  Hey hey hey, what surprise, we both do it right there ain't no shame"
"Curry was not better in 3 out of the four games. Please end this narrative.   Kevin Durant was statistically more impressive, while also guarding LeBron James.   Stop."
Lebron's **Assist to Turnover** ratio is higher in his 30's than in his 20's.    [Source](http://insider.espn.com/nba/player/hollinger/_/id/1966/lebron-james)
"He peaked from 2009 to 2013. that was the period he achieved 1st team all-Defense 5 years in a row, and for good reason.  people like to separate his miami years as if he was a completely different player there but truth is his defensive intensity and ability  was already humming at close to DPOY levels in his last two seasons in Cleveland .  2014 (his last Miami year) was the first year his defensive motor and activity started to wane, leading into his 2nd cleveland stint .

LeBron James is the GOAT
"Lebron didn't really have the insane footwork that Kobe did, which is pivotal in 1v1s. LBJ's first step was also not as fast, and although Lebron's top speed is probably higher, that's less important in half court 1v1s. Kobe's entire game was based on 1v1 skills, I honestly think he'd beat James or at minimum stand a good chance.  KD is tough to answer because he's so freakishly long."
Also Jason Kidd vs LeBron James
"Embiid with a pg who can shoot   not sure which one, but would one of Sabonis or Turner moving to another team, probably Turner tho.. and in my mind him in new orleans would be pretty good   Aaron Gordon on a team where there's legit leaders who tell him bro.. you're not lebron james plz relax..   Lavine not cause his situation is that terrible, they dealt with a lot of injuries this year, but just a more winning organization so he can get the empty stats label off of him   CJ for sure, i feel like with Dame there he kinda gets relegated to just the off ball secondary ball handler guy, i think he's a really good passer and i'd love to see him on a team where he's not the best player.. but the main ball handler atleast"
"&gt;He's also going to get a huge boost when he retires and all the ""GOAT"" stories start to come out  I was responding to a point you made in your original reply. I'm not saying there won't be stories of greatness......it's LeBron James. We also don't know what he will accomplish from now until the end of his career.  Everybody in or around the NBA during MJ's era had a Michael Jordan story because he was near universally accepted as undisputed GOAT. LeBron, as shown by the poll, isn't there yet."

"He's a marketing director and considered the face of 2K. There's a handful of reasons why 2K players hate him, lack of transparency, is one I keep hearing the most. For me though, it's probably how he acts around NBA players, he has the power to manipulate video game numbers, so he thinks that NBA players should suck his dick or something for a great rating. One such example was a tweet regarding Nikola Jokic, saying that he should get a Twitter account if he wanted to be a 90 OVR, not the fact that he's one of the best passing big men in the league.  Edit: the Nikola Jokic one was made by the actual 2K account, but reads like a Ronnie tweet. Also another reason, the amount of self-fellatio he puts in 2K, ""Wow, Ronnie2K noticed me guys, fuck LeBron James sucking my dick, I just met Ronnie2K""."

"bird was huge back in his era, he outweighed the average starting center by 7lbs  in today's NBA he's as big as lebron was at 17 in HS  a lot of these old stars had a massive size advantage that wouldn't apply to today's NBA. i think you folks forget just how fucking big a guy like lebron is who is a lean 6'9"" 250lbs. guys like that didn't exist back then. most guys were much skinnier on average and longer but it wasn't the effective length we have now. MJ had that same advantage, great length, elite size, but he's 20lbs ligher than JR smith nowadays  bird's style of play was bully ball, that's what he wanted to do to you, shove you around and bully you  plop him down in today's NBA and he's kevin love 2.0 without the bitchboy attitude  he'd still be good but when you start giving bird the obvious advantages of modern science, he's not larry bird anymore, he's something else  you can't really compare across eras. all you can do is compare within each era in relation to other greats in their eras  larry bird in his era wasn't as good as lebron james in his era, so there is literally NO REASON to assume he'd be on lebron's level  plop lebron down in that era and he's the biggest/fastest/strongest/most athletic guy in the NBA and probably puts up wilt numbers"
"Sure but I think a player who can control a game on defense is almost as valuable as a player that can control a game on offense. Draymond to me is like the Lebron James of defense, he can completey take over a game on that end alone.   Fans in general don’t really know what they’re talking about, I know that sounds kind of harsh but it’s true. In real time your not gonna notice all of the nuances that contribute to a win, especially on the defensive end. Even great film analysts have to go back and watch the footage to see what actually went down in order to have an informed opinion, most fans don’t do that and as a result they’re only gonna be able to process one thing consistently through out the course of the game which is “did the ball go through the hoop?” As a result there’s so many people who dismiss things like the gravity of Steph Curry or the passing of Draymond because those arent necessarily things that will fit in a highlight reel. You can’t have a free Dawkins video dedicated to Goberts screens right?"
If Lebron James doesn’t have 6mil+ in liquid assets/cash something is wrong. That’s like a 1/10th or less of his career earning. It’s bad finance to have everything invested/tied up.
"""Lebron James doesn't care about coronavirus"" is a monumentally stupid take."
"Of course his basketball IQ was higher in the second 3-peat, but he also simply couldn't do things athletically in the 2nd one that he could do in the first one, it would be like picking 2018 LeBron James over 2013 LeBron James.  You don't have to believe me, just look at the stats, MJ in the first three peat averaged 34-6-7 on 57% TS in the three playoff runs, on the other hand, MJ on the second three peat averaged 31-6-4 on 54% TS in the playoffs.  That's not to mention how much better as a defender he was in the first three peat and how much worse the Bulls as a team was in the first three peat as well.  Don't get me wrong, he still was the best in the league BY A MILE, but in the first three peat he was clearly the best player to ever play the game."
"This is the inside story of how Warriors forward Draymond Green is the player to lead the Warriors to a dynasty -- or the man who could stand in their way.  Editor's note: This story on Draymond Green was originally published on Oct. 19, 2016 and contains explicit language. Watch Game 5 of the 2016 NBA Finals on Wednesday at 7 p.m. ET on ESPN.  ALL IN ALL, it was not the best few months for Draymond Green. On June 10, during Game 4 of the NBA Finals against the Cavaliers, some 20 million viewers caught him in the act of trying to slap LeBron James in the groin. Three days later, after being suspended for that act, he watched his Warriors lose by 15 before dropping Games 6 and 7 in the greatest collapse in Finals history. In early July, he was arrested in East Lansing, Michigan, on an assault charge resulting from a scuffle in a college bar. Later that month, Green accidentally sent out a photo of his penis to the world.  By universal decree, the 2016-17 Warriors are a juggernaut. And if this juggernaut has a foundation, Green is it. Steph Curry is the reigning MVP; new acquisition Kevin Durant is one of the NBA's greatest scorers. But multiple Warriors staffers share the opinion that Green is their most important player. Nobody replicates his set of contributions. As one team official puts it: ""The guys might be frustrated by his antics, but they had an opportunity to prove themselves without him in Game 5 and they played like a bunch of [cowards].""  Herein lies the paradox of the perfectly constructed squad: It's built on ground that roils with lava -- and on the back of a man who has become increasingly unpredictable, emboldened and unaccountable. Draymond Green had a very bad summer. But that weekslong meltdown was a year in the making. And to understand the tensions that could undermine this season's presumptive champion, you must first understand the untold story of what undid the Warriors a season ago.  IT'S JUNE 19, 2015, three days after the Warriors have claimed their first title in 40 years, and Oakland's victory parade has become quite the joyful Draymond Green showcase. More than a million fans lining the parade route have been treated to Green on the mic, slurring in E-40-style syntax: ""Cavaliers. Nope. We won? Yup. They suck? Yup."" And as that parade reaches the rally beside Oakland's Lake Merritt park, they are also treated to a glimpse of the often tense relationship between Green and his coach, Steve Kerr. When it's his turn to address the crowd, Green, victory cap slightly askew, shambles across the podium, snatches the mic and declares that he's excited to be speaking. Golden State PR maestro Raymond Ridder, Green explains, ""tried not to let me talk today. He know I'm gonna get controversial.""  And then he proceeds to validate most all of Ridder's fears: ""With these guys, everything's fun. The only time it's not fun is practice ... film ... games ... bus rides. I'm the only person that gets talked about what shots I take and all those things by Steve Kerr. Like, every time I take a shot, he complains. So that's why, if you see, every time I make a shot, I look at him. Dude complain every time I take a shot.""  From his seat on the stage behind Green, Kerr shrugs and loudly counters: ""Twenty-four percent!"" Which just happens to be Green's 3-point shooting percentage during the final three rounds of the playoffs. Green chuckles, bounds over, grabs Kerr from his chair and drags him to the podium. There are hypothetically a few drops of tension to be wrung from this moment. ""This my guy,"" Draymond starts, prompting Kerr to pat his chest. ""From the start of training camp, he hated me. That's no lie. He probably still hates me. That's no lie. But we going to keep winning these championships -- and that's no lie.""  Kerr, who's been gamely laughing at the display, steals the mic. ""You know how they start to play music at the Oscars when it starts to go on a little long and security comes and grabs the guy? That may happen here in a few minutes. Thanks, though, Draymond,"" he finally offers, before fleeing for the safety of his seat.  EVERYTHING IS GOOD in a victory parade. But before Green's arrival in 2012, the Warriors were a byword for bad. They had made the playoffs only once in the prior 18 seasons. In 2011-12, the lockout-shortened season, they'd won a dismal 23 games, losing 17 of their final 20 to land the seventh pick in the draft. With it, they were hoping to find a savior. Instead, they took Harrison Barnes. The real savior arrived at pick 35. Green, who declined to comment for this story, was underestimated coming into college at Michigan State and then into the NBA -- famously so. The reasons are myriad, but perhaps the main one is this: His approach represents a hybrid, if not a revolution. It's an aggressive, American brashness mixed with an egalitarian, European insistence on moving the ball. Intuition tells us the greats score in bunches, creating their own shot at will. Green does everything save for creating his own shot. It's no coincidence he holds the record for plus-minus in a season. To hear Green yell, mid-drive to the basket, ""Hey! Steph!"" while directing his superstar toward an open space in the corner is to watch a player who not only sees the open man but who speaks his teammates into openness. ""He sees the game,"" says Warriors assistant and defensive guru Ron Adams.  There is another ineffable quality to the man: He just wants it more. It's an energy that overwhelms, fueled by what Kerr calls ""that competitive fire, that rage."" Or, as former teammate Leandro Barbosa once defined Green's optimal basketball mode: ""the guy that always gets mad, the guy everybody hates."" Indeed, his playing style is a constant assault. Every movement is efficient and vicious. He will come to your arena and play the villain, curse out your team, preen after every 3-pointer, light into the refs and possibly kick a foe where the sun doesn't shine.  Kerr once quipped of his team's appeal, ""We have a very likable group of guys -- other than Draymond."" The comment was said with a smile, meant with mirth. A lot of truth is said in jest, as the saying goes. IT'S NOV. 27 in Phoenix, the 17th game of the Warriors' 2015-16 season, and there's nothing not to like about their performance so far. Over the summer, Kerr had predicted that the coming season would be their leap, that magical moment when last year's principles became reflexive. It happened, just not on Kerr's watch. The Warriors are undefeated, and their pattern is getting repetitive: Blow out the opponent, keep starters fresh with rest, keep bench guys happy with plenty of garbage-time run.  Up 25 with 4:14 left, this night is no different -- until Green fouls a driving Archie Goodwin. The action halts. Green helps Goodwin up from his fall as longtime NBA vet Jason Thompson saunters off the bench to check in for Green. The game, of course, is well beyond over, but Green pleads to stay in, shaking his head, holding his hand out in a ""wait"" signal before trudging to the end of the bench in a huff. Within a few seconds, an animated discussion ensues between him and interim coach Luke Walton. Green appears none too pleased. The reason: He is one rebound away from a triple-double.  After 25 seconds of game clock have elapsed, Green is back in front of the scorer's table, arms akimbo, ready to check in. He subs in at the timeout, and 52 seconds later, little-used guard Ian Clark misses a layup, which Green rebounds and lays in. On the very next possession, Green intentionally fouls Suns guard Devin Booker and lopes back to the bench, his mission complete.  A Warriors staffer would later say of the incident, ""Luke would have left him in had he known."" More to the point, as the interim coach, Walton already has enough on his plate without having to worry about aggravating his power forward. Indulging Green may have seemed the only realistic choice.  ""Luke's my guy,"" Green would frequently say of his interim coach, even before Walton took the reins. The two were often seen laughing together during pushup challenges after practice. Both had charisma, but in different ways. Green was the loud life of the party; Walton operated at a languid pace that belied his quick wit.  When Walton took over for the first three months of the season, with Kerr sidelined due to complications from back surgery, he had assumed a light grip on the steering wheel. He was, for example, still rebounding for Green, just as he'd done as an assistant. Though the team had something of a power vacuum in Kerr's absence, Walton thought it best if he maintained his old duties, carrying on as though nothing were amiss. The early results were historically good. The Warriors were dominating the league, dominating SportsCenter, Curry's incandescent start prompting teams to double-team him, allowing Green to make more plays than ever. Sixteen games into the season, Green had gone from averaging 3.7 assists a game the season before to 6.6, and a man who had tallied just two triple-doubles in his first three seasons was now a nightly triple-double threat. And nobody, apparently, was more aware of it than Green, who would end the regular season with 13 triple-doubles, the NBA's single-season record for power forwards. Suddenly far more than a ""glue guy,"" Green was a star, flourishing without restrictions. But such conditions and such outcomes? They make it hard to tell a man anything."
"Draymond Green can do everything at an elite level, no defender in nba history has displayed this kind of versatility on defense. Now back in the day guys weren’t really asked to defend on the perimeter so we can’t say they couldn’t do it but at this stage we can only evaluate what we have seen.   Also awards don’t mean jack, Kawhi doesn’t have any MVPs while Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo do. In no universe are those guys better players, they get the MVP because it’s a narrative based award.  The same goes for DPOY, does it really make sense for Rudy Gobert to have two DPOY awards when we know there are better defenders in the league? Is a guy who can’t stay on the floor vs small ball line ups with lots of shooting(Rockets/warriors) really the DPOY? No this to is a narrative based award.    This would be like arguing that Kobe was better than Lebron because he has more rings"

"He’s one of the most polarizing Athletes in the History of Sports. He is as big of a Celebrity on the court then he is off of it. Theres probably not a single person on this Planet who doesn’t know who LeBron James is. People who don’t even watch Basketball know who he is. Hell, people who don’t even like sports know who he is. The World has been watching him since he was like 15-16 years old. There’s very few Athletes who had the amount of hype he had surrounding him when he entered the League. And there’s a lot fewer Athletes who have lived up to that hype. Let alone surpassed it.  Say what you want about LeBron James as a Basketball Player. You can criticize and critiqued is game all you want. But no one can say LeBron James isn’t one of the most Iconic Athletes of All-Time, in any sport. So of course most of the Posts and Highlights are about him."
A fight to the death- Lebron James vs Tom Gullick holding a samurai sword. Who wins?
"&gt;How is putting your body on the line in front of 200 pound freight trains while staying completely still wack?  Frankly, if you can't see how wack that sounds from your own description we probably won't see eye to eye on this lol. I don't necessarily think it's pussy shit, it's just stupid to me like when a ball handler runs into the defender and throws the ball in the air to get a whistle. Doesn't matter how ""hard"" it is, it's lame because we all know they aren't trying to play ball in that moment, they're trying to exploit the rule book.  It also legitimately kills great basketball moments imo, cause what could have been an amazing defensive play/stop, tough finish or offensive showcase is now just another play added to the rule 4 subsection B highlight reel. Every time a player decides to play for the whistle (or a ref blows a whistle unnecessarily) we trade great basketball moments for ""technical"" victories.   You know what I respect more than Lowry forgoing defense to pretend to be an inanimate object in front of a train? IT trying to contest Lebron James at the rim and failing in spectacular fashion."
"Lebron James averaged 35.8, 13.3 RPG and 8.8 APG in 2015.  Shaq averaged 38 PPG, 16.7 RPG, and 2.7 BPG with 61% shooting (include a pristine 38.7% from the line).  I think Jordan was the GOAT, but there's more to it than pulling out gaudy Finals stats."

"OKC ownership decides against being cheap fucks and keep James Harden. The Thunder go on to win at least one championship and become the bane of LeBron James’ existence. The super team Warriors never form but challenge OKC with their Curry/Thompson/Green core that won 67 and 73 games in back-to-back seasons. They exchange victories and defeats for almost a decade and their rivalry develops into one of the most legendary in NBA history.   Depending on how things go, LeBron James could be denied his third championship altogether, which has major legacy implications for him. Durant, Westbrook, Harden, and Curry could all be seen in a totally different light."

"Honestly with Jimmer’s range, I thought he could easily be top notch role player on a team with Lebron James"
Yeah and if that player is lebron james then you have to postpone the entire playoffs or risk a cover up and hide the test
"Imagine the knockout complications either guy could pull off. Like just imagine stepping into a cage ready to fight fucking LeBron James, like its laughable how much either of them would demolish guys."
"Also because half those teams Jordan faced in the finals wouldn't make the playoffs today.

Magic would retire after this year.  92 Blazers-  1 Star Drexler  93 Suns-  No defense suns, MVP chuck and Kevin (lol) Johnson, but then the corpses of Tom Chambers and Dan Marjerle  95 magic-  loses to a team that got swept by 6 seed rockets  96 sonics-  Gary Payton (calf injury) and Shawn Kemp outplayed Jordan, 30% shooting in last 3 games with Payton as primary defender.  97 and 98 jazz-  washed hornacek, stockton, antoinee carr starting at center, bryon russell lmao. basically shit version of lob city clippers  Beating plumbers and grocery store baggers like John starks isnt that impressive in the watered down expansion era. I love jordan but honestly there wouldn't be a jordan era if Lebron played in the late 80s and 90s"
"That isn't true, unfortunately. Not by any objective measure, at least. But looking at your post history, I don't think you are really trying to maintain any sort of objectivity in your quest to anoint LeBron James as the GOAT."
"2016? Warriors were great but they were legit lucky to beat the Thunder. Team was beatable.   Great win for sure but not some miraculous feat. We're talking about lebron james and kyrie and Klove, right?"
Not ranking LeBron James in the top five is sheer ignorance. It’s totally indefensible.
"Lebron quickly walked back the comments bc as a players association exec (I think he was) the idea of reducing the number of players is absolute sacrilege.   https://www.espn.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/news/story?id=5952952  &gt; ""Hopefully the league can figure out one way where it can go back to the '80s where you had three or four All-Stars, three or four superstars, three or four Hall of Famers on the same team,"" James said. ""The league was great. It wasn't as watered down as it is [now].""  &gt; In fact, James seemed to have a couple of ideas of which teams could go and some players who would make other teams better right now.  &gt; ""[Contraction] is not my job; I'm a player but that is why it, the league, was so great,"" James said.  &gt; ""Imagine if you could take Kevin Love off Minnesota and add him to another team and you shrink the [league]. Looking at some of the teams that aren't that great, you take Brook Lopez or you take Devin Harris off these teams that aren't that good right now and you add him to a team that could be really good. Not saying let's take New Jersey and let's take Minnesota out of the league. But hey, you guys are not stupid, I'm not stupid, it would be great for the league."""

"When he went to the heat, they basically had a parade and did a bunch of really cringy press events. Lebron said they were gonna win 8 finals in a row. At the time, people probably believed this because wade was at his prime 2008-2011. Having 2 top 5 players plus bosh looked like a crazy super team to people. Also they were taking pay cuts if I remember right.   It looked like they were gonna be the KD warriors of their time and just ruin the league. When they lost the finals to a lone star in dirk, it was an extremely humiliating event, especially considering Lebron James had his melt down game with 8 points.   It was seriously just so cringy to be so arrogant and then lose your first finals to an awkward lanky German guy. Jk dirks a legend.   But yeah, then people don’t like Lebron because of the China thing, which was super socially unaware by Lebron. In general, he’s very socially unaware. He ends up saying stupid shit a lot but not cause he’s a terrible person imo, he just doesn’t understand.   Case in point, the Miami thing. Everyone’s already a little mad because you formed a super team in Miami. How are you gonna be holding basically celebration tours as if you’ve already won and telling people you’re gonna win 8 straight? That just makes you look like a huge douche.    All that said, I have him 2nd all time and don’t have a problem with him, but I understand why people do"

"Harder opponents is just silly, the league is more talented on the whole now than it ever had been in history.  1v1 Wilt would probably win, especially if they play make it take it, size is a huge advantage when playing 1V1. If LeBron starts with ball he could take it though.  On a team, LeBron James. He’s at worst the second best player of all time, and on top of being better as a player he’s a better teammate. There’s a reason Wilt lost to Bill over and over, he didn’t play a team game."
Lebron James has no advantage over Wilt Chamberlain. I would really love to hear how you can justify this idea.
Imagine being 20 years old and LeBron james bumps into you while beating his chest.   I'd probably shit my pants.

"&gt;Then he played 42 games in game 5 haha, why did you leave that part out? It’s about rotations too, not just the mins played.   lol not out of negligence and fact skewing, but because it wasn't relevant to the point i was making  &gt; Why do you think he won it? Genuine question  same reason we both said he won it, narrative. Are you arguing that Iggy was more valuable to the 2015 warriors than Curry was?  &gt;Wait vs Raptors? Lol no he wasn’t. It’s very rare to lose and be in talks for finals mvp, that’s how good Lebron was to even get votes. You have to be vastly superior than everyone else and Curry definitely wasn’t in that series. Lebron had the most points, rebounds and assists for both teams in that series, that’s a rare feat and he did it twice. He also isn’t a sieve on defense like Curry  Bron also averaged 4 TO's a game and shot sub 40% for the series. Sure, of course hes gonna put up great counting stats bc there were no other all stars, but his efficiency and playmaking dropped significantly. If the most valuable player was the one who had the best box score, but shitty effiency and TO count and loses anyway, then it's easily Russell Westbrook.   True Bron was the better defender, but Steph was the most valuable player in the Raptor series hands down. The best playoff defensive team had to run a high school defense on the guy, a defense that not even Kobe Bryant, KD, or Bron James himself have even gotten. And he *still* got his. Wayyyy more valuable to the Warriors than Kawhi was to the Raptors. And you can say ""ohhh but Kawhi's defense"", but the Raptors are a better defensive team w/o Kawhi this year than they were last year without him  If you're saying Bron deserved it in 2015, then you have to say Steph deserved it in 2019.  &gt;In the other years like 17 and 18 I don’t think anyone even considered him for it, KD was the easy choice  2017 yes, but in 2018 the vote was split. And I strongly disagreed w the results. The Cavs themselves said their gameplan was to double and trap steph all series... meanwhile, KD got George Hlil on the block *whenever he wanted*. So of course if you're just going by box score, then you're going to think KD was the more valuable player.  But was KD more important than Curry in that series? Hell no. Even the Cavs themselves didn't think so.  &gt;It’s funny you’re so sure I’m wrong and using a weird criteria but I’m going off who *actually* won, so obviously it’s not just me who thinks this, it was the people who actually decide the winner too.  because the media's always right. Congrats, there are plenty of ESPN pundits who think you're right too.  &gt;Saying “but but Curry got 30 points on great efficiency!” Cmon dude there’s not a conspiracy against the first ever unanimous mvp  lol you keep bringing up ""conspiracy"" then attacking me for that point you brought up. I don't think the institutions are designed to put Steph down, i think the systems of voting are flawed and aren't actually based on *who was the more valuable player*. You keep attacking me for all these other points that you're making than I'm not. If you're gonna attack anything, attack my thesis: the systems of voting are flawed and aren't actually based on *who was the more valuable player*"
"well, I was but a wee lad back then, just barely potty trained and pooping on my own in my own toilet for the first time although I still had to get someone to wipe for me when I was done. But I clearly remember watching a beast of a man, Lebron James passing to another beast of a man, Yoonie Brow. A thunderous dunk and my whole family going wild. They said the Lakers would get their first championship since the Kobe days, whatever that means. Then, it all ended. My father swore he would never turn the television on again.  Then came the dark times. I would hear my father cackling by himself in his room sometimes like a lunatic. Fast forward to today, and things are better now. I've learned to wipe my own ass some time ago.  But we ran out of toilet paper so I just use water and my hands."
That kid would go on to be Lebron James
"It's only an exploitation if you're Lebron James or Kevin Garnett. For everyone else, it's a 2 way street. The likes of Jeremy Lin, John Stockton, and Scottie Pippen would never have made the NBA without college years. For everyone else, the 99% who doesn't make it, gets a free degree."

"Talking about #1 draft picks and potentially generational players is an edge case IMO.  For Zion, he became a household name in college which may snowball his career earnings from the brand aspect alone. But the overwhelming majority of NBA players will make the most of their money from their salaries, not their brand.  To put it into context there's [16 current players with shoe deals](https://www.axios.com/joel-embiid-signature-shoe-under-armour-7aa01c12-e816-4114-b60a-77b372cbbe6e.html). Of the top 10 most payed current players, [only 2 earn more in endorsements than their salaries](https://www.statista.com/statistics/202939/nba-players-with-the-highest-salaries/) Bron &amp; Curry). That list can be expanded, but the ratio of salary:endorsement earnings drops off significantly. I would argue only the top 10% at most of the NBA has significant brand earnings (which is being generous IMO), which would mean 90% rely on mainly salaries for their income.  So for those majority of players, being a household names before entering the NBA doesn't matter. NBA scouts aren't scouting for brands, they're scouting for talent. A player will be paid based on how good he is, and he certainly has enough scout visibility in the G-league considering it's operated by the NBA.  &amp;#x200B;  If the player is a star, his brand will develop in the NBA anyways. Look at Lebron ""no college"" James, Giannis, and Luka if he stays on that trajectory."

"It seems to me that when discussing Draymond Green, you're completely neglecting both defense (I wonder why) and the fact that Love played terribly in the playoffs. He was garbage at literally the only thing he's good at.    Here are statistics of the top five players in terms of MPG on ""the highest paid team of all time"" in the playoffs. JR fucking Smith averaged the second most MPG:   \- LeBron James: 34.0 PPG/10.0 APG, 62.0% TS  \- Kevin Love: 14.9 PPG, on 51.1% TS  \- JR Smith: 8.7 PPG on 48.6% TS (36.7% from three) for the playoffs, 44.0% TS in the Finals  \- George Hill: 9.2 PPG on 56.7% TS (31.4% from three) for the playoffs, 44.6% TS in the Finals  \- Jeff Green: 7.7 PPG on 52.4% TS (30.0% from three)  So, please explain to me how this team was any good. Half of those dudes listed are fucking awful defenders as well. Kyle Korver shot 41.3% from three for the entire playoffs but 9% (literally 9%) in the Finals.   How was LeBron supposed to have a chance against Curry/Durant/Thompson/Green/Iguodala when he was literally the only Cavalier to average above 2.5 APG, above 19.0 PPG, and greater than 54% TS? Literally the only one. Oh wait, Ante ""5 total minutes"" Zizic shot 100%. I guess he was enough help."
"And when he made them, he made the second round. Losing to the Warriors. A team that went 73-9, and his second best teammate had been injured for months and his other best teammate is just not as good as Russ. Huh.

Paul George hasn't sniffed the second round since 2014. That's 5 years man.  So to score it, AD took a game off a 73-9 team as the best player with no real number 2 option on the floor and PG loses to Donovan Mitchell, Damian Lillard, Lebron James, some of that with Russell Westbrook (the more embarassing ones, at that) and somehow, it's AD who isn't as good?"

"&gt; I’d be curious to see how that compares to the average star. Was he generally dropping off around the same amount as other stars? Or was his gap bigger?   This got me curious as well.   * **Kawhi: ~2% improvement in the playoffs.**    He should be tough to gauge because he was a late bloomer and he's moved teams quite a bit. He has all these extenuating factors that should bounce his numbers around but he shows a consistent improvement in the playoffs.    For his career, he's +2.1% more efficient in the playoffs   If you look at just his San Antonio tenure then his TS% jump from 59.7% to 61.7% (+2%) when going into the playoffs. But he wasn't a scorer for a lot of that time.   If you look at his scoring prime (2015-2019) then his efficiency jumps from 60.9% to 62.8% (+1.9%).    You can debate the best way to evaluate him, he still ends up ~2% more efficient in the playoffs. For reference, that's slightly better than Durant's GSW change (+0.9%).  * **Lebron: ~2% drop in the playoffs**    For Lebron's career, he drops from 59.5% to 57.9% when entering the playoffs (-1.6%). Similar to Kawhi, there are a lot of extenuating circumstances but the numbers come out pretty similar.    During his first Cleveland run, he dropped from 57.6% to 56.1% in the playoffs (-1.5%).   Similar to KD, he saw an efficiency spike when he joined a superteam. Unlike KD, he was still a clear #1 and had a still suffered an efficiency drop.  He went from 62.2% in the regular season to 59.5% in the playoffs (-2.7%).   Back to Cleveland, his numbers drop from 60.2% to 58.0% (-1.8%).     * **Harden: 4.2% drop in the playoffs**   Harden's the easiest to gauge because we have a clear timeframe where he was the #1 option for his team.    In Houston Harden sees a 4.2% drop on average, that's slightly better than the 5.4% drop Durant saw on average in OKC.   OKC Durant's lows are about as low as Harden's (54.2% vs 54.8%), his highs are about as high and as frequent as Harden's (both only had one playoff run &gt;60; 63.2% vs 62.0%).  And that's what I mean when I say he's almost like a different person. In OKC, he was slightly worse than James Harden. In GSW, he was slightly worse than Kawhi. It's as if he enters into a completely different comparison tier.     &gt;his legacy will ultimately depend on how his Tenure in Brooklyn goes. I think his FMVP’s with Golden State will be validated to some degree.  100%.   Durant being able to win as the #1 with Brooklyn the way they are now would be comparable in some ways to Lebron winning in Cleveland.   Obviously the narrative won't be as strong (LBJ coming home and the comeback against the 3-1 Warriors), but in terms of public sentiment, I think you would see a similar backflip.    If he falls short then his inability to win with OKC will always hang over him. We've seen the NBA as an organisation take his two rings at face value, but I don't think fans will ever accept them.   Without a Brooklyn ring, I think fans will start to have a serious Harden vs Durant discussion."

"even in 2011, when we whiffed on LeBron James"
Lebron James would never
"&gt; nothing but feelings  Sorry you're unable to click on links. Here:  https://deadspin.com/just-undo-it-the-lebron-james-profile-that-nike-killed-1602381429  That sure is a lot of feelings.    &gt;i got death threats yesterday over it and that doesn't bother me, i know people like that are spineless little pussies, but i'd appreciate some appropriate effort on your part  Keep on fighting the good fight, you brave warrior! LeBron is sending some basement-aid right now as we speak so you can stay online and defend his good name! Such a noble effort!"
"&gt; how many other folks with these shows get to preface it with some damage control?   His reputation is that of an alcoholic gambler who is also a shitty owner, who happens to be the greatest basketball player of all time.   I assume the player you're a fan of quite literally doesn't even let a fart come within 500 yards of him [without Nike giving it the go-ahead](https://deadspin.com/just-undo-it-the-lebron-james-profile-that-nike-killed-1602381429). Give me a fucking break."
"LeBron is famous for loving his role players. He has notable bromances with Mike Miller, Z Ilgauskas, Tristan Thompson, Kuzma, RJ, Mo Williams, Kyle Korver, the list goes on. How many teammates of James have ever said a cross word about him?   LeBron even successfully lobbied some of those guys into all star games, AND helped get them fucking paid. Most of those guys I listed played the best ball of their lives when playing with Bron, and have nothing but love to say about the guy"
"No he really hadn't, in 2018 LeBron went superhuman and had one of the best playoff runs ever and even in 2019 he averaged 27/8/9 missing the playoffs, while Durant was playing with the 3rd best player of our generation in GS. I'm not taking anything away from KD, he is unbelievable, but at no point in his career was he better than LeBron James."
As a Celtics fan and always get obliterad by Lebron in the playoffs. James is the GOATest then battle for number 2 and so on.
"&gt;the reason we have Oscar so high is because he was the original triple double man.  That's not the reason Oscar is so high. It's a side effect of why Oscar is on the list... Being the GoAT when he played is why he is so high on the list. Heck, [KAJ still thinks he's the GoAT.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1798248-kareem-abdul-jabbar-oscar-robertson-better-than-michael-jordan-and-lebron-james)"
"I don't want to replace Magic because he is a big mismatch against almost all point guards. However, if MJ is replaced by Kobe, who is a better shooter and a ball hogger (hence why I didn't add him at first), Lebron James could replace Bird so that there can be a slasher towards the basket while Kobe waits for catch and shoot opportunities when someone gets double teamed."
"This is such a desperate argument and taken completely out of context. LeBron took literally every decent player with him when he left the Cavs for the first time, three of the starting five including Shaq left. Other key players like Big Z left, Mo Williams lasted barely a third of the season before leaving. They were replaced with players that were so bad they didn't even get drafted or got drafted in the second round. It was textbook tanking and it got them three number one picks in the next four years. That team was about as decimated as you could imagine. The better comparison would be to the 98 Bulls who won 62 games, were broken up to a similar degree and who then only won the equivalent of 21 games the next season (it was a shortened lockout season). Wow, what a surprise.....when you take the best players out of a team and replace them with garbage it suddenly does poorly!             Also when Jordan left to play baseball he was basically the only good player to leave, the rest of the core was intact. Then on top of that they drafted a future 6MOY and top 50 *all time* FIBA player in Kukoc and traded for the all time career 3pt percentage leader in Steve Kerr as well as a couple of solid centers. Add to that the fact Pippen had a career year, top three in MVP voting, first team All NBA and you get a damn good team. It's no surprise that when you add Jordan back into the mix as well as Rodman the team suddenly breaks the all time regular season wins record and blitzes their way to the first of three consecutive titles.              And no, LeBron didn't beat a 73 win team. The Cleveland Cavaliers beat them with a lot of help from Kyrie Irving who averaged 30ppg in the three wins they had from being 1-3 down. Of course LeBron played great but he had plenty of help from his point guard. That's not to mention the disparity in quality of play between the regular season GSW team and the team that trotted out for the post season. In 24 games they lost as many as they did in 82 games. Steph was way down from his unanimous MVP regular season self. His contribution across the board was down, his WS/48 were less than half, his BPM went from 12 to 7. He went from 30ppg to 25. He dropped 7% in true shooting. He was nearly 10 points lower on PER. He simply was not the same player. There was the suspension to Green at a crucial point in the Finals, the injury to their rim protector for half the series and the disappearing act of Barnes whose TS% dropped by 10 percent and who couldn't hit the side of a, wait for it......Barne! There was very little resemblance to the team the Cavs faced in those Finals and the one that destroyed the league in the regular season.              Oh yeah, GS added an All Star to their team in order to beat yet another custom built LeBron James superteam. I'm afraid LeBron doesn't get a pass for continually building superteams in his quest to catch Jordan and build his legacy. If GS added a superstar it wasn't to beat LeBron himself, it was to beat LeBron's custom built superteam. To beat a superteam sometimes you need to build an even 'superer' team. Don't put that on GS, put it on LeBron for setting the precedent in Miami."
I mean. Everybody seems to want to have that chat about a guy like Lebron James.......   Not a huge fan of either of the two. But I guess I just get sick of the Michael was perfect shit.   It’s almost as bad as all these stories about Wilt Chamberlain basically being the best in the world at EVERYTHING
"Lol and its not a ""nice player"" its LeBron James ffs. This isn't like you got Jimmy Butler or Gordon Hayward and don't think they're a max you'd rather go to the lottery. There's a good chance **no team** drafts anyone better than LeBron for decades if ever."
LeBron also hasn’t played a playoff series in the Western Conference. Totally different animal. LeBron will have to go against teams like the Houston Rockets in the second round. LeBron never played against a player like James Harden in the Eastern Conference
"As we've seen the past 10 years, NBA coaches aren't exactly the smartest people in the world. The 3-point line existed for decades before the current ""3-point era"", and yet only recently they were able to figure out that the math points towards 3-pointers being much more efficient shots than mid-range jumpers? I don't know if I would trust their judgement if I were you. They seem just as susceptible to mistakes as the rest of us when it comes to basketball, especially since, as I said before, defense is hard to judge, *especially* by just looking at it. Beyond that, we see every year that NBA coaches and front offices are terrible judges of basketball talent: it's called the NBA draft. How many high draft picks end up living up to their potential? Less than half, maybe 25%?   Kobe was a great on-ball defender when he needed to be, but he's nowhere near the off-ball and team defender that LeBron is, which leads to Bron having much better stats in that area. You can take your appeal to authority further, but the numbers just aren't there for you. My argument is, basically, that the basketball world got wooed by his great on-ball defense in big moments, which everyone watched, and conveniently forgot all the substandard defense that he played when the bright lights weren't on. However, we shouldn't judge players only by what they do in the clutch--playing great defense in the 1st quarter is just as important as it is in the 4th, and LeBron was, according to every defensive metric, the more consistent defender **by far**.  Yes, everyone knows that the post-Shaq Lakers sucked. And yes, there was *even less* talent on those teams than on LeBron's Cleveland teams. However, let's consider that the coach of those teams was *Mike Brown*, generally considered a joke of a coach, especially on offense. Despite having a terrible offensive coach, they had the 9th best offense in the league. That's mostly LeBron's work, there. I mean, Larry Hughes shot a hillariously-bad 40.9% from the field for 15ppg (-1.3 BPM that year), and he was the next-highest scorer after LeBron. He also had a 0.1 DBPM, so much for that defensive 2nd team, eh? He was, obviously, much more of a detriment than a help.   Stackhouse averaged 30 on terrible efficiency. He was just chucking up shots. But, that sort of proves my point. A lot of people *can* put up big numbers, but few can do it with efficiency as well. Kobe and LeBron are two who could. For some reason you don't think that LeBron James, freak of nature and GOAT contender, couldn't put up a few more points if he were to just throw caution to the wind, and I can't help that. Think what you want."
Ah. apologies. I was trying to mean in terms of even first place votes. Like the CBS Sports [Article](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2020-nba-award-picks-giannis-antetokounmpo-runs-away-with-mvp-over-lebron-james-experts-split-on-dpoy/).

I was just tryna talk shit but anyone who thinks A.D is leaving the number 1 seed with Lebron James on none other than the Lakers just to go to the Bulls because they fired some personnel isn't thinking realistically.
If Miami Heat Lebron existed in the the current leagues pace he’d be averaging MVP Westbrook level triple doubles with LeBron James level efficiency and defense.
"Probably favorite quote of all time from the NBA:  “I thought LeBron James was just going to be another addition to help me score.” Ricky Davis.  This is the same fool who got an inbound pass and purposely shot at the wrong rim to get a rebound, so he get a triple double in a blowout.  Btw, the rebound didn't count and the Cavs fined him. Davis never got a triple double in his career."
"It’s incredible how even in a worldwide pandemic, hundred thousand deaths, fucked economy, all sports shut down, this sub again makes it all about lebron James"
We’re fuckin spoiled. I can’t wait to tell young bloods that LeBron James III is no where near the player his grandpappy was.
"LeBron James    Kyrie  Irving    Mark Price    Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Was hard to leave out Brad Daugherty, Larry Nance Sr. and Kevin Love."
Dwyane Wade LeBron James Shaq Chris Bosh/Zo are pretty interchangeable for the fourth imo.
"Khris Middleton, LeBron James, Rick Pitino"
"Absolutely fascinating point there. I agree that a team of professionals would beat a team of amateurs.   While we're pumping out red hot takes... I just gotta say this (and sorry if it's controversial to anyone): if LeBron James played against a team of nine year olds he would score, at the very least, 30 points."

"""There is NO LOVE LOST between Paul Pierce and Lebron James. None"".  \-the live call during this play."
No. It has got to be the Cavaliers. I am LITERALLY LeBron James and I can recall people eating poop off my jersey once I went to the Heat.
"Just to play devil's advocate (not saying this is necessarily the case) but if there was one current of former NBA player who'd rather take a shot at his former rivals over cashing in on his own self-praise, it'd probably be Bill Laimbeer.   In this particular interview, his wording and the manner with which he spoke seemed to suggest that his choice between MJ and LeBron had more to do with being amazed by LeBron James than it did faulting Jordan."
This is 19 year old LeBron James in the Olympics so he wouldn’t have gotten normal LeBron minutes. Still a poorly managed team anyway
Chronologically:  * Bill Russell * Wilt Chamberlain * Oscar Robertson * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar * Larry Bird * Magic Johnson * Hakeem Olajuwon * Michael Jordan * Shaquille O'Neal * Kobe Bryant * Tim Duncan * LeBron James  That's pretty much 98% of everyone's Top 12. Hakeem is in there. I don't see how he's really underrated.
"&gt; I'm not quite sure he's a superstar  Superstar is such an empty term, but... Pierce has a pretty rock solid Top 50 all-time player argument.  If that's not a superstar, then the list of superstars in the entire 70 year of history of the NBA is mighty small.    He's not Lebron James or Michael Jordan, but guys like that are superstars amongst the superstars."

"But guys did help. Just like you see people in today's game stay in the key longer than 5 seconds and travel, you just had to disguise it better. But yeah it is much easier to help today.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2779200-the-jordan-rules-vs-the-lebron-rules-stopping-mj-was-totally-different  &gt; Van Gundy, a disciple of the Jordan Rules, has openly questioned in his role as broadcaster the unwillingness of teams to double-team James. From the Pacers in the first round to the Raptors in the second round to the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals and now the Warriors, playing James straight up, switching every pick-and-roll and having everyone else stay home on three-point-point shooters has been the common refrain.  ""The difference would be, Michael was never playing with five out,"" an Eastern Conference head coach told B/R. ""Michael never had Kevin Love at the 5 with a lineup of, say, [Kyle] Korver, JR Smith and [George] Hill, where every guy could shoot threes. To blitz now, particularly in the middle of the floor, is very difficult. It's totally different.  ""If you want to go back to when Michael played, teams like New York and Miami blitzed every pick-and-roll and that was their primary coverage, because everybody was playing three-out, two-in [the paint],"" the coach said. ""With the new spacing, it's not impossible to blitz, but it's very, very difficult.""  Like I said most teams don't even double LeBron. Also considering that LeBron would be using the 3 less his shot within 3 feet would swell from 36% and be much closer to 50%. In Jordans era bigs guarded the paint much more and you seen the bigs help a ton in the paint. So yeah LeBron might get less help in his mid range game but LeBron is below league average in mid range percentages as it is."
Never forget that Bismack Biyombo got paid 70M from blocking LeBron James
"LeBron James, AD and Alex Caruso"
&gt; LeBron James is widely considered the GOAT               I know this is an old post but I just can't help myself.........this comment is blatantly false. He is not even close to being 'widely considered' as the GOAT. A survey of NBA players last season had it 73% vs 11% in Jordan's favour. A public survey not much longer after that had it 65% vs 15% and the recent r/nba survey had it 67% vs 22%. So how did you come to that conclusion again? Complete guess work? Making assumptions based on your own opinion? Please elaborate....
Having LeBron James or Steph Curry is more impactful than having Aaron Rodgers if you ask me.

"NCAA games are also shorter, and they play just two games per week, so they're not having to deal with the grind of an NBA schedule and the fatigue that comes with it. Its easier for them to hustle their ass off playing defense.  Also, the NCAA game has a lot more players who literally bring only athleticism and defense to the table. They aren't good enough to be an offensive threat, but they're quick and can jump, so the coach just has them give everything they can on defense.  So people play a clip of some scrappy guy playing his heart out on defense because he's trying to make the most of the 8 minutes he's going to be in the game, and then compare it to James Harden standing around or LeBron not sprinting full court after a turnover in an attempt to get some meaningless transition block, and think NBA players don't play defense."
"We didn't spend the entire season only trusting in LeBron. But playing LeBron-ffense is what happens when the playmakers on your team are riddled by injuries. James Jones played significant minutes. He was our 7th man in a 7 man rotation. The only two guys on our team who could run an offense at all were Delly and JR Smith. That's not enough to beat the Warriors. There was no other strategy that could have worked, and the Warriors knew that too, so they could focus on making LeBron as ineffective on his takes as possible. That's why he was so inefficient. Despite all that, we still took games 2 and three. I can count on my hands the guys that could have single-handedly taken 2 games off of those Warriors with that supporting cast, and Steph Curry is definitely not one of them. I'm not saying he should have gotten Finals MVP, because in my opinion, if someone on the losing team is going to get it they have to be twice as good as the best player on the winning team. But to say Curry was better than LeBron in that (or any) finals series is just ridiculous"
"Well the Magic also caught from 3 while shutting down all other Cavaliers not named LeBron James. But regardless, LeBron still had moments where he was weirdly passive in that series."
Shawn Marion is by far the greatest defender of all time if he managed to limit LeBron James that much. Everyone knows LeBron just choked lmao.
"He's in his 4th so far.   1st prime was uber athletic wonder kid Cavs LeBron. Not much of a shooter or post player, not as good of a playmaker, but a cyborg who plays 48 mins a game and dominates the game through sheer athleticism. Puts dudes in posters nightly, makes a stupendously athletic play at least once per quarter. Aside from a blip year in 2006-07, he was also a consistent free throw shooter. The 48 Special LeBron who scored 29 of the last 30 points and killed the 00s Pistons. The LeBron who averaged a whopping 38-8-8 in a losing effort against Dwight's Magic in the 09 ECF.   2nd prime was Miami LeBron, still with otherworldly athleticism but combined with maturity, efficiency and smarts molded from years of playoff heartbreaks. Becomes a defensive juggernaut with vastly improved outside shooting and post-play. Develops into a fearsome crunchtime performer, sheds the unclutch reputation by transcending the usual definition of a clutch player who plays hero ball in the last moments of the game. Probably the best prime in terms of stats, efficiency and free throw shooting. Game 6 Boston killer LeBron. Villain masked LeBron and first sighting of headband-less LeBron. Killed the hopes and dreams of PG13 (then PG24) Pacers, Big 3 Celtics, D-Rose Bulls.   3rd prime was LeDad LeBron of the Cavs. Athleticism, defense, efficiency and shooting all drop a little, becomes someone who picks spots. Headband has been shed. LeCoast during regular season in full swing, LeFlipping the Switch becomes a thing. But all of this made up by the fact that he has become the league's most intelligent player, someone who can control the flow of the game offensively and defensively and still have the athletic gifts to make it happen. By this time he has become the league's premier 4th quarter player, in supreme control of anything that happens in the court during crunchtime. Saves up his best performances in the playoffs. Has become ass in the charity stripe, unfortunately. Vintage LeBron free throw: clank the first, hit the second. The LeBron who becomes the first player in history to lead all players in the 5 major statistical categories in a playoff series (doing in in the Finals). ~~2017~~ 2018 Playoffs Legend who dragged the Cleveland LeBrons to the Finals. Dawn of the LeBronto. The Nightmare of the Trash Brothers Raptors and Spurs East Hawks. Triggered the birth of arguably the most stacked team in NBA history.   4th prime is LeBron ""Magic Johnson"" James. Athleticism again drops a bit, more load management and more LeCoast. But has evolved to a playmaking savant, becoming Prime Magic of Showtime 2.0. Still with the chops to dominate a game during crunch time. Once in a blue moon still puts a guy on a poster but more often than not, goes for a simple lay-up or least physically-stressing move. Aside from the centers and big men who don't really shoot outside, perhaps the worst free throw shooter among the legends of the game."
"he lost by 3 votes, out of a total of 11 votes.  Iggy won 7-4, and the results were released right after the series.  I don't get why everyone is getting this wrong in how they remember it, the voting wasn't close.    &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/andre-iguodala-wins-finals-mvp-lebron-james-7-4-vote-total-golden-state-warriors-champs-061615](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/andre-iguodala-wins-finals-mvp-lebron-james-7-4-vote-total-golden-state-warriors-champs-061615)"
Re read my statement please.  They singled him with help through 3 games (when they were 1-2 before Iggy made his surge for MVP consideration)  Then doubled in game 4 and did a mixture of both throughout  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2015/06/13/golden-state-and-the-art-of-double-teaming-lebron-james/  Having guys be able to help off the other 4 was a huge advantage for Iggy. He did a solid job but was not the main reason the Warriors won. We all know Steph was the engine to that offense and his offensive averages were above Kobe's Finals MVP stats.
"It's the 73-9 Warriors, but this criteria will exclude them.  &gt;Since the purpose is to hand out a title to a core group that never won one together, any team that won a championship in a different season of the same era was disqualified.   &gt;   &gt;That means you won’t see any of the following teams, among others:   &gt;   &gt;The 73-win Warriors that famously blew a 3-1 lead.   &gt;   &gt;Any team from LeBron James’ Heat career or second tenure in Cleveland. (There is one pre-Decision Cleveland team that made the field).   &gt;   &gt;Any of Magic Johnson’s Lakers, Larry Bird’s Celtics, Michael Jordan’s Bulls, or Isiah Thomas’ Pistons.   &gt;   &gt;Any Spurs team from 1997-2015.   &gt;   &gt;The 2000s Pistons. Yes, even the teams that fell short after Larry Brown left.  I sort of get why they're doing this but...."
"He is the best combination of Magic and Jordan the game has ever seen. Maybe the only. When healthy he had top 20 all time potential, maybe even higher.  If he was healthy he and Grant Hill would have transitioned the game with unselfish play into the Tim Duncan/LeBron James period."
"This might be hard to understand, but he's still LeBron James - even when he's tired."
This article has stats and play example of the spacing problem that I mentioned. Please take a look https://www.sbnation.com/2013/6/19/4444164/lebron-james-dwyane-wade-heat-spurs-nba-finals-game-6
"Former teammate Eddie House:  “I can’t get over the fact he didn’t show up in Dallas,” House said, [as transcribed by](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/lebron-james-eddie-house-miami-heat-quit-2011-nba-finals-video/)UPROXX. “Not only because I was on the team, but the fact he was the best player and everybody was dependent on him to show up and do what he does, and he was M.I.A. He had a bad series. No, a bad series. Jordan never had that. People killed James Harden for having a bad series last year, right. ‘Oh no, he ain’t as good as he is,’ but you going to say somebody who quit in the Finals, at the end of everything, when all the marbles are on the table, that he’s the greatest of all time? I can’t buy it. I can’t buy it for that reason right there.”"
"LeBron James.      Dude played like absolute ass all series, especially in the fourth quarters where he made zero impact."
"You're incredibly melodramatic, but that's not surprising.  I'm not judging a man, I'm saying that one particular action is stupid. So calm down with that aspect of it.  And yes, I think spending an egregious amount on a car is also stupid, but that at last has  more lasting impact and is easier justified.  The fact of the matter is, things like expensive wines are good, even great, but so much so that you can ever reasonably justify spending such an absurd amount on a single bottle. Sure, you might have enough money that you barely even notice, but that doesn't somehow make it smart.  What you're doing is paying for a name, or in this case, paying so that you can show off to people on Instagram. If that same bottle cost $20, I doubt the scenario plays out the same way.  Back in the day, being a show off was considered trashy and definitely not something to look up to. Now, people call it ""showing out"" and somehow it's acceptable and considered cool.  The same way throwing hundreds of dollars on the floor at a strippers feet is considered cool.    So, maybe I'm just super jealous that I don't have as much money as LeBron James.  Or maybe, I just find those particular actions to be foolish and needlessly vain."
Even those years KD was probably better than him but its a team game and you are only as good as your supporting cast. Just like how many were quick to say 15-16 or 16-17 curry was better than lebron james when it was clearly not true.
"Entering last season, Damon Jones said that Steph has more to prove than James Harden, and went on to say Steph has never lead a team to the playoffs as the only all star (which is false).  Idk what RJ has said though. Probably wasnt as bad as the stuff Maverick Carter, Damon Jones, Dahntay Jones, and other LeBron homies have said"
"&gt; James Harden is someone who gets treated poorly by the media. LeBron...get a grip.  The claim was that Steph gets treated better than Lebron by the media, not that Lebron is treated poorly. Get a griiiippp skiiiiip"
"No he doesn’t. LeBron has like 2 or 3 major media trolls but also an entire host of people in the media who exist solely to defend his legacy. Steph gets plenty of criticism for falling short ever since 2016. Heading into the 2017 finals people said they’d rather have Kyrie over Steph in a finals series without hesitation. Steph averaged 37/7/6 in the WCF last year and people said Dray was the MVP of the series. Stop plugging your ears. In last years finals he had 47/8/7 and lost to the Raptors in game 3, half the talking points and media tweets were people claiming “now he knows how LeBron feels.”  James Harden is someone who gets treated poorly by the media. LeBron...get a grip."
LeBron James? Luka Doncic?
"I like D Rose and don't want to come across as hating on him, but let's be real for a second: if somebody's best demonstration of intelligence is that they're good at a game, is that really *that* impressive? What I mean is, why do we value ""basketball intelligence"" or ""tennis intelligence"" or whatever when, at the end of the day, what really helps people succeed at sports is their athleticism?  When LeBron James runs full court and gets an awesome chase down block, the other players aren't like ""Damn. I wish I had thought to do that."" He has the physical gifts to make the plays.  I'm just saying that I don't like being super negative about people and I'm not going to go around calling Rose stupid, but the fact is that not everybody is really smart. Some people are geniuses. Some people are fucking morons. And there's a lot of people somewhere in the middle. We don't have to justify somebody being smart because they're good at basketball. They can be dumb and be good at basketball too."

"According to PER Hassan Whiteside is as good as Nikola Jokic, and Karl Anthony Towns is better than LeBron James.  PER sucks as a stat.  See how badly I keep destroying you?"
I believe LeBron James was either misinformed or not really educated on the concept of a superteam. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the statement in this interview.
"Are you sure you watch basketball?  Lets name all the amazing passers who average between the 7-8 assist range just this year: Nikola Jokic, Ben Simmons, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook and James Harden. LeBron James for most of his career didn't average over 8 assists per game.  Also, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry both took the ball out of Draymonds hands a lot, and each handled creation duties a lot in case you didn't know.  All the arguments you make are borderline nonsensical. Not once have you used relevant statistics, not once have you vocalized an observation about Draymond's abilities, not once have you explained to me why you think Draymond is a bad passer or is a low IQ player. Just saying ""BuT thE TeCHnIcaL FoULs"" isn't enough. I've provided you evidence of his ability to read the court and anticipate plays before they unfold and you covered your eyes. I've given you resources from a person who's worked for NBA teams and has had years of experience as a statistician and you've just said ""he knows nothing"" without even listening to what he has to say. I've given you advanced statistics and On/Off numbers that you've ignored. I've refuted your claims with reasoning that you've also just elected to ignore. And you continue to just use counting stats as ways to tell whether or not a player is good. Hell you've chosen to go after my phrasing before actually combating some of the points I'm making.  Listen dude I don't know how you think you're winning when your talking points include: Sensationalist bits like those techs, basic box score numbers like points and assists, irrelevant points about how Draymond can't elevate a trash team to mediocre heights, and my phrasing.  Ooh I'm just getting hammered with all these cerebral points you're making. Dude you've lost hours ago, give it up, it's embarrassing to see you claw at almost random arguments that barely even relate to what I'm saying, much less refute it. I mean using technical fouls as a way to try and refute my points about Draymond's feel for the game? Come on man."
"I have less problem with him losing. Making the finals is definitely an accomplishment (though the state of the east during Lebron's finals streak shouldn't be ignored). The way he lost is what I take issue with it. When you're arguing for who's the goat, it's a details game. Lebron James is an amazing, amazing basketball player. He is the best player of the 2000s, and right now, is either 2nd or 3rd best of all time. But MJ never had a finals series performance, or even a playoff series performance like lebron's 2011 finals, and that needs to be discussed when discussing who's the goat."
"Upon hearing LeBron James say that LeBron James is the greatest player to ever live, LeBron James said it was the best compliment he had received up to that point in his career."

"Lebron has shown plenty of desire to make political and social commentary when he knows it won't hurt his earnings.  https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/537079866802589696  Lebron James produced a fucking documentary about social justice and activism in the NBA.

I am trying to start a dialogue and I want to open peoples minds I am speaking from someone that used to believe in a lot of the things I no longer believe i’m not speaking like I’m better than someone else I fell for a lot of the same traps I’m not trying to be better than anyone else the only difference between me and someone else with the beleifs I had is time and I learned.  What I said isn’t like saying JR Smith was the best player on the Cavs in 2016 what I said is more like saying LeBron James was the finals MVP in 2016 It’s a fact that can be looked up and confirmed."
"He wouldn't even have to pay. If he asks Spotify for free premium he gets it, he's LeBron James."

"i dont have an opinion of lebron james and his financials. i just want to say fuck tipping. we should get rid of it entirely. if you work for a place, that place should pay you."

"I saw Lebron James at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
LEBRON JAMES
And then there’s people like you who don’t have brain cells and say things like “it liTeRaLly cost the server money to serve LeBron James.”
how it cost server money to serve lebron james?
"lot of people will say “who cares” or “that’s petty on them to put that out there” but if you’ve never worked in the service industry, you don’t get to have an opinion on poor tipping.   you tip out more than $10 on an $800 tab. it literally cost the server money to serve Lebron James."
"I'm sorry, did I need to list every bad thing the US did in order to highlight how Lebron James ignored the plight of a people who are in concentration camps?"
Bill Hader plays some kind of sports doctor and is good friends with Lebron James. They have lunch together and when the check comes Lebron insists that they should pay their share because it's what friends do. Lebron then pretends that he left his wallet in his car. The whole movie is actually pretty good but that scene is hilarious.
"I don't disagree with you in that AD and Wade are fully capable of being a title contending team's first option, but after 2012, I feel Wade gave LBJ the nod, and played a 1B to James' 1A. AD even more so, in that no one has really questioned who The Man is on that squad. AD gets to live in the sweet spot of everyone knowing he's amazing, but also having all the pressure on LeBron. I'm not criticizing Davis here, he's been a goddamned monster all year, but part of me thinks that he doesn't mind being seen as The Other All NBA player on the Lakers. That lets me think they both didn't mind the sidekick role."

WTF I hate LeBron James and Michael Jordan now???????
Isn't this the game LeBron James it on Duncan?
"looks absolutely more special than what? duncan had 5 rings, so did magic, kareem had 6 rings and 5 more mvps, lebron has 3 rings and 3 more mvps, while accomplishing something in the finals no one has ever done, hakeem had two legendary rings, wilt was wilt. does kobe do anything that stands out from this group? this is why so many people barely have kobe top 10.   And Steve Kerr said KD is better than LeBron James. player opinions aren't always conclusive. not to mention that countless players think lebron james is better than mj. some older players even say kareem or bill russell  or wilt are the best. does any of this mean anything? why dont we actually watch the players for ourselves and construct our opinions that way?  Greatest isnt the same thing as best, either. Kobe was there longer than magic and of course magic's optimistic ass would crown kobe. kareem at his peak was definitely better than kobe,   Look who closed out Indiana? Now you're just making things up. Shaq averaged a whopping 38 points that series. In the fourth quarter of game 6, Shaq dropped 13 points without missing a single shot, whereas Kobe missed almost all of his. Yes, Kobe did score the last 4 free throws but they literally could have won without those free throws. This was the absolute worse example you could bring up considering shaq had a great fourth quarter."
"I don't get the obsession people on this website have with justifying other peoples' wealth.   Most millionaires don't have some extraordinary set of skills or ability that makes them more successful than everyone else, they're just luckier. These guys are lucky that they knew LeBron James. For a lot of millionaires, they're lucky to be born into a wealthy family. It is what it is, but no need to pretend these guys are somehow special."
"Yeah 4 guys don't have 4 times as much, but 5 times as much. Like for instance 4 LeBron James only have 2 times as much are MJ but 4 MJs have 8 times as much as LeBron.  You don't really understand multiplication do you?"

This is because Tim Duncan is a better NBA player than Lebron James.
Tim Duncan was awesome. I believe he’s actually underrated. His career was probably better than Kobe Bryant’s and Lebron James (at least up until this point).

Lol. Yeah I'm sure the knicks approved this trade. They also approved trading Trier for Lebron James but something tells me that won't work either...
Can Lebron James stop Jason Terry?
"Funny enough these quotes turned into a big deal back then because of Jordan’s comments about Lebron not being able to drive to his left.  The reporters asked Lebron about it, and the next game he made a point to score with his left hand   &gt; That reached James' ears and, simply, he doesn't agree. Within days of the story coming out, James won a game by driving to his left and getting to the rim with 3.2 seconds left to beat the Orlando Magic for what then was then the Miami Heat's 16th consecutive victory.  &gt;James did it again Wednesday night, when he drove left as Indiana Pacers guard Paul George seemed to follow the Jordan scouting report to defend James from going right. This time, James got to the rim just ahead of the buzzer to deliver the game-winner with his left hand and put the Heat up 1-0 in the Eastern Conference finals.  &gt;""That theory is wrong, I guess,"" James said of the Jordan report.  https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/9305856/lebron-james-says-michael-jordan-scouting-report-wrong"

"Tony was our best offensive player and took every difficult shot when the offense couldn’t work for a wide open shot... That’s why role players efficiencies are higher, they only take open shots m. Tony had prime LeBron James guarding him and a great team defense behind him.   I wish you knew just how wrong that is to say that it was Tony’s fault. If anyone’s fault it was Manu’s. Watch basketball, not basketball reference. That’s said, Tony did still underperform the last 2 games, but did enough late in game 6 that should have given the Spurs the title if Manu or Kawhi made both their FT’s or the Spurs gotten a rebound when they needed it. Even though it’s fair to say Tony did underperform, we’d have ran the risk of being swept without him."

LeBron James in the 2007 ECF scored 29 of Clevelands last 30 points including scoring 25 straight against the Pistons His team went up 3-2 and won the series. LeBron was already the same godamn animal before 2012.

"I forgot who broke it down, but someone long ago on YT adjust Scottie’s stats for modern NBA pace in the year he played without Jordan. They were insane. Basically Lebron James but with better rebounding and defense."
"Well one, my initial comment compared both peaks @ the same time of both careers. Your comment did not.  MJ has 9 seasons of ALL-NBA 1st team/ALL-NBA Defense  Lebron James has 5"
https://deadspin.com/lebron-james-has-obviously-never-been-a-waiter-388546  And then Dwyane Wade talked about how cheap he was in the past.
Just go back and look at their stats. They were very similar. Obviously James is the better player now and has had the better career but that year was a toss up and the Lebron media hype won over the fact that Melo was playing in significant minutes for a playoff team.
"how was Cuban 100% right? Does he seriously believe that any defense can hold prime Lebron James to 8 points in a finals game?  Sure they played amazing defense, but theres no defense in the world that can hold lebron to 8 points"
"So this'll be long but basically it's like this. There are 30 teams and each plays 82 games in the regular season. 15 of those teams are in the western conference, 15 are in the eastern conference. Teams play the teams in their conference 4 times a year, and the teams in the other conference 2 times a year.  At the end of the regular season, the top 8 teams from each conference are seeded into a playoff bracket based on their w/l record. Playoff series are best of 7 games. Whoever wins the playoffs wins the NBA championship. Right now, we would normally be in the playoffs, but it's been suspended/cancelled for obvious reasons.  Now for the game itself. The most basic rules are simple, and you probably know them already. Putting the ball through the basket gives your team 2 points, except if you shoot it from behind the 3-point line (also called the arc, the perimeter, and a couple other names) which gets you 3 points instead. You need to dribble to run with the ball. Each possession has a 24 second shot clock, which means that once a team gets possession of the ball, they have 24 seconds to make a shot or they lose possession. If you get fouled, you get to shoot undisturbed from the free throw line, and each made shot from there gets you one point (some fouls though just turn over possession to the other team but you'll figure out details like that as you go). There are a lot of other rules but that's what you need to know for now.  There are five positions in basketball (point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center), but generally speaking this can be simplified to three types of players: guards, wings, and bigs. Below I'll describe in broad strokes what each kind of player does, but there are dozens of exceptions, so don't be surprised when you notice a player that's not conforming to the positions and playstyles I describe.  Guards are the smallest (and often quickest) players, and they have the ball in their hands the most. Their best skills are often (but not always) playmaking, passing, and shooting. They most often operate around the perimeter (3-point line), setting up plays for their teammates and either passing the ball to a wing or big for a 2-point shot or getting open for a 3-point shot. Guards are usually 6""0-6""6. Examples include Steph Curry, Devin Booker, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving.  Wings are bigger players usually with longer wingspans. They set themselves up to receive the ball from guards closer to the basket, but are usually also good at shooting from beyond the three-point line if need be. They're typically stronger players that work to position themselves in such a way where they can get easy shots. Wings are usually 6""5-6""10. Examples include Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant.  Bigs are, as the name implies, the biggest and strongest (but usually the slowest) players. They traditionally play close to the basket, receiving entry passes and brute forcing close shots. Their size also makes them the most important players on defense (again, broadly speaking), since they're hard to shoot over and harder to overpower. They're also very good at getting rebounds, which is when a missed shot bounces off the rim and is collected by either team to gain or regain posession. Examples include Joel Embiid, Karl Anthony-Towns, Nikola Vucevic, and Anthony Davis.  I think that's all the info you need to get started. Let me know if you have any questions or need help picking a team or something. I can also help out if you have any questions about the playstyle of a team you're interested in or want to know more about a specific player. Happy to help"

" But the level to which LeBron locked up Rose is still amazing, even for those who watched every second of the series. [Via J.E. Skeets](http://twitter.com/jeskeets), ESPN's Stats and Info Department put together the data to show [how incredible James' defense on Rose was](http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=310526004&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines) in this series.  &gt;After going 0-for-5 from the floor with a turnover when guarded by LeBron James in Game 4, Derrick Rose struggled against him once again Thursday, going 1-for-10 with two turnovers in Game 5. Rose shot 6.3 percent from the floor in the series when defended by James, lowest among any player that defended him on five or more plays.  That's just unbelievable -- 1-15 for the MVP over two critical playoff games when defending by a player five inches taller and maybe 50 pounds heavier. There's a reason LeBron makes the All-Defense team every year, and while he'll continue to for the next several years. That's just unfair.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Seems like it was a lot of LBJ.

" **\[BR\] Trae Young may have changed his mind on who the GOAT is from MJ to LeBron James after watching ""Space Jam 2"": ""I feel like this movie gonna make me put LeBron #1, instead of #2...""**"
"It happened. If the votes split between Iggy and Curry, LeBron would have won and I don't think the media wanted to set that precedent because the only time it happened was in its inaugural year so the terms of it were pretty undefined at the time.    https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2839460-nba-refutes-claim-lebron-james-andre-iguodala-tied-in-2015-finals-mvp-voting   Of course the NBA disputed it because they don't want it to seem like voters collude on who to vote on to get a certain outcome instead of an honest outcome."
"After 3 hours of sifting through his shit this morning, ESPNs Adam Shefter can confirm that LeBron James, did in fact, eat corn for dinner. More news at 9."
"Houston and Portland did him right in the end. He did OK in NBA earnings in the end, and even surpassed MJ. MJ however made a killing with Nike.   Pippen had not so great agents made him focus on security rather than pay-day in short term burst. I guess analytics wasn't a big thing back then for some agents.   Modern day Pippen would be LeBron James. That's how big he is in a team, and seeing those kind of stats and not earning as much was shrewd business decision by the management, and poor foresight by Pippen's agents at that time."
&gt;Most Valuable Player?:   &gt;Giannis Antetokounmpo - 97% of the votes   &gt;LeBron James - 3%  eww
"Prime LeBron James put up 17/7/7 on 53% true shooting in a 6 game series....and he played overly passive for the moment, disappeared for stretches, and even went as far as only dropping a mere 8 points in game 4.....Lebron 2011 is the biggest chokejob by a superstar"
"Salary cap and max contracts weren't a thing back then. You aren't allowed to pay LeBron James what he's worth to your team, so he has a hell of a lot of power to demand other things instead. MJ *was* paid closer to what he was worth, so him leaving wouldn't be nearly as bad."
"PG: 2015-16 Stephen Curry  SG: 1990-91 Michael Jordan  SF: 2012-13 LeBron James  PF: 1985-86 Larry Bird or 2003-04 Kevin Garnett (not sure who is better to put here)  C: 1999-00 Shaquille O’Neal  The gravity of Curry + the gravity of O’Neal with LeBron and Jordan operating the offense would be absolutely ridiculous. I think I would lean Garnett’s peak over Bird’s peak here personally but I’m pretty conflicted, both are great off-ball players with elite passing vision, but I think I prefer Garnett’s defense masking potential O’Neal deficiencies over the better scoring from Bird when I already have 4 of the greatest scorers ever."

For my raptors it’s Lebron James   Lebronto
"LeBron took the later Champion Pistons to seven games in his first playoffs and then carried his ass team to the Finals the next year.   He took the later champion Big 3 Celtics to a 7 games showdown only losing to 5 points in the final game while having fucking Delonte West as the 2nd option.  He also carried his ass team to 60+ wins in his Cleveland days.  Sure he has less accolades, but no one can carry like LeBron James, he’s such a versatile player that can play and defend multiple positions with high BBIQ.   He is not Michael Jordan as a player, but he’s LeBron James that can make the whole team better. And he’s shown it again in the 2018 playoffs. Seriously what more do you want from the guy lol."
"That's an awful argument lol  &gt; He won two rings with stacked Miami teams   Duncan won his rings with 3 other Hall of Famers and a top 5 coach of all time   &gt; And those wins still needed Ray and Kyrie to bail him out for that to be the case.   They didn't ""bail him out"". Is LeBron James not allowed to have other teamates play good basketball? Did Paxton and Kerr bail Jordan out?  &gt; Timmy has beaten LeBron twice in the Finals  And was the best player in neither of them   &gt; 5 titles vs 3 titles, and Timmy was integral in all of them. Do the math.   He has two more championships. He does not make up for it in other aspects compared to LeBron"
being a shill or not doing anything at all hmmmm i wonder if we could do something about being presented with these decisions!!!!!  funny how you guys are outraged by lebron james not making statements about hong kong which might cost him income but u guys are quick to defend anyone else
"No theres not. Lebron is absolutely under zero circumstances one if the top 10 defenders of all time.   Thats one year out of 17.  Last year be was like the worst perimeter defender in the league. Heres one from the year before. 13th worst in the league lol.   https://www.basketballnetwork.net/is-lebron-james-an-overrated-defender/  Heres another one. 538s Raptor which gives him a defensive rating of 1.1, which is half of Jordans. And good for 13th out of the top 20 guys overall with 2 guys at 1.0 so basically 15th/20.  So yeah definitely no."
LeBron James was the best player in that series.
“My first takeaway is that this would be a complete and utter mismatch. I believe that if this were on national tv under huge pressure with the world watching...this could be internationally televised because...this would be EPIC. I believe LeBron would succumb to this pressure and be....UNABLE to deliver in the moment. “King” James would produce pebbles at best. As for Michael Jeffrey Jordan? He would not even need to wipe.”
"So this'll be long but basically it's like this. There are 30 teams and each plays 82 games in the regular season. 15 of those teams are in the western conference, 15 are in the eastern conference. Teams play the teams in their conference 4 times a year, and the teams in the other conference 2 times a year.   At the end of the regular season, the top 8 teams from each conference are seeded into a playoff bracket based on their w/l record. Playoff series are best of 7 games. Whoever wins the playoffs wins the NBA championship. Right now, we would normally be in the playoffs, but it's been suspended/cancelled for obvious reasons.  Now for the game itself. The most basic rules are simple, and you probably know them already. Putting the ball through the basket gives your team 2 points, except if you shoot it from behind the 3-point line (also called the arc, the perimeter, and a couple other names) which gets you 3 points instead. You need to dribble to run with the ball. Each possession has a 24 second shot clock, which means that once a team gets possession of the ball, they have 24 seconds to make a shot or they lose possession. If you get fouled, you get to shoot undisturbed from the free throw line, and each made shot from there gets you one point (some fouls though just turn over possession to the other team but you'll figure out details like that as you go). There are a lot of other rules but that's what you need to know for now.  There are five positions in basketball (point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center), but *generally speaking* this can be simplified to three types of players: guards, wings, and bigs. Below I'll describe in broad strokes what each kind of player does, but there are dozens of exceptions, so don't be surprised when you notice a player that's not conforming to the positions and playstyles I describe.   Guards are the smallest (and often quickest) players, and they have the ball in their hands the most. Their best skills are often (but not always) playmaking, passing, and shooting. They most often operate around the perimeter (3-point line), setting up plays for their teammates and either passing the ball to a wing or big for a 2-point shot or getting open for a 3-point shot. Guards are usually 6""0-6""6. Examples include Steph Curry, Devin Booker, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving.  Wings are bigger players usually with longer wingspans. They set themselves up to receive the ball from guards closer to the basket, but are usually also good at shooting from beyond the three-point line if need be. They're typically stronger players that work to position themselves in such a way where they can get easy shots. Wings are usually 6""5-6""10. Examples include Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant.  Bigs are, as the name implies, the biggest and strongest (but usually the slowest) players. They traditionally play close to the basket, receiving entry passes and brute forcing close shots. Their size also makes them the most important players on defense (again, broadly speaking), since they're hard to shoot over and harder to overpower. They're also very good at getting rebounds, which is when a missed shot bounces off the rim and is collected by either team to gain or regain posession. Examples include Joel Embiid, Karl Anthony-Towns, Nikola Vucevic, and Anthony Davis.  I think that's all the info you need to get started. Let me know if you have any questions or need help picking a team or something. I can also help out if you have any questions about the playstyle of a team you're interested in or want to know more about a specific player. Happy to help"
you're talking about /u/Pengweeno87 like he may not be LeBron James himself. I def think LBJ is more successful than Jalen Rose
"There’s a lot of mixed opinions out there on him, some people think he’s overhyped, some are convinced he’s a future #1 pick. It’s very possible that he never makes the NBA because in reality only 40 people get in per year, and at this point in time it’s not like he’s head and shoulders above his peers. I’ve mostly seen highlights but I did see him play in person one time in an AAU game and he’s a pretty exciting to watch. It’s hard to judge him now because he’s 15 years old (I was mistaken he’s actually a freshman) and hasn’t even grown into his body yet. He only has interest from Duke (and every other school basically) but I think he has an official offer from kentucky which is 100% premature, but he’s playing and competing against other players at this level getting similar types of offers, so it’s not really just because he’s Lebron James’ son. And he did play very little at Sierra Canyon this year but from what I heard he performed surprisingly well in the minutes he got. It’s probably insanely difficult for any freshman to get minutes though considering they had like 3 seniors who are top 20 prospects and Dwyane Wades son Zaire (senior) who struggled to get minutes too but still has a ton of D1 offers. Also I read somewhere that he is taller than Lebron was at this age so the size problem that he has now shouldn’t be a very big problem."
"Stats don't tell the story in context. There are many players with great stats who never won championships. Stats don't show us the adjustments they focus on the opposing teams, the improvements the make on their teammates, and etc. Some play have floated team to team while others stayed put throughout a career. Kobe and Duncan stayed had various iterations f their franchises built around them for example. LeBron has often been a grass is greener elsewhere player changing teams every few year to play with better pieces. It is impossible to know what the trajectory of James career would have been had he stayed on Cleveland his whole career. Meanwhile Kobe and Duncan might have a couple more rings a each had they went team hoping."
"I feel like we really stretch ourselves thin coming up with reasons why one is okay and one is not. It makes no difference to me that Lebron helped orchestrate his superteam. What, Bosh, Wade and Bron joining together makes what Lebron did totally different? That’s probably just circumstance. If our issue is how good the teams appeared to be at the time, it shouldn’t matter whether he put it together or not. He still went to a team people thought was super unfair at the time. People at the start of the previous decade were not saying this was okay because James planned it. Time has just softened the wound and we have a new guy to dislike.   Both moves were fine. It sucked for many of the fans because it hurts their chances of seeing their team win. But we should separate that from either guy doing anything wrong."
"&gt;Don't use shit like ""blind idiocy"" or ""delusional"". Just because you can't doesn't mean others can't. THere's a large gap between being invested in your team and being biased all the way ""blind idiocy"" and delusion.  Those are apt terms for diehard fanaticism. You can attempt to sugarcoat it if you wish. Funny that you say ""your team"", as if they belong to you in any way shape or form. The attachment is formed by yourself. They don't care about you individually, but you invest so much your time and emotion into their success.   &gt;They don't. The raptors fan sterotypes don't jjust appear out of nowhere. There's even raptors fans in this thread bringing it up.  They do actually. The same issues complained about towards Raptors fans exist elsewhere. Do you remember the witch hunt by r/Lakers against Woj who had a vendetta against the team? Why would they act in such a way if they are such a secure fanbase? Have you ever debated with a Kobe stan about his placement all time and disagreed with them, and then been preached at as if you committed some cardinal sin? These people attach their own emotions to the team and star players. So if you attack the team, its like you've attacked them.   &gt;They do now. When they first started winning there was a definite sense of ""why does everyone hate us, we're the underdogs"".   I don't know what we're talking about anymore. You just said they do now. So then what are you talking about? Who cares when they first started winning, what about after Draymond kicked Adams in the nuts? What about after Draymond mocked the Cavs in a drunken rant? What about after KD joined? Not all Warriors fans were mystified at why people disliked them. Great teams often are disliked. Especially if their success comes at the expense of other huge fanbases, like LeBron James.   &gt;Everyone fanbase doesn't boo their own players like Philly does, Clippers fans don't have the same attitude about being good as Laker fans do, Suns fans would experience a championship much different than Celtics fans would. List goes on and on.  Sure they do. Do you remember the Blazers booing Meyers Leonard last year. Do you not see fanbases on this sub crap on players they feel are underperforming and blocking minutes from others who deserve to start. You also need to realize that if the Suns ever became good enough to win a title, they'd attract a bunch of bandwagoners who support the team for individual players or talent. They wouldn't necessarily experience a championship more so than a fan of the franchise. Also, you assume that Boston fans even supported the team in 2009. A Celtics fan may experience as much joy with a title as a Suns fan would."
"I have an idea for him if I was his PR.. Lebron James effectively closed the door to Durant pulling a similar move to his old team so that's out. It would seem like he was trying to copy the move and all and he'd get clowned. And I don't think going to the Wizards in Washington D.C. (his hometown) would have that much of an effect either.  So what he could do is lobby hard to revive the Seattle Supersonics as an expansion team. The only issue is the league is in no way shape or form ready to expand their product yet. But there's nothing saying he can't do this later and even be a minority owner. I think it would really flip the script. He's and Jeff Green are the last remaining Seattle Supersonics actively playing in the league so it's pretty well situated. Feel free to steal this, Kevin. :P"

"&gt;I just don’t feel the need to defend him because it’s not like they’re personally attacking me  You hit the nail on the head and I don't think people are understanding what a stan actually is. You're just a lowkey, normal fan that fucks with KD heavy. I respect that as well.  In contrast, Kobe stans were at my neck for the entire 2000s(middle school, high school, and college) b/c I believed MJ and pre-championship Bron were better than him. I'm not even a Bron stan but they would make jokes like ""Why can't you ask LeBron James for change for a dollar? B/c he can only give you three quarters."" MJ is my personal pick for GOAT but I tried to reason with them based off stats and Bron's overall game even though he hadn't won a ring yet.  They wouldn't hear it and were in constant defense mode, which I respect b/c they ride and die for Kobe. They felt like I was attacking their guy when I was just stating my opinion with no animus towards Kobe. To me that's the definition of standom.

"&gt; Comparing one season of bird  except I'm not.  Bird attempted less than 1.5 3s per game in 81, 82, 83, and 84.  Bird shot 26% on 3s across those 4 seasons.  In seasons where Bird attempted 1.5 or more 3s, his career average is 40%.  It's not like he magically became a better shooter between those seasons.  He shot 40% as a rookie when he averaged 1.7 attempts per game, same as his career average.  Attempting more than a token number of 3s per game has an impact on how closely your 3pt% reflects your actual ability.  With Jordan, it's tough to gauge because he took so few in the regular season.  Excluding the years with the shortened line, I think he averaged around 1.2 3pt attempt per game for his career.  That's really low.  However, Jordan did take more 3s in the post season and I think those number are more reflective of his true ability.  With the regular line, Jordan's career postseason 3pt% is 34.5%.  That is better than modern players like James Harden 33.3%, Lebron James 33.2%.  And it's pretty close to Kevin Durant 35.2% and Dame Lillard 35.3%."
"Such a lazy and inaccurate take, and also a sign that you haven't taken the time to watch MJ's old playoff games.  MJ basically didn't shoot 3s in the regular season except for a handful of seasons.  He shot more 3s in the playoffs though and his playoff shooting stats are more informative as a result.  MJ's playoff 3pt% with the regular line is 34.5%  Compare to modern players like Kevin Durant - 35.2%, Lebron James, 34.4%, James Harden 33.3%  MJ's 3s point shooting ability really wasn't that bad."

"Aka Dr Lebron James, PhD in Theory of Projectory Basketball"
Shane Battier was said to be very bright. https://www.slamonline.com/archives/lebron-james-shane-battier-the-smartest-player-and-person-in-basketball/  He also supposedly worked with raw analytic data in Houston with Hinkie and Morey.
"You know, it's kind of crazy. Growing up through the 90's I remember the doldrums of post-Bad Boys Pistons basketball. Seemed like the Pistons were irrelevant forever, with a brief blip thanks to Grant Hill.   But now here we are in 2020, and this era's Pistons is irrelevant for going on 12 years now, blowing out the Terry Mills era for irrelevancy by a long shot. It's crazy how fast time flies. You blink and you don't even notice it until a clip like this gets posted where you're reminded that Detroit had a Kwame Brown era.  That said, watching Jonas Jerebko and Kwame Brown try to work together to handle a high screen against LeBron is pretty hilarious to watch. And sad. But all you can do is laugh, or at least pretend it's funny, just because it's so sad.  I'm sad.  Edit: Actually, the more times I watch the funnier it gets. I can too easily picture John Kuester drawing up that set during a TV time-out a moment earlier.  *Alright, Jonas Jerebko, we're going to have you step out and guard LeBron James 35 feet away from the hoop. Don't worry, he probably won't have an answer for that. Kwame Brown, you do that thing where you blindly sprint toward Anderson Verejao's back but make sure you're veering toward the sideline. We want LeBron to believe the lane's there for the taking. Highly inexperienced rookie small forward Austin Daye? This is where you come in. When the time comes, you'll probably know what to do. Alright come on guys, New Age Bad Boys on three.*"
Got to think Lebron James has camera crew following him around for the final years of his career for a documentary.
George Washington = Bill Russell   Thomas jefferson = Bird/Magic   Abraham lincoln = Michael Jordan   Teddy Roosevelt = Lebron James
Shaq was like the LeBron James for centers during his heyday.  Dude just overpowered people but was very very very good at getting the ball in the hoop.
#LEBRON RAYMONE JAMES WOULD NEVER
"&gt;There were some extenuating circumstances (playing next to the 2 best shooters ever) that would prevent me personally from calling it a GOAT-tier performance  I'm not sure how KD playing with Steph &amp; Klay is relevant into this conversation, do you think someone like Harrison Barnes (or literary anyone else) would've putting up those kind of numbers KD did on insane 70% TS He's one of the best scorers in NBA history who can shoot everyone. Going by you reasoning, then anyone can easily discredit a rando all-time great's performance due to having a stacked team...   &gt;Its just that LeBron James averaged a 33 point triple double on 63% true shooting over the 2 finals.  Why do you ignore their respective shooting splits?  Kevin Durant: 55.6/47.4/92.7  LeBron James: 55.6/38.7/64.9  And I'm not really sure how doing a triple double makes LeBron ahead of KD. I mean, people generally don't rate Russell Westbrook ahead of KD despite putting up a triple double for 3 straight seasons. Something nobody has done in NBA history."
"Yeah, thats not even a neg on KD. There were some extenuating circumstances (playing next to the 2 best shooters ever) that would prevent me personally from calling it a GOAT-tier performance, but it was still amazing to see. Its just that LeBron James averaged a 33 point triple double on 63% true shooting over the 2 finals. Thats GOAT shit. Its a damn shame we didn't get to see super saiyan James play against the non-KD warriors for longer. Would've been some great series."
" [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/23684417/kevin-pelton-weekly-mailbag-does-lebron-james-make-teammates-better](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23684417/kevin-pelton-weekly-mailbag-does-lebron-james-make-teammates-better)   I welcome your source that shows otherwise.  &gt;Curry gets shut down also in the finals once a year. Lebron is consistently great scoring wise.  Yet, because of Curry's scoring ability he still has a huge impact just by running around the perimeter. Curry's struggles in the finals are heavily overrated.  &gt;What you are saying doesn’t make sense.  That's what happens when you came come to terms with facts. What I'm saying can be supported with statistics and the opinions of top coaches like Phil and Pop."
"Damn see that's what I said people look back at it not how it was, wade was putting up 30/5/8 with a 58 ts% with elite defense, with a worse team than lebron, of course lebron won MVP the heat were much worse, 2nd best player was rookie Michael Beasley   But check out some articles from the time  https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/sports/basketball/17juicebox.html  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2009-04-13-0904120175-story,amp.html  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/910565-5-reasons-why-dwyane-wade-is-better-than-lebron-james  Plus in 09 wade beat lebron in every statical category except rebounds, and to this day is the only player with 2000 points, 500 assists, 150 steals and 100 blocks,   I can always tell when people who didnt watch back then because they always think lebron was just considered the best. But no ot wasn't until later that people started saying lebron had a better year, although at the TIME wade was considered the top guy in the regular season,.but brom and Kobe went crazy in the playoffs. At the worst people had kobe, lebron and wade as 1a, 1b, 1c."
"So you're saying if you started a basketball hall of fame from scratch you're not including players from the 40s and 50s?  Why stop there? Why don't we exclude players from the 60s and 70s?   You're on a slippery slope man and the reality is in 80 years people may look back at the 2010s and 2000s like we look back at the 1940s and 1950s. Does that mean Lebron James and Tim Duncan shouldn't be hall of famers?  No matter what way you look at it, George Mikan was the best basketball player in the world for a period of time and he shouldn't be looked over just because it was a long time ago."
&gt;  I've never thought of LeBron James as a scorer  I mean he's only 3rd all time in it
"Obviously I can't speak to Wilt, but LeBron is clearly more athletic than Jordan. Jordan was ridiculously athletic, but he didn't have that insane mix of vert, speed, and strength that James and other GOAT athletes did. A lot more of his dominance relied on skill, whereas young Bron and Wilt dominated off of their athletics alone.  To avoid an argument from MJ stans, Im separating the concepts of ""athlete"" and ""sports players""  When I think GOAT athletes I think the most athletic people ever  When I think GOAT sports players I think Gretzky, Ruth, and MJ"
"Yeah by the time he got to Miami he had already lost a significant amount of athleticism.   He was still probably the most athletic human being on the planet, but in those early Cavs years Lebron wasn't even human.. it was like watching an violent, uncaged Siberian tiger that had been genetically modified to play basketball:  https://streamable.com/5hu5sv  https://streamable.com/d0pejz  https://streamable.com/blb67c  Honestly man.. I've seen so many ridiculous posts over the last few weeks suggesting that if you put James in the 80s, he somehow wouldn't succeed. It just shows how quickly people forget . Put him in 1986 and the only question would be how many orbital fractures and dislocated discs would be obtained from those players trying to stop him at that point in time."
"Back when Lebron was good.  ""Lebron James! With no regard for human life!"""
"I don't think it is that big of a knock to have a rough year. I am willing to bet that with that team around him Lebron James would struggle to look as good as he normally does, he probably would look considerably worse. I think it is fair to assume that once Steph went down we were not seeing a very motivated Dray, and a guy like him cannot play well without keeping himself motivated because his value doesn't come from the things that carry over when you are not playing hard (like shooting)."
True they are just one player away.   That one player happens to be either lebron james or kawhi Leonard.
"Funny how you can say that with zero proof whatsoever as we have never seen those teams play without LeBron James.  2011 Cavs were dismantled after LeBron's departure and also had major injuries in that season. 2015 Heat were a playoff team up until Chris Bosh had fucking blood clots, in fact they were seen as the biggest threat to LeBron's Cavs that year. 2019 Cavs had Kevin Love play only 22 games and didn't have Kyrie Irving anymore.  But ofc you can tell teams with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love or Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh would struggle to make the playoffs without LeBron without ANY evidence."
"Discussion?  There isn’t any, no way this guy is better than LeBron James at basketball"
"B/c he literally said ""my name is in the hat"" when asked about playing. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.si.com/.amp-lakers/nba/lakers/news/lebron-james-undecided-on-2020-olympics-games&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj0zvudu5LpAhUHUK0KHdWGD7AQxbwDMB56BAgLEAM&amp;usg=AOvVaw0hXIXmRR5ZsZS5uVrFRXYx&amp;ampcf=1"
LeBron James  Lichael Jordon  Lennis Jodman Leph Jurry Lobe Jryant
"If legacy was really determined by team and play off success, Tony Parker would be unanimously considered as a top 10 PG. He has four rings, and is top 10 (overall, not for a PG) in PO points and assists.  The three other players who match this are Lebron James, Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. But Parker played with Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili and was coached by Pop so most of the redditors grannies would have reached the same numbers, he just had to be there. Once a month you have ""serious"" discussions whether Parker had a better career than guys who have yet to make a conference final."
LeBron James
"&gt;Jordan was like 6’6” and 200 pounds and LeBron was 6’8” and 260. I feel like it is pretty easy to understand.   Yeah.   And only *one* of them had to face a defensive strategy that involved what would be straight up assault anywhere else but an NBA court, or a boxing ring.   And it wasn't the 6'8"" 260 lb baby.   LeBron would play one game against the '88 Pistons and elect not to come back out at halftime because he was crying to his momma on the phone.   ""*sniff sniff* but momma, I'm LeBron James! Why do they think they can treat me like this?? I should have just played football. Wahhhh""   Your confusing LeBron's physicality with his mental toughness/drive.   The former is almost unmatched in NBA history, the latter is almost unmatched as well, but for the exact opposite reasons lmao   If LeBron had Jordan, Kobe, or even DWade's mentality he would be hands down the GOAT. Period.   But he's an entitled brat coasting off his biological blessings. I don't hate him for being him, just don't try to coast into a man's league when you're just a boy rolling in on your Hummer Nike awarded you when you were 18.   Do you LeBron. Just don't pretend to be something you're not.   You're not the ""goat."" You're not ""the chosen one."" You're a talented kid using basketball as a means to fuel your narcissism and desire to be rich.   He's a glorified Penny Hardaway. (A reference im sure you don't appreciate lol)"
"You know what, I have been watching Lebron James for a long time, and I’ll tell you something, he’s a brilliant strategist. Like I always say, his basketball IQ is off the charts, he’s a savant. And I’ll tell you that just reading between the lines, it kind of seems like Lebron might have just fabricated the whole Covid-19 virus to avoid having to me the Clippers and Kawhi Leonhard in the finals and dropping to 3-7. I think he knows that his claim for goat diminishes each time he loses in the finals and he’s now got the perfect excuse to avoid having to go there and yes, lose, his tenth nba finals. Michael Jeffrey Jordan, the true goat, lost 0 by the way. He’s running from the finals like he runs from the free throw line late in games, because he’s smart and he knows he’d lose. That’s just the way it seems to me, knowing Lebron and reading between the lines"
"My point is 1/6 is a whole lot worse than 3/6. If other dudes didn't have that killer instinct or make the play then that's an L for James.  Okay let's rewind, remember I said peak I take Larry. In those situations he nails a three. Dude was a killer. MJ always found a way too. LeBron didn't. LeBron isn't that guy. But he does have great stats and won a lot. Definitely an all time great."
"People who are paying attention.    Here's the Heat's cap situation in 2 years:    Player | Salary ---|--- Jimmy Butler | 36.0m Tyler Herro | 4.0m KZ Okpala| 1.5m Chris Silva | 1.5m Ryan Anderson (dead cap) | 5.2m   That's it. Now here are the cap holds Miami has:    Player| Cap Hold ---|--- Bam Adebayo| 12.8m Kendrick Nunn | 2.1m Duncan Robinson | 2.1m  All up that's 65m allocated for the 2021-22 season and they'll have ~60-70m in free cap space. Now, let's look at who's going to be a free agent for that season:   * Lebron James * Giannis Antetokounmpo  * Anthony Davis * Kawhi Leonard * Paul George * Damian Lillard * Bradley Beal  So when those stars look to team up in what will be a historical free agency, where do you think they'll go?  Miami can sign two of those guys, and offer them Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, some good role players, a respected coach and the Miami lifestyle. Plus, because they're still competing hard while they wait the reputation of their team culture is still intact.  People don't see it, but Miami are trying to recreate 2010's *The Decision*. All of their contracts are based around maximising their 2021 FA chances. As a team they're definitely not close to a title, as a franchise they could win in the next couple of years."
LeBron James
So Lebron James agrees with Trump.
Speak for yourself my friend I know who it is. Lebron James.

i doubt lebron james knows what every exec and agent are saying. He can only speak for himself and the people he speaks with which presumably is only his own agent and the execs of the lakers
&gt;Teammate **game winning** shots that won Lebron James 2 of his 3 titles
"They're not going to put him in as an all star at a position he's played a couple of times, when he will go in at his primary position  Same thing applies to Paul George.  Players get Into the all star game at the position they primarily play at. If either of them were like, say, Jimmy Butler, Giannis a few years ago, etc who spilts his tone pretty evenly between being a guard and a forward, that'd be one thing. But both Paul George and LeBron James are primarily towards who sometimes play guard. Are you telling me you think you think Kevon Looney is a point to guard because he played one game at the point? Are you telling me Magic Johnson is a center because he played a few games at center?"
Teammate game winning shots that won Lebron James 2 of his 3 titles  Ray Allen   Kyrie Irving
"Case in point: [“Irving, back to James!!!”](https://youtu.be/0bXg9nofz4I)  Also [this one by LeBron, from JR.](https://youtu.be/lLxbeVbvP3M)"
I feel what potentially hurts LeBron in the GOAT debate (tangibles aside) is that he generally comes off as less serious and more fun-loving than MJ. I’m sure James is serious but his social media I think subtly takes some edge away from his overall public persona.
Thats actually hilariously asinine by James. To claim they are like slave owners why? Because they talk to you like you're beneath them? Like maybe they re your boss in the NFL and you aren't your own coach like Lebron is. You're making 20 million a year playing fucking football there is no slave owner mentality for fucks sake.
"The best comparison for Scottie Pippen is LeBron James. I know LeBron is the better all around player, but Scottie Pippen is a lot closer to LeBron James than he is to Jimmy Butler or Paul George.    Maybe ""diet"" LeBron would be the best comp for Scottie."
"I get that he says he professional which I believe, however there is no sense of professionalism with the media or honestly just manners. He comes off as rude when and arrogant. You think the casual fan is listening RoCo interviews or reading a long winded article on how he is misunderstood, hell no. People see short video clips of him going viral because he talks to the media like trash.   Nephews here might call me a hater but there is a huge difference between how a LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Paul Milsap, and hell Jimmy Butler interact with the media. It's really his own fault that he gets this shitty press coverage cause he talks shitty to the media"
"Just giving you alittle shit.   I also think calling the Kardashians talentless hacks is alittle silly. Sure they don't provide anything special but you don't stay this popular, for this long, and make that much money without knowing what you're doing. They are master self promoters. Kim Kardashians has used her celebrity influence to help pardon people from prison so I can't completly hate them.   LeBron James is popular for being good at getting a ball into a net. The Kardashians are popular for being hot. I don't see a huge difference when you break it down like that. Being that rich and this famous for throwing a ball into the a hoop is about as silly as being that famous and that rich for looking good yet we only give the Kardashians shit. I don't understand it."

"SG Harden James, SF James Lebron the boss, C Bosh Chris, PG Chris Paul, PF Paul George. 67-15 don't @ me."
"Plus back then his team would  have had their own enforcers too. People act like MJ didn’t play with Rodman, Oakley, Cartwright , etc.   Imagine how dumb you would have to be to start an altercation with a team whose shooting guard is 6’9 250lbs , and he’s not even the main enforcer lmao .. we would be watching docs about Lebron James and the Funeral Boys because a man could have died on the court"
"Its been a a few weeks since the NBA season has returned after a grueling few months without NBA action. The NBA finally decided (after months of deciding) to continue the season at the Disney Land World Resort in Orlando.  LeBron James and the Lakers after beating the Oklahoma City Thunder on court number 4 at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, in what was a game full of technicals, flagrant fouls, and players getting into a shoving fest, decided to go to Epcot in a suggestion by Coach Frank Vogel.  LeBron is having a deep conversation with AD about what it's going to take to win a championship. Danny Green overhears the conversation and buds in. Other Laker players are admiring Epcot while Jared Dudley and Dwight Howard are cracking jokes with the rest of the team.

Rondo on some random bench is talking to himself, isolated from everyone, the coaches, players, and medical staff.   ""That fucker. That mother of a fucker. Stupid bitch. I fucking had him!"" Rondo says to himself. During the game with OKC, Rondo had his ankles broken by Chris Paul, and the play is trending all over Twitter all while Chris Paul dropped 40 on Rondo's head.  The time is now approaching 9 p.m just enough time for the team to look around. Coach Vogel says, ""Alright everyone wrap it up, take your last pictures, we got a game tomorrow against the Warriors to clinch the first seed.""  The players start to walk out of the Epcot area, when they run into OKC who were coming from the Beach Club Villas from the Northside. The teams in an awkward run in don't say anything, but there is a lot of tension, but teams are holding themselves back. At this point Rondo is beyond mad, he's absolutely fuming, he sees Chris Paul. From 10 feet away, Rondo spits at Chris Paul's face. ""WHAT'S UP F*CK N***A"". Steven Adams in quick response, holds Chris Paul back, ""Mate it's not worth it."" All of a sudden, Dennis Schroder smacks the hell out of Quinn Cook  Absolute hell breaks loose! Teams start to beat the living shit out of each other. It's a rumble between players and coaches. Dwight in one corner is fighting Nerlens Noel, Chris Paul and Rondo are on the ground beating the living hell out of each other, Billy Donovan is smacking the fuck out of Frank Vogel, Alex Caruso and Kyle Kuzma are fighting off Danilo Gallinari and Terrance Ferguson.

Everyone stops what they're doing. Adam is in a leopard dress with a diamond necklace and gold earrings on. ""What the fuck"" exclaims Chris Paul.  Adam Silver shouts, ""Everybody get the fuck back to your rooms! I was in the middle of my photoshoot and you guys ended it for me. I don't want to have to come back or you'll really be shocked.

"There is plenty of things you can get mad about but why post such an easily refutable lie?   &gt;“In the NFL they got a bunch of old white men owning teams and they got that slave mentality,” James said. “And it’s like, ‘This is my team. You do what the fuck I tell y’all to do. Or we get rid of y’all.’”  Doesn't matter if he is right or wrong but he certainly didn't claim ""sports are similar to slavery"". He was specifically talking about NFL owners.   And the ""owner-governor"" debate was kicked off by Draymond Green not LeBron. (also on ""The Shop"")  &gt;Green spoke about his thoughts on the term ""owner"" during an appearance on HBO's The Shop, saying teams should move toward terms like ""CEO or chairman.""  &gt;""You shouldn't say 'owner,'"" Green said. ""When you think of a basketball team, nobody thinks of the fuckin' Golden State Warriors and think of that damn bridge. They think of the players that make that team...you don't even know what the fuck [the bridge] is called.""  &gt;Jon Stewart, who brought up the topic in the episode and is white, noted that sports are ""purely the labor of people."" That is in contrast to other businesses, where some jobs may not have any physical labor and are thus seen as less problematic when it comes to the term ""owner.""  &gt;Green has been speaking out against the term since 2017."
"So many lebron james no rings memes, ruined!"
"Does it not matter to you at all that the pace of play was ridiculously fast when Wilt played?  In his famous 50/26 season, he averaged about 40 points and 20 rebounds per 100 possessions.   For comparison, in 2008-09, LeBron averaged about 41/11/10...in 2005-06, Kobe averaged 45/7/6...from 1994-95 through 2001-02, Shaq averaged basically 39/16...in 2018-19, James Harden averaged 48/9/10...Giannis this season averaged 44/20...and Jordan FOR HIS ENTIRE CAREER averaged over 40 per 100 possessions."
Oh God I just posted the same.😂😂😂  Michael Jordan = Luke Skywalker  LeBron James = Anakin Skywalker
Wow. Tristan must be a really strong dude to just casually send fucking LeBron James flying like that.
"To name one, MJ in early 90's because of his gambling addiction entered in contact with actual criminals. Go anche check James Bouler story.  Just one, imagine today the world discovering that Lebron James or KD are involved with drug dealers for some shady business.   Imagine how devastating this would be for their reputation, for their fanbase and most important for their sponsorships."
If you post the most athletic guy at every position what would it look like? I got  PG - Russel Westbrook  SG - ???  SF - Lebron James  PF - Charles Barkely (or Karl Marlone)  C - Shaq (or Wilt)
LeBron James is not very good at flopping.  But he doesn't even need to try with these refs on the floor.
**PG:** James Harden  **SG:** Kawhi Leonard   **SF:** LeBron James  **PF:** Giannis  **C:** Shaq
Lebron james is 100% gonna pull it off I'll guarantee it.
If it's based off of fit:  - Stephen Curry  - Michael Jordan  - LeBron James  - Kevin Garnett  - Hakeem Olajuwon  If it's based on just the all time scale:  - Magic Johnson  - Michael Jordan  - LeBron James  - Tim Duncan  - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
"Bruh why the fuck does lebron James always fall backwards like that??  It’s liked he’s slipping on a rug or wearing socks and the floor is polished.   Everyone’s always like Lebrons a freight train, yah until he has to start walking backwards - then he turns into a toddler on skates."
"For someone to say Lebron James avoids driving, you clearly didn’t watch him play when he was in his 20s.   Lebron’s rookie year handchecking was still legal, and there were plenty of old school players still around when he first came into the league. Guys like Alonzo Mourning and Kenyon Martin were still playing. Heck Brendan Haywood (in ops clip) literally played with Jordan,  MJ liked him because he was an enforcer.   I’ve never rooted for the guy and one of the main reasons was he would always get away with offensive fouls when the Cavs played the Wizards. If Lebron played in an era where he was allowed to swing elbows like Malone and Barkley did, none of that bullshit you’re talking about would be happening to him lol. I am telling you he would hospitalize opposing players in the 80s-90s  if he was allowed to play under those rules."

"Even if feet don't grow through time (they can get a bit swollen with age, though)... nba's players feet definitely get fucked up through time (look up Lebron [NSFL](http://pulledmygroin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lebron-james-toes.png) and Harden's feet [NSFL](http://pulledmygroin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/james-harden-toes.jpg).

Bro I was watching in the mid 80's were you?   You are talking about one poll  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/jordan-lebron-goat-debate-americans-jordan-2019-3%3famp  https://www.google.com/amp/s/lebronwire.usatoday.com/2019/04/08/anonymous-poll-of-nba-players-has-lebron-far-behind-jordan-in-goat-debate/amp/  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-whos-the-real-goat-michael-jordan-or-lebron-james/amp/  They have one that just asks about LeBron and MJ and while LeBron gets 18% Jordan is at 82%. Over 4 times more. That's includes recency bias
"You mean to say that Oscar was the system. He didn't need a system designed around him to accentuate his strengths because his strengths defined what the system would be. That is to his advantage and you don't get to take this away from him in some sort of handicap in favor of Wilt. Creative ball handlers like Oscar also faced restrictions in how they could dribble the ball, so it's not as if Wilt were the only player who faced such issues.   It is certainly not clear that Wilt was a better offensive player than Oscar. As I said before, his teams were consistently the best offense in the league. That is super impressive. And it is not clear that Wilt would be the best offensive player in the league if he played today. A lot of the stuff he did, like staying in games whether the score was out of reach or not and having an entre team cater to his touches, wouldn't fly today due to the increased talent pool of the NBA and his volume would be much lower as a result. He also would not be as strong a playmaker as the likes of LeBron James, nor the likes of Curry who does so both on ball and through off ball creation. Also, modern rules don't really favor post players. So I don't think the advantage exists as much as you think."
Biz jumps into Lebron with forward momentum thus not having established verticaility. Then makes contact with the body of James thus resulting in a defensive foul
"I agree that Siakam proved more, but *a lot* more? Tatum was the #1 option when they went to game 7 against LeBron James in the East Finals less than 2 years ago."
"The rest of the team totally didn't play a huge part in that sweep as well... [oh wait](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2018-nba-western-conference-first-round-pelicans-vs-trail-blazers.html)  The Lakers aren't -2.8 with Davis on the court in James' absence and 11.2 vice versa...

"Watch the clip again. LeBron James was WIIIDDDEE open, and JR had ample opportunity to pass the ball to him. Ya know what gives a team a better chance at winning than overtime? A wide open 3 to win the game by one of the best players ever in the middle of his most clutch playoff run ever"

LeBron James - DNP (Coronavirus)
Entourage: it's like LeBron James eating paella in Spain.
"LeBron James  'My man InsanityInIsolation is in need, donate to him at &lt;link&gt;, and I'll give you some swag. #LiveLaughLove #kidfromakron`"
Lebron James  “I wish the Holocaust really happened”
LeBron James. “I still see JJ Barea in my nightmares.”
"Yeah, Anthony Davis handled that situation horribly. And you didn't even mention the fact that LeBron James coasted through the 2019 season because he was just waiting for AD to get there."
"Early 2017  &gt;The rift began last week on TNT’s *Inside the NBA* when Barkley took aim at James for publicly scolding Cleveland Cavaliers management about its inability to secure better players as the reeling Cavs seek to defend their title. Barkley called the comments “[whiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9SE_ZYOPAM)” and “inappropriate.”   &gt;   &gt;At first, James let those comments brush off his shoulders. Then on Monday [he let loose](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18589897/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-throws-gauntlet-charles-barkley-hater), via ESPN’s Dave McMenamin. Calling Barkley a “hater,” he launched into a diatribe about Barkley’s off-court behavior during and after his playing career.   &gt;   &gt;“I’m not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that,” James said. “I’m not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas. I never said, ‘I’m not a role model.’ I never showed up to All-Star Weekend on Sunday because I was in Vegas all weekend partying.   &gt;   &gt;“All I’ve done for my entire career is represent the NBA the right way. Fourteen years, never got in trouble. Respected the game. Print that.”   &gt;   &gt;Barkley also clearly hit a nerve when he alluded to James and, by association, his business team as Cleveland’s de facto general manager, urging the Cavs to sign J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert last season. It bothered James because he feels the criticism is partly leveled at Rich Paul, his childhood friend who’s now become a successful agent representing numerous players.  [https://theundefeated.com/features/barkley-on-lebron-my-criticism-was-fair/](https://theundefeated.com/features/barkley-on-lebron-my-criticism-was-fair/)"
bro this ain’t in a court of law. It’s perfectly justified to believe that Bron had de facto GM decision making with cleveland and LA. You can’t simply just say he absolutely had NOTHING to do with management when he’s LeBron fucking James. Don’t be naive
Anthony Davis is better than Kawhi Leonard? The Anthony Davis who is totally inept at leading the team without LeBron James? Is this a joke?   Literally only Lakers fans would say dumb shit like this.
"Cool, then they would have gone to the Bulls. That simple.   &gt;It’s clear Wade and James considered the Bulls and Knicks before choosing the Heat. One of the reasons Miami won the sweepstakes is because it had enough cap space for three max players, so it was also able to sign Bosh along with Wade and James.  &gt;“When we were trying to make a decision of what city we wanted to play in or what we wanted to be, we had to keep our options open,” Wade said to Richardson and Miles. “Chicago was on top of both of our lists. They had two max contracts and they had a young [Derrick] Rose. They had a Luol Deng, they had [Joakim] Noah, they had all these pieces. So I’m like, ‘In Chicago, in one of the biggest markets?’  &gt;“Pat goes, ‘All right, Chris — let me tell you something. I’ll make it simple.’ He says the Heat have enough cap space to bring in me and LeBron, and also to keep Dwyane. Then he takes off his suit jacket, rolls up his sleeves, and empties something on the table. HAHA! It’s a straight-up bagful of championship rings. Rolling around on the conference table, right in front of us. And then Pat looks at me, looks at my dad, and he says, “This right here ... this is what it’s about, guys.”  https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nba/miami-heat/article229938714.html  They straight up go to Miami only because they can load up with another star player. You think Pat Riley was going to turn down their offer of all going to the Heat because he might have not liked a player? They could have picked Mario Chalmers as the 3rd player and Pat Riley would have agreed to it rofl.  Edit: Changed ""Chicago"" to ""Miami"". Typo on my part."
"[Lombardi] /u/ashleyOoO when his girl asks him which current nba players are HOFers: John Wall or LeBron James. “I don’t compare John Wall with anybody,” Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a tattoo of John Wall. “I’ll let you interpret that however you want,” he said."
"My personal ""What if?"" is if the Grizzlies had won the 2003 lottery. We had our pick #1 overall protected. We got 2nd so it went to Detroit. If we had won that lottery, we would have had Lebron James. Would we have won a title with Lebron and Pau?"
"he's right.  lebron's tweet was a joke, I can't believe how brain washed people are to defend that.  ""every time we step outside were hunted.""  That's an outright lie, inflammatory and divisive.  He's a 35 year old man with millions of kids following him he needs to do better.  We've gone from martin luther king 'I have a dream' to lebron james shit posting on twitter."
"Sure thing. I also failed to mention that I incorporated Win Shares as well as games played, since nobody makes the Hall as a player on only a couple of peak seasons.   Three caveats to the list:   1. For anyone upset with MJ at #5, those years playing baseball hurt him in basically every category as he wasn't adding to his already impressive list of accolades (would've meant additional All-Stars, All-NBAs, Win Shares, Gs Played and potentially All-Defense). Similarly, Magic is hurt by having his career interrupted/cut short by HIV. 2. Finding a list of all players with an NBA championship is very difficult and would be very time-consuming (and manual) for me, so while it contributes to the overall score of each player, the list of players that have titles to their names is incomplete (particularly if they have just 1), so the list should definitely be considered a work-in-progress. 3. It is a ranking of careers, not talent or peak skill level. So if you think I have slighted Wilt or Bill Russell in any way, just know that every single player in the top-21 of this list has double-digit All-Stars, 9+ All-NBA (10+ if you exclude KG) and several have double-digit All-Defense selections as well. I elected to make MVP, DPOY and ROY binary as this was originally intended to be predictive of Hall consideration and haven't revisited that decision since, though there is probably a good case to do so as multiple MVPs is indicative of a very impressive career. So, again, work in progress.  Without further ado, here is the list (as well as the scores for the top-20):  1. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (43.37) 2. Tim Duncan (42.23) 3. Kobe Bryant (40.76) 4. LeBron James (39.77) 5. Michael Jordan (37.51) 6. Shaquille O'Neal (35.69) 7. Karl Malone (34.85) 8. **Hakeem Olajuwon (34.00)** 9. Kevin Garnett (33.93) 10. Wilt Chamberlain (33.43) 11. David Robinson (32.80) 12. Bill Russell (30.91) 13. Oscar Robertson (30.47) 14. Dirk Nowitzki (30.27 15. Larry Bird (30.14) 16. Jerry West (29.87) 17. John Havlicek (28.83) 18. Charles Barkley (28.80) 19. Bob Pettit (28.76) 20. Bob Cousy (28.38) 21. Magic Johnson (28.17) 22. Chris Paul 23. Kevin Durant 24. John Stockton 25. Moses Malone 26. Dolph Schayes 27. Gary Payton 28. Dwyane Wade 29. Scottie Pippen 30. Allen Iverson 31. Jason Kidd 32. Julius Erving 33. Elgin Baylor 34. Russell Westbrook 35. Dwight Howard 36. James Harden 37. Patrick Ewing 38. Steve Nash 39.

"LeBron James went # 1, how did that turn out?  What a weird response lol"
"The thing is, though, that if you're running your offense through Jimmy Butler, that means you're not running your offense through one of LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, or Luka Doncic--all of whom are better at running an offense than Jimmy.  You can make the argument for his defense, but if we're going to swap players in for that, paul george makes a lot more sense. At least he can actually shoot."

"And he brings up superhuman lebron James of course. Cant say I didnt see that one coming. Listen form definitely can help you but it's not the end all be all. Luck and genes also play a major factor in getting injured. Look at curry, everyone thought at the beginning of his career he would be injury prone. Do you think it would it have been good for Kerr to play him less because of this?? It seems like his ankles are fine now but should we have limited his minutes for the last several seasons because maybe he might get injured again??? It's just an idiotic take but again keep on shouting for nobody to hear you."
" LeBron James has been tampering since 2008 to form Superteams and has yet to be fined. The latest case is the AD to LA move, and whoever says otherwise is clearly blind. He also wanted to form, The Superteam, by having Kawhi and AD in his team."
If the bulls had Lebron James  playing for them they would beaten the cavs
"LeBron James reminds me of Pete Campbell, just the worst"
"Yes.  It matters to me because i kinda like parity.   See my example of if KD was traded instead of a free agency team up.   Heres another. Imagine if lebron wasnt a free agent and he got traded to miami. What would it take for the cavs to accept any offer for Lebron James? It has to include wade right? Otherwise other teams could probably offer packages better than any thing miami could offer. Boom. No team up between 2 top 5 players.    Also we are talking about ""team up"". Theres a vast difference between the trades celtics did to get KG/Allen. And the planned team up of bron and wade bosh"

"Almost like that time LeBron James took away his son's right to eat food, Kyrie Irving."
It was a lebron James and Kevin love joke. Didn’t think it was that obscure.
"It’s hard to really say since he’s played with so many All NBA level talents through his career.   I think Wade, Irving, and Davis are the top 3 contenders, but I lean towards Wade, because Wade was actually better than James in the 2011 NBA Finals, and I’m not sure there is any other teammate who can claim to being better than LeBron through a series or extended stretch."
"I'll eat those downvotes, but I disagree with this take.   TLDR: Small Market teams absolutely compete, just with smaller contention windows.  * There's 1 team that will always be attractive to free agents (Lakers)  * There's another few teams that will be attractive destinations as long as they're run well (Celtics, Knicks, Heat)  * There's another few teams that are in places that allow their contention window to maaaaybe be a little longer than other places (Bulls, Nets, Clippers, Warriors, Rockets, 76ers, Mavericks), but Warriors and Clippers were jokes.  * Then all the rest is a total grab bag (Magic landed Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady, Suns landed Steve Nash, Wizards landed Arenas, Spurs got Finley and Aldridge, Hawks got Mutombo, etc).   And that's not even counting that tons of home-grown stars actually stay in their cities for a significant part of their careers (Russell Westbrook, John Wall, Damian Lillard) and within the last 15 years (LeBron James, Kevin Love, Tim Duncan, Chris Webber, Jermaine O'Neal, Zach Randolph) all made $$$ on really small market teams."
"Lebron James has been in decline, fairly steadily, for at least the past four years."

"now take this question and apply it to lebron james, arguably the greatest player to ever live whose squat technique is hellish, rotting garbage. it’s baffling."
"So you’re out here more concerned about Lebron James than this kid getting shot, and then asking why Lebron has more to say on some topics than others?"
"Post reads “Lebron James...” look, I’m not trying to make the issue about Lebron but the post made it about him. Like I said I resonate with the sentiment and I want those dumbasses to be reprimanded at full cost and everyone that experience any type of racial, social, and all humanitarian injustices."
"Also, coincidental because Lebron also went to St. Mary's (high school), and played (and won championships) with  James Jones in Miami and Dellavedova in Cleveland."
"Yeah, I agree, I'm all for bettering statistical analysis but when you point to one guy as the reason for changing the formula (and correct me if I'm wrong but I dont recall anyone else mentioned though I wouldn't be surprised if Harden was) it seems on the surface as if your going out of your way to minimize a guys accomplishment rather than appreciate it  I know triple doubles apparently dont mean anything anymore but one of the crazier things thrown around was when people would say Lebron could avg a triple double easily if he wanted to, do people seriously think Lebron fucking James wouldn't want to be one of 3 people to avg a triple double for a season if it was that easy."
Lebron has been the biggest athlete in the world for over a decade...and Jordan Made that..lebron has been the successor. Everyone knows lebron. Have you ever said “lebron James” and had someone say “who?”
LeBron James' impact has made the NBA worse.
Unpopular opinion: LeBron James is the best player in his generation
"Oladipo healthy is probably the 2nd best player on a championship team so I’ll do this based on best fit versus who would pay the most.  Using his best season of 23 ppg/4astspg he was around where Ingram/Zach Lavine where this season (https://stats.nba.com/leaders/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=AST*GE*4:PTS*GE*23).  So narrowing down to teams that have an MVP candidate but not a 2nd star level player you’re left with Giannis, Luka, Trae Young, and Jokic (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2020/1/24/21079412/points-creation-giannis-antetokounmpo-luka-doncic-lebron-james).  Bucks (Giannis) - Outside of Donte Dinvicenso the Bucks don’t really have any more young talent worth trading for and even Donte is probably more of a role player. To make it happen they would probably need to move KMid to a team that needs a legit wing like the Kings or Wizards and only if their pick jumps to a top 3 pick for one Ball, Edwards, or Hayes. Trade that pick plus like one more first and a pick swap for Victor Oladipo.   Mavs (Luka) - Not really any more picks left so they would be trying to move KP for a high 1st rounder and another 1st rounder that would all then be sent to the Pacers for Oladipo.   Hawks (Trae) - Probably the most feasible and less crippling. If the Hawks jump in the lottery they could move that top 3 pick plus another and a wing (Huerter/Reddish) for Oladipo.  Nuggets (Jokic) - Probably Murray + MPJ + a Pick for Oladipo.   Pacers (Sabonis) - reading the article you can see that Sabonis has almost as much impact as Jokic, this is the most likely scenario to me. I think the Pacers really believe they have 2.5 stars between Oladipo, Brogdan, and Sabonis with great role players in Turner, Warren, Holiday, and maybe Lamb/Goga."
"Stephen Curry / DeAaron Fox  CJ McCollum / Lou Williams  LeBron James / Harrison Barnes  Nemanja Bjelica / Montrezl Harrell  Marvin Bagley / Javale McGee  That's 10 (my team is the Warriors, but I'm rolling Sonics flair until GoZ is over)"
"I would be younger LeBron James is right now, so it’s all good."
"What's this tweet going to change in this case in Georgia?  You think the people who suppressed the video evidence give a fuck what Lebron James thinks when they don't give a fuck about a cold-blooded murder that is literally their job to give a fuck about?  Did Lebron wearing an ""I Can't Breathe"" warmup shirt stop cops from murdering black men after Eric Garner?  He's sitting on half a billion dollars.  Motherfucker can take a small financial hit more than an Uyghur can take having both kidneys removed in unsanitary conditions without anesthesia."
"First, Jason Whitlock is a world class buffoon.  Second, you implied he wasn’t supporting people financially when you said:  &gt; Instead of supporting him maybe support the actual family or other victims of racism. He’s an attention whore and some people actually need help  The reality is he helps lots of people. That much his already known. The man opened a school, and does many public [donations ](https://www.blackeoejournal.com/2019/01/lebron-james-five-humongous-charitable-donations/) that we know about. He’s definitely not the guy who isn’t supporting others and issues he cares about financially."

LeBron James is clearly the GOAT  Curry is a playoff choker
"Let's use this.  I'll ask you a question.  Do you think if the police shot a white dude and it wasn't justified, do you think the police force would not try and protect their own?  I'm not denying that there are problems.   Look I fucking love LeBron James and I'm not saying he doesn't have a right to say whatever he wants.  I'm saying what he said is not true.  And coming from him that doesn't do anything besides create more division.  Approach it from a statistical perspective and put some weight behind it."
"OP did say  &gt; Lynching is a horrible thing and I cannot state that enough  So he agrees with Lebron on this one, but he is right to call him out on his other shit.  People are quick to forget about shit. Frankly, I don't give a damn what Lebron James thinks about this, even if he is right. Especially since he showed his true colors re the CCP and his pockets."
"Because Lebron ""Not James"" James' acting skills can barely be compared to the Koncussion Kid himself, James ""James"" Harden"
Luke Walton and LeBron James too
"What does that graph have to do with Lebron James specifically?  I'm not talking overall consensus, I'm specifically talking about Lebron's opinions."
"That’s because they’re older. When our parents are in nursing homes, they’re going to all know who lebron James is too.   Lebron is a household name, and a global icon. MJ is more famous of course because he’s been in American lexicon for almost 50 years now, but lebron will be the exact same way at that age."
"So you think LeBron James literally thinks that there's some Van Pelt style hunter after every single black person in America, waiting for them to step outside?"
Michael Jordan would of commented that racists buy sneakers too and stayed quite. This is why Lebron James is the GOAT.
They haven’t but that’s not the point. Your drawing false equivalencies to a global super star and your average person. The people of HK aren’t a single organism either. What do you want them to do? Sign a petition or something? If you can’t see the difference between the influence of HKers and LeBron James there’s no help.
Who is lebron james?
"Race is absolutely important in this case. However, that doesnt mean Lebron James is being hunted everytime he steps outside of his house.    He's hijacking sympathy for the deceased for attention, and should go fuck himself."
This is the first time I’ve ever seen “James” used to refer to Harden and not LeBron
Or lebron James lol
"You’re don’t know of any, huh? Pretty sure James harden‘s quote was „we love china, we love playing there.“ I don’t remember that backlash. Lillard said, „its unfortunate things have gotten to this point“ and curry said the same thing LeBron did „i don’t know enough about the topic.“ there ya go, there‘s 3. as got the us being 100 times better than China, that’s an exaggeration if I’ve ever heard one. Yeah, they are less free in China, and can’t criticize the government or free press, but people there still go to school, got to university, drive cars, and play video games. And, if people don’t like it there, when they get older, they can leave. Ironically this incident with armed vigilantes hunting this main wouldn’t happen there, and te us in general is much more violent than China. I think what is happening to the Uyghurs (which morey didn’t mention btw) is atrocious, but morey also failed to call out other nations, such as Myanmar and Israel, for similar behaviors. Why did you criticize LeBron for it and not morey? The truth is most of the people who are pissed at LeBron for criticizing morey would be criticizing morey of he made these comments about Israel and its relationship with Palestinians."
"Lebron ""I don't give a fuck about the chinese government putting innocent people in concentration camps"" James. Honestly, this is a tragedy, but Lebron is a businessman first, he's just posturing so ESPN, Reddit, etc. can talk about how Lebron tweeted his condolences and I'm sure he'll send some money. These dudes are murderers, can't believe it's even being debated by some but thinking Lebrons thoughts mean something is a huge leap considering the guy thought anyone against China was misinformed or not knowledgeable on that front."
"Lack of justice? I live 15min from east flatbush Brooklyn NY where black men get murdered every fucking month by other black men and there is no news, there is no justice and there damn sure ain't no LeBron James in the media talking about being hunted. Fuck you and fuck his fake caring ass."
"Nah, as LeBron said some problems aren't everyone's problem.  So, by his logic this is not my problem - or anybody's except African-Americans.  &amp;#x200B;  Congratulation on LeBron James reinventing himself as a social justice warrior again by reaching out at the lowest hanging fruit though."
And yet wasn't it LeBron James who also supported the Chinese suppression of Uighur muslims?
"There's a thing called Google. Here you go .  “We all do have freedom of speech, but at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others and you’re only thinking about yourself,” James said   https://www.wsj.com/articles/lebron-james-says-tweet-supporting-hong-kong-protests-was-misinformed-11571107697"
"Guy needs to eat and he's making millions overseas and saying how great China is and how amazing the government is when the whole Hong Kong story originally broke. He is just doing this for the money.  It's like if I was a huge anti oil advocate in Canadas arctic because of how it affects the environment,  local populations and wildlife. While at the same time hearing about the massive  spill in the Gulf of Mexico and mentioning how great a company British Petroleum is and how lucky everyone over at that coast is to have such an environmentally focused corporation in the region.  Meanwhile you're finding out BP is actually paying me under the tables massive endorsements to be at those arctic rallies and turns out it's a BP rival so its beneficial for them to do this.  This is all politics and if you're such a white knight for the well being of humanity then dont brush aside one of the largest genocides in the modern world while you get your assistant to make a""I Can't Breathe"" t-short over some cop killing a black male minding his own business.  Either you're in or you're not but what he is doing is clearly only beneficial for himself and when its convenient.  He is not a Martin Luther King. He is not a Princess Diana. He is just a kid from Akron Ohio and told what to do by professional PR suits when they see an easy opportunity to excel his image.  He is a copy written made up character who will donate back to Ohio but in the grand scheme of Lebron James, he will play ball for anyone willing to pay regardless if it's a tyrannical regime or not. Blood money or not.  Fuck him."
"Dude the murderers are literally sitting at home right now, chillin on their sofa, free as you or me. You ever think maybe THAT fact is what separates this incident get others?   And what really makes black Americans feel like it's ""them against the world"" is seeing the majority of the country bash them for daring to proclaim that their lives matter, care more about kneeling during the anthem at a sports game than their lives, consistently fail to provide justice for their killed loved ones, consistently provide excuses and assassinate the character of black victims, elect an obvious racist to the highest office, constantly barrage them with racist imagery and tropes in the media, etc, etc.   That is what creates a very fucking justified ""defensive mentality"". Not a statement by LeBron James. That's just a reflection of the anti-black attitudes expressed by way more than ""less than 1%"" of the rest of the population. What a joke."
"Don't hold your breath, LeBron ""I don't think every issue should be everyone's problem"" James only cares about human rights if it doesn't impact his pocket book. After his comments on Hong Kong and police killings there, he's the last one who should be opening his mouth."
"my father is a black man from brooklyn (pré-gentrification brooklyn) who worked his way into being the only member of his family who attended college &amp; has spent his life advocating for causes that both affect him directly &amp; affect others from different walks of life. he wants people to understand the struggles of his people so he makes an effort to try &amp; understand the struggles of others. i’m well acquainted with giving people the kind of courtesy that they probably wouldn’t give to me, especially because most people are ultimately self-absorbed  participating &amp; profiting from the commodification of humanitarian causes, whether financially or in public image means that one isn’t exempt from scrutiny if they do or say something stupid or ignorant. if you reap the benefits of something, the not so fun parts are also yours to deal with  pointing it out about someone like famous basketball player lebron james on a *basketball* subreddit does not mean i don’t feel similar sentiments about others who display similar hypocrisies, regardless of their race  it’s stupid when someone like zuckerberg does it &amp; it’s stupid when someone like lebron does it. he said &amp; did something really dumb &amp; it was during one of the biggest stories the nba’s been involved with, so he received global backlash. it is what it is"
"So LeBron ""I don't think every issue should be everyone's problem"" James only cares about human rights if it doesn't impact his pocket book? After his comments on Hong Kong and police killings there, he's the last one who should be opening his mouth."
Definitely not a stir the pot message from Luciferean Lebron James. Complete good intentions obviously.
"You're confusing LeBron James for the Chinese government, and grossly misrepresenting my argument. As a person subjugated by his own government, I will be the first to attest to the evil of such a regime—but LeBron James' participation in political life is the gray area we're talking about. I am contending that he is allowed to be portrayed as a just and sincere person, even if he did not participate in the China discussion. I am open to people disagreeing with me, but I think you've been pretty dishonest here. First is your implication that I brought up moral gray areas pertaining to China, when it was clearly about LeBron. Second is you conveniently ignoring the point about the ""I Promise"" School in refutation of your statement that LeBron doesn't do anything that would cost him money. Third is your repeated mention of LeBron ""disallowing"" players to speak their mind about China, which is also dishonest. He criticized Morey for being ""uneducated,"" and imho he was totally wrong. But honestly, bro, I'm not sure if you're here for a discussion or just for affirmation."
"&gt; It's using this man's tragedy to build a brand as more outspoken than Michael Jordan.  wat  Lebron has always spoke up on social issues, why would this be any different?

"Well yea because anyone can ""spread awareness"" it doesn't take any effort nor is it worthy of any praise   Yes I stand by that if you care about these types of things maybe u should plug urself more to social activists who focus on these things from the get-go because then u would've known about it instead of needing LeBron politician James to show u"
"lol c’mon quit lying. The original report clearly pointed at LeBron and it was common knowledge back then.  “Miller said he had been filming all day and had his tapes confiscated only after Crawford's dunk over James.  ""LeBron called Lynn over and told him something,"" Miller told CBSSports.com. ""That's how I knew his name was Lynn. LeBron said, 'Hey, Lynn. Come here.' ""  Minutes later, Miller said Merritt demanded his tape.  ""There's nothing I can think of besides LeBron just not wanting it online,"" Miller told CBSSports.com. ""It's a good story to tell people, I guess. But then again, I'm kind of pissed. I lost my tape.""  A spokesman for James said he had no comment.”"
I'm reading a LeBron James instagram post lmfao there's no story here chief just his thoughts. And it's always the same shit in these stories. Jumping to conclusions and assuming black man shot because black man exists with no critical thinking used. No one ever talks about when the cop is black. No one cares if the reason might not be racially motivated. Sensationalist always.
"2002 team is pretty damn stacked and balanced. I know the 2003 team gets more love, but having Kidd to run the offense instead of KG out there makes this team more well-rounded.  F: Tim Duncan   F: Tracy McGrady   C: Shaquille O'Neal   G: Kobe Bryant   G: Jason Kidd  Also, I know this is kinda cheating, but a revised version of the 2016 All-NBA teams would produce a really dominant lineup.  F: LeBron James  F: Kawhi Leonard  C: DeAndre Jordan ==&gt; Draymond Green  G: Stephen Curry  G: Russell Westbrook ==&gt; Kevin Durant  Draymond could knock down 3s that year and played DPOY level defense in the playoffs and regular season. I know people are going to clamor about Hakeem cooking him, but damn this lineup would be God-level small ball play."
The large majority of Kyrie’s points were scored in 1 on 1 isolation scenarios. Go back and watch the highlights. He was getting his own buckets more often than not.  “LeBron James made Kyrie score 41 points”. Like tf? If it was that easy for LeBron to make anybody play at Kyrie’s level then anyone would do it. Why was JR Smith not dropping Kyrie numbers? Why is Kuzma not averaging 25 ppg? At some point you gotta give credit to the player.
"I can appreciate that perspective. I just want to provide a bit of minutiae, as well, so, I would ask that you please indulge me.  Many of us here, of which I include myself, and Americans especially, are employed by companies and work in industries where our employers: pollute, discriminate, engage themselves in greedy practices, engage themselves in labor violations, lobby against our rights and deny us universal healthcare so that we remain beholden to our jobs, and generally do things that perhaps we, the employees don’t necessarily agree with. All the while, it’s very rare for us to stand up against corporations due to the labor unions falling out of favor and out of existence, and because we don’t want our income streams and and comfortable lives to be disrupted. And we don’t chastise each other, barring egregious circumstances, for whom we chose to work for.   I’m well aware that the analogue between those of us who are just trying to get by and LeBron fucking James is a massive delta to reconcile, but what I’m getting at is, how many of us could honestly say that were we in our position that we would not do the same thing *especially* if it was financially motivated?   LeBron is wealthy, many many times over. But he’s also a 35 year old black man, who, just 17 years ago was flat broke and his meal ticket was his incredible genetics, an unbelievable amount of luck and absolutely amazing work ethic. Do you think anyone would give two shits about LeBron had he torn his Achilles while he was a senior at SVSM and never turned into the man he is today? Many of us have great work ethics, but maybe not the intangibles that would elevate us into the next stratosphere or echelon of society. Tell me, then, besides the obvious humanitarian issue (seriously, fuck PRC) why should we criticize LeBron for looking out for his financial best interests?  America, and the world writ large has been so awful to people with dark skin. We were brought here not by our own choice, but stolen from places that we don’t even know or understand. Black people don’t have a “home” like many other people who are immigrants in the US. Moreover, the country was predominantly built on the backs of our ancestors who tended to many of the properties and estates of people who *kept* and *treated* them as if they were themselves property. Families were broken up as slaves we traded and blacks had to conceal the fact that they were intellectuals for fear of being lynched by mobs of white men. When blacks were finally freed under the Emancipation Proclamation, my ancestors were promised retribution for slavery in the form of land which they, too, would be able to accumulate wealth, such as their non-black contemporaries. Of course, that never happened, and, thus, over long period of time and a lot of heartache, struggle and oppression, that prejudice kept us poor and almost indistinguishable from the position that we were in before. Think I’m being hyperbolic, look at the number and ratio of blacks who are incarcerated, many for low level drug offenses during the Reagan and Clinton administrations due to the War on Drugs.   Black men were absent en masse in their children’s lives for possession of drugs like crack and marijuana and ended receiving life sentences. It’s quite possible that due to the fact that the WoD was only 30 or so years ago, that it actually had a direct impact on LeBrons upbringing. I have no evidence for that, but as a black man who had family, men especially, who spent a lot of time in jail for drug offenses, they weren’t able to build relationships with their child. It’s hard for a mother to raise a child on their own, much less a man.  We’re in 2020, we’re under a lockdown due to a pandemic. White men with assault rifles have stormed the governors office demanding to be “liberated” as our president tweeted his recommendation to demand the states to reopen forcibly. He called these demonstrators “fine people” and implored the Gov to “make a deal with them”. Men who are flying confederate flags and Nazi flags. You know what he called Kaep for kneeling? A “son of a bitch”. If you think that there’s not an element of racism, just ask yourself if you think the country would be okay with a troop of black men storming the White House with AR-15s.  Also, if you think I’m bullshitting about the world being hard on people with dark skin, look at what happened to the Native Americans; look at how Brazilians (today) deny and reject the fact that they are ancestorally of African descent. Look in India and the Philippines where women bleach their skin with products that contain mercury to make themselves appear more fare skinned. These women may very well birth children who are developmentally disabled due to mercury poisoning.  So, what I’m getting at is, LeBron, like many of us black people, never had the chance to attain the generational wealth that non-black Americans have enjoyed. Further, even with his stature and platform, LeBron isn’t even among the wealthiest people in America! There are about 4 black billionaires: MJ, Oprah, BET founder and the gentlemen who worked for a fiduciary company who paid for the tuition of all those kids at the HBCU last year. You think Gates, Zuckerberg, Sergei and Larry, Ballmer, Buffett, Bezos, Musk, et al. aren’t cozying up to the Chinese, too? LeBron, very well may be ignorant about what has been transpiring in China. But he is not wrong to take care of his pockets, not if we all don’t hold other, non-athletes who have *real* power to the same accord and expectations.  TLDR, LeBron is getting his bread because America has historically denied black men and women from getting theirs. And I can’t say that I blame him, and neither can you if you’re not willing to hold everyone, not just LeBron to the same standards."
"If you would like to go through growing pains again, the New Orleans Pelicans are in a great spot going forward. They have one of the most hyped prospects in recent memory (Zion Williamson) and a solid core around him. Lonzo Ball is the fucking man (and perhaps you're familiar with his brother LaMelo who played in Australia). They're pretty exciting imo, and are on the cusp of making the playoffs  If you want to root for a powerhouse, in my completely biased opinion you should follow the Lakers. Or the Bucks. But I say the Lakers.  We have Lebron James, the greatest player of this generation. The man is heading into his late 30s and is still arguably the best player in the league. Anthony Davis is another top-5 level player, and will make you fall in love with defense. Our biggest strength, if you're the type of fan who appreciates digging into the lore of the game, is our history. There's loads of classic Laker games on YouTube, and more often than not a Laker classic is an era-defining NBA-wide classic.  Honorable mentions to:  * The Dallas Mavericks. Luka Doncic is one in a million and the sooner you get on board the better.  * The Philadelphia 76ers. You will get shitted on, clowned, hated, etc. But it will be worth it for the brotherhood, the fuck the world mentality, and the incredible young talent of Ben Simmons (Aussie) and Joel Embiid."
yikes.  Ali was without a doubt THE most recognizable athlete during his day. People knew who he was from Zaire to New Zealand. And this was in the 60s.  Ali had major impact in anything he did. The man literally gave up his career for what he believed in.  LeBron James only speaking up about American problems is a good way to only have an impact in America.  He could have a bigger impact but it'd cost him money :(
"[I think its a reference to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfgT4uEGc2w)  &gt;Jordan Crawford dunking on LeBron James during a pickup game at the LeBron James Skills Academy in Akron, OH. Nike confiscated the tape  That's Joe's brother, btw"

"Westbrook’s MVP is a testament to the league’s distain for james harden. WB had a sort of athletic peak I would say as a player; but his game was highly inefficient and it was proven in the playoffs after Durant left.   I would say the lock are these: Lebron Curry Harden CP3 Kawhi KD   Once you get those people, you go by individual metrics with on-off/RPM/RAPM/PIPM/etc. You get those stats. Then you make a conclusion: CP3 is top 5 here. Then you look at the PS and he is also a relative+ on TS% and impact. The narrative is he is a choker. He has had two bad series in my opinion. I’m not sure that warrants much about himself rather his team."
"Some names i havent seen for overrated already would be john stockton, he gets more reward for playing for a long time than anyone ive ever seen. KG should be viewed neck and neck with tim duncan but timmy gets the nod for being drafted to a better situation  Underrated: James Worthy, he was basically a number 1 option masquerading as a 3rd or 4th option, joe dumars, clyde drexler, probably amare stoudemire doesnt even get a quarter of the respect for those pheonix suns . I feel like people look at it like a lebron kevin love situation where one player was much better than the other when it was more like shaq and kobe situation. theres probably a semi argument u can make that he might have even been the best player on the team. probably a weak argument, but it wouldnt be completely ridiculous"
hahahahaha lol  I don't even like Lebron James and this post made me chuckle  So let me ask you this   who's better between Larry and Kobe Bryant?
"Let's not revise history and act like what LeBron commented wasn't confusing.   www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27847951/daryl-morey-was-misinformed-sending-tweet-china-hong-kong  &gt;""I don't want to get into a [verbal] feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke,"" James said before the Los Angeles Lakers played the Golden State Warriors in a preseason game at Staples Center. ""And so many people could have been harmed not only financially, physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and say and we do, even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.""  &gt;When asked why he thinks Morey wasn't properly informed about the unrest in Hong Kong before he tweeted support for protesters, James said it is ""just my belief.""  &gt;""I believe he was either misinformed or not really educated on the situation, and if he was, then so be it,"" James said. ""I have no idea, but that is just my belief. Because when you say things or do things, if you are doing it and you know the people that can be affected by it and the families and individuals and everyone that can be affected by it, sometimes things can be changed as well. And also social media is not always the proper way to go about things as well, but that's just my belief.""  &gt;Soon after speaking with reporters, James took to social media to ""clear up the confusion.""  &gt;""I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I'm not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that,"" James said in a tweet.  &gt;""My team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it,"" James added in a second tweet.  Let's not forget, China has been torturing protestors for months. Let's not change history. LeBron still hasn't cleared up his statements. Presumably, they still are his beliefs."
"""These players helped build their organization""   Did anyone care about Cleveland before LeBron James?"
"Bro did you even read my comment?  &gt;There’s never been a guy who can defend positions 1 to 5 before Lebron James? Are you serious lol  Never said 1-5. I said 1-4.  &gt; So he’s the best defender of all time now &amp; apparently the only person in NBA history capable of guarding 1-5. The only versatile defender in NBA history  Please show me where I said LeBron is the best defender of all time. I said LeBron is unique in that he is elite on BOTH offense and defense between 1-4. Maybe LeBron isn’t “elite” at every single one of those spots on defense but he’s damn near close when he’s locked in.  &gt; I would’ve loved to see LBJ guard Shaq lmao  Being an elite defender does not necessarily mean you can lock down generationally dominant offensive players. Just because LeBron can excel at guarding the 2 doesn’t mean he would’ve put the clamps on prime MJ. Shaq is irrelevant anyway because of my first point.  You completely missed the point I was making. You know, the point that LeBron is great in part because of how versatile he is on both sides of the ball. But you seem to spend a lot of your time trashing bron in this sub so I shouldn’t be surprised. And then still complain about “this sub”. Cool bro"
"JJ is good at drawing offensive fouls. That's true. It's also true that people still back him down and score on him all the time. And most of those people aren't LeBron James. People want to make excuses for LeBron, and I get it. We all make excuses for our favorite player's failures. People don't say that LeBron failed because of JJ, they say that him refusing to punish that mismatch is a prominent display of his failure. And it is. There is no world in which JJ Barea (as much as I respect his game) should be able to stop LeBron one on one, and yet in the most important series of his life (to that point), LeBron let it happen.  Also, JJ is still playing in the league...."
"LeBron stans want their moment. They've been inundated with Jordan posts since The Last Dance first aired and are probably sick of it. What they don't realise is that public/player opinion on the goat is very, very heavily in favour of Jordan, like overwhelmingly so. It would be called the greatest landslide in history if it were a Presidential election. Then add to that the fact that Jordan leads LeBron in almost every statistical category, most importantly advanced metrics, and you realise that one person is quite clearly the *better player*. That person is not LeBron James. Some people are just too stubborn or stupid to recognise that fact. It's really amazing how easy it is for Jordan fans to argue in his favour while it's equally amazing to see the mental gymnastics that LeBron fans perform to try and build an argument in LBJ's favour."
"I hate to say this, but, am I the only person who could literally give a shit less about LeBron James? He was womanizer and an all around duchebag in my opinion. He was a good father, that's about it."
"I see their careers as inverses of each other so they're fortunes of being surrounded by great players  is a wash in totality. Magic is fortunate to come in with Kareem. But Kareem is past his prime by the mid 80s, which coincided with Magic's 5/6th year. Also gotta remember tho, James Worthy is Hall of Famer in large part due to Magic. So as his teammates aged and no top talent was added in his later career, he was still able to carry a B level team to the finals, which u saw against Michael's Bulls.   We can run thru LeBron's super teams in Miami, Cavs(second go around), and now Lakers but I think we both know his story. So to your point, if you're going to praise LeBron for dragging mediocre teams early in his career to the finals, then u cannot dismiss what Magic has done in his later career with the same mediocre level of talent. If you're penalize Magic for being fortunate in coming into the league with all world talent already in place, then we're going to have to do the same for LeBron jumping ship to form powerhouses and taking shortcuts in his later  career. U see how that works now. So if we take out these narratives and just take their careers for face value, who has more accomplishments?.. That's why I got Magic ahead. Just slightly tho."
"&gt; You can slot LeBron in any position from 1-4 and he can play there at an elite level. Not just good or great, elite. He can be top 5 or better in the league at any of those positions at will. He can also defend each and every one of those positions at equally elite levels.  &gt; I don’t think that can be said of any other player ever. LeBron is the ultimate renaissance man of basketball.  There’s never been a guy who can defend positions 1 to 5 before Lebron James? Are you serious lol  So he’s the best defender of all time now &amp; apparently the only person in NBA history capable of guarding 1-5. The only versatile defender in NBA history   I would’ve loved to see LBJ guard Shaq lmao  This sub... smh. Cmon y’all."
Jordan and Kobe were insanely popular here in Europe. Many people never even heard of LeBron James but everybody knows MJ and Kobe.
"I think you’re missing my point. When I said isolate the variables I was referring to the only factor changing between Player A and Player B being their non championship season outcomes. That way we can get a clear look at whether we think playoff wins, and conference championships matter in legacy.  There are basically 3 opinions when evaluating finals records and their impact on player legacy:  Opinion 1) LeBron James is 3-6 in finals therefore he has a worse legacy than someone who has 3-0 record. In this common opinion the person believes losing in the finals tarnishes your legacy and LeBron would have been better off losing in earlier rounds.  Opinion 2) LeBron James has 3 finals wins in 16 seasons. This is equal to someone who is 3-0 in NBA Finals. This was OP’s opinion on how we should judge finals towards a players legacy.  Opinion 3) LeBron hames has been to 9 finals and won 3. In this opinion it is more impressive that he reached the finals rather than being knocked out in early playoffs or not making the playoffs at all.  You’re arguing a bit in bad faith assuming that the reason I hold an opinion is to benefit the legacy of a player. Is it not possible that I think that’s just the right method?"
"Who would win a cock fight ? Michael Jordan or Lebron James.   Well Skip, I have seen michael in the show and man does he pack a monster. Not to day lebron james has a tiny weiner. But MJ has some monster schlong."
"&gt; Ok, but shouldn't longevity have some part in the discussion?  Not really, longevity should be used to shut down concerns of a player benefitting from a specific situation, if both players have 10+ years and success in multiple situations bringing up longevity is weak. To me using longevity for Lebron James is insulting him."
I'd take Prime Wilt Chamberlain over Prime Lebron James. Don't @ me.
"We are. the argument is ""what lebron James can physically do on the court is more unique and valuable than what MJ did despite Jordan having a better, more successful career."" Its not that difficult. Like there are almost certainly dudes who can play the guitar in a way that is technically more impressive than what Jimi Hendrix did. That's no longer potential those dudes can physically do it better. But the combination of expectations and circumstances surrounding Jimi's rise and fall were so spectacular it makes it difficult to argue anybody is ""greater"" regardless of the talent disparity. That's Jordan."
"Why are you so defensive bro? Salty because you know those championships were a joke? Congratulations on getting taken to 6 by the big three of LeBron/Dellavedova/Mozgov, besting a non-playoff Spurs team in the 2017 WCF, and overcoming James Harden and role players in Games 6 and 7 in 2018. Incredible run.  Excited to defend the next bullshit run against opponents without their best or second best player and then pretend that it was a great feat?   Any elite core would win multiple championships if their best opponents were crippled year in and year out. LMAO. Two MVPs and two All-NBA players were down by double digits at halftime to James Harden and role players in Games 6 and 7. What a joke LOL."
"&gt; Ehh, I understand the idea of trying to add context, but IMO the NBA is so different now vs then that contextualizing the differences is almost certain to end up factoring in some things and ignoring others, so it's a faulty context.  So why even have a GOAT? It would make more sense to have GOATs of 10-20 year eras.   &gt; The amount of difference in contact rules alone makes it almost impossible to say how MJ would play now or James would play then, so at some point you just have to accept that what happened happened and run with the facts.  That's more of an individual based comparison that doesn't factor into this macro level discussion. Like, i'm not trying to argue how well LeBron would do against handchecks.    &gt; s far as the nice guy thing goes, I don't think you have to be mean to be the best, I think you have to be the best to be the best. If you make sure to include your friends on the team at the cost of having a less competitive squad, then you aren't going to be as good as you potentially can be, and it's extremely hard to be the greatest of all time if you aren't even giving yourself the best chance at winning.  Agreed, but in this context, LeBrons goal was to have the most competitive team which he achieved. It's not like he got his banana boat best friends contracts just to shoot the shit.    &gt; He pushed the Cavs to pay JR Smith, and then shortly after Smith's airhead move took the wind out of the sails at a pivotal point in the Finals. Is that 100% James' fault? No. Would they have won the series without that happening? Maybe not. Did James insisting on Smith getting a contract have an effect on the future of the team? Hell yes it did.  I don't understand the point. He pushed for JR, and JR ended up being a pivotal player for 3 years, hitting numerous clutch shots. By all means, he earned his keep there. One extremely dumb move on his part does not mean that LeBron retroactively lacked competitive intent when he advocated for him to join. C'mon lol  &gt; Even if Wade being injured does affect that last year, it still doesn't change the fact that the Heat only went 2/3 before then. It doesn't change the fact that Lebron hasn't 3peated when MJ and the Bulls did it twice.  Agreed, I haven't said otherwise."
"He’s a terrific role player but he is, as shown with the Cavs, a number 4 or 5 player on a championship team. He was flashy but in big moments he failed as a key contributor (2013 playoffs, his whole 2015 Knicks year). As his career evolved he became a 3 point sniper so that’s why he was able to fit so well with LeBron James but his prime years he was best as a sixth man and come drop 16-18 off the bench in 25-28 minutes."
"Ehh, I understand the idea of trying to add context, but IMO the NBA is so different now vs then that contextualizing the differences is almost certain to end up factoring in some things and ignoring others, so it's a faulty context.

If you make sure to include your friends on the team at the cost of having a less competitive squad, then you aren't going to be as good as you potentially can be, and it's extremely hard to be the greatest of all time if you aren't even giving yourself the best chance at winning.   He pushed the Cavs to pay JR Smith, and then shortly after Smith's airhead move took the wind out of the sails at a pivotal point in the Finals. Is that 100% James' fault? No. Would they have won the series without that happening? Maybe not. Did James insisting on Smith getting a contract have an effect on the future of the team? Hell yes it did.   Even if Wade being injured does affect that last year, it still doesn't change the fact that the Heat only went 2/3 before then. It doesn't change the fact that Lebron hasn't 3peated when MJ and the Bulls did it twice."
This guy just compared LeBron James to Jesus Christ and MLK?
"&gt; Again, like I mentioned before, arguments against MJ always come down to ""If reality was different""... which I think is a copout  Ah, I see what you're saying but I don't agree with your interpretation of those arguments. To me, they aren't hypotheticals, they're just contextual arguments. You have to take all these arguments into context, and argue within different contextual spaces, by default of these generational debates. If you don't, then it's impossible to really say anyone is GOAT across eras. So, in this instance, i'm not so much saying ""if reality was different..."", i'm saying appreciate the context of those series in relation to Michael Jordan.    &gt; So he had better support but still only won 2/3, 2/4 total with the Heat if you take away the justification about Wade (again, if only reality was different).  And it's the same here. I'm not saying ""if reality was different"", i'm saying Dwade was on a sharp decline, so compared to the way Scottie was able to stay healthy and durable during the championship runs, Dwade was only comparable to Scottie for 3 years.   So....you can't be GOAT if you're nice? If Jordan had done all that, but was also a nice guy, he couldn't be GOAT? I honestly don't get it. For example, Gretsky was a nice enough guy by all accounts, and has a more concrete GOAT argument in hockey than Jordan has in Basketball. Is he not a great competitor?   &gt;  But he strong-armed management and affected the team that he shared the court with, and doing so makes the team overall less competitive. You want to be the greatest? You better win above all else.  He never negatively affected these teams (while he was there), and has always been a great locker room presence. If you're talking about the contracts he got his friends in Cleveland, then you have to appreciate the context behind it. He spent 7-8 years in Cleveland under horrible management that was never good enough to put a team around him and still aren't now. Why would he trust them? We got a quick throwback glimpse of how shitty they were in '18 when the Cavs got fleeced by the Celtics. LeBron playing GM is how he made the Cav's a legit strong team in 15-17, and they likely would have three-peated if not for injuries/KD. So, to me, that speaks to him doing anything he could to win. I honestly don't see how you conclude that he was just concerned with getting his friends money.    &gt; Yet you justified James' losses by saying ""hacks"" and ""D-Wade was basically on crutches"" - sounds a lot like you're giving him credit based on a hypothetical world that doesn't exist.  Those aren't hypotheticals, they're contextual arguments like I mentioned before. A hypothetical would be me basing my argument on...hypotheticals. There's nothing hypothetical about me saying that KD joining the Warriors destroyed parity to the point that the season was done before it even started, and then using that point to explain why ""3-6"" isn't as detrimental as it seems. There's nothing hypothetical about bringing up Dwades injuries when comparing him to Scottie Pippen."

"How good a player is right now has nothing to do with the GOAT debate though. You're trying to talk about something that's completely irrelevant. You don't talk about the GOAT in terms of ""I wonder what he'll do"" it's 100% supposed to be about what he did.   Mahomes is just the new hot flavor. His 2018 wasn't even better than Rodgers 2011, let alone as good as other historically great seasons. But because he's fresh and people are being wowed by him making no-look passed and throwing bombs to a wide open Tyreek Hill he's the guy they want to proclaim the GOAT already - 2 years into his career.   That's not how GOAT works. Lebron James entire GOAT argument is based on what people think he could have done, not about what he actually did. That's why it's so obvious that he's not the GOAT - it's never about what he did it's about other stuff. The more complex and the more excuses a player has in the GOAT debate the more obvious it is that they aren't the GOAT.   Jordan's claim to GOAT is simple. 6 rings, amazing stats, always brought his game to a playoff series. Brady's claim to GOAT is simple. 6 rings, 9 appearances, amazing stats, always brought his game to the playoffs (though single elim NFL makes it harder to show consistent greatness since no series, 1 bad game and it can end).  Lebron's claim isn't simple, and that's why the answer is simple. Trying to call him the BOAT is essentially meaningless as it's just a way to dance around the subject."
"&gt; They won in '16, and '17 doesn't count because of hacks  Again, like I mentioned before, arguments against MJ always come down to ""If reality was different""... which I think is a copout  &gt;Bosh + Wade is better than Pippen, but we only had that full strength line up 3 times  So he had better support but still only won 2/3, 2/4 total with the Heat if you take away the justification about Wade (again, if only reality was different).  &gt; Seriously, why is LeBron docked GOAT points for making sure his friends get paid? Lol  For me personally? GOAT means greatest competitor. As far as life goes, it's great to value your friends over basketball. But he strong-armed management and affected the team that he shared the court with, and doing so makes the team overall less competitive. You want to be the greatest? You better win above all else.   &gt; People don't need to rely on hypotheticals to debate against MJ being GOAT  Yet you justified James' losses by saying ""hacks"" and ""D-Wade was basically on crutches"" - sounds a lot like you're giving him credit based on a hypothetical world that doesn't exist."
"It's really easy to misinterpret things when comparing finals series record, because a high number in the loss column actually means a team/player was *good*. Maybe the way we should look at is as percentage of a career. Just have to decide if certain years ""count"". If we don't have a playoffs this year 100% doesn't count for LeBron.  Injuries are trickier. Jordan missed most of 85-86, but it doesn't seem like that team was very likely to go far anyway. Similar story for LeBron last year.  In this case, I think only excluding this year (also because playoffs still haven't happened anyway) is fair. So the numbers:  Jordan: went to finals 40% of his seasons, won the finals 40% of his seasons  James: went to finals 56% of his seasons, won the finals 19% of his seasons  It doesn't settle any debates, but it's a much better set of numbers to compare with. Still ignores the fact (as any rings centered argument does) of supporting cast. Obviously there were early Cavs teams for LeBron that weren't going to do anything big and Jordan has years like that too."
"Enjoy this copy pasta from homecourtloss on the RealGM forums my brother   LeBron 2016 Finals Defense copypasta   LeBron’s defense alone in those playoffs/Finals are noteworthy. Combine that with his offense and it’s the greatest of all time Finals performance.   Sideshow had an RPM estimate of +8 to +9 on offense and +5 to +6 on defense. That’s a +15 player and that’s bonkers. It’s like one of the crazy “How good would Magic Pippen” or “How good would Hakeem Curry” creations come to life.  LeBron’s defense In the playoffs was ridiculous:  Overall: 31.9 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 45.9%, -14.0% Threes: 24.1 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 36.7%, -12. 6% Twos: 36.6 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 50.5%, -13.9% &lt;6ft: 37.9 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 61.3%, -23.5%  LeBron In the finals was utterly ridiculous:  Overall: 31.6 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 47.9%, -16.3% Threes: 29.0 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 39.6%, -10.6% Twos: 33.3 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 53.6%, -20.3% &lt;6ft: 38.5 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 63.6%, -25.1%  LeBron In the finals’ last three games was I don’t know what:  Overall: 19.4 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 47.4, -28.4% Threes: 12.5 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 40.7%, -28.2% Twos: 25 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 52.4%, -27.4% &lt;6ft: 15.4 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 60.6%, -45.2  This was game 5 defense ‪https://stats.nba.com/player/2544/defense-dash/?Season=2015-16&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;DateTo=06%2F13%2F2016&amp;DateFrom=06%2F13%2F2016&amp;PORound=4‬  This was game 6 defense ‪https://stats.nba.com/player/2544/defense-dash/?Season=2015-16&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;DateTo=06%2F16%2F2016&amp;DateFrom=06%2F16%2F2016&amp;PORound=4‬  The Warriors shot 4 for 28 overall (3/17 in game 5, 1/11 in game 6) in those two games (14.3%) when going against LeBron and that doesn’t include his team defense, defensive rebounding, rotations, etc,   The Warriors shot 2/13 AT THE RIM against LeBron during the final three games. Had James not stopped those shots (everyone knows the blocked shot on Iggy), Warriors win.   The guy not only led them in scoring and creating offense for others, he led their perimeter defense AND was one of the best rim protectors in the 2016 NBA playoffs."
"Lebron has spent 95% of his career guarding his position. So i guess being switchable 5% of the time is a great defensive plus but jordan was a better individual defender and was always on the prowl because on that end because of his intensity and basketball iq. Its not really close tbh, are we forgetting lebrons cavs were often the worst defensive team in the league? The bulls were never even close to that and were contrary usually one of the best defensive teams in the league.  Offense =/= ppg, he’s right. But jordan is the most lethal scorer in history. Think james harden level of efficiency but with kawhi leonard defence on the other end. All time players are all so supremely skilled, and the difference between their skill levels arent really that high. But when it comes down to it, mixing kawhis defence with hardens proficiency at scoring creates the best player in todays league lol. Thats what it just comes down to for me. Jordan plays a style of ball that has proven to be the most effective over time."
If anything this documentary will just solidify him as the greatest player ever until The Second Last Dance airs about LeBron James in 30 years
"The problem I have with this argument is that if you acknowledge LeBron James is a better basketball player than Jordan, but claim Jordan's accomplishments (winning 6 titles) make him ""the greatest"", then really the two players you should be discussing are LeBron James and Bill Russell and cut out MJ entirely.  There's never been a better basketball player than LeBron.  There will never be a player who wins 11 championships in 13 years like Russell.  That's your BOAT and GOAT."
"I think there's a massive difference between saying LeTrash and: LeBron is not objectively better than Michael Jordan. Which is the take of a *lot* of people on this sub, they just aren't *as* vocal right now because the Jordan doc just aired. But if we get basketball back, on the first series win by James that LeBron=Goat talk will heat up."
"The problem I have with this argument is that if you acknowledge LeBron James is a better basketball player than Jordan, but claim Jordan's accomplishments (winning 6 titles) make him ""the greatest"", then really the two players you should be discussing are LeBron James and Bill Russell and cut out MJ entirely.  There's never been a better basketball player than LeBron.  There will never be a player who wins 11 championships in 13 years like Russell.  That's your BOAT and GOAT."
"Lebron James is quite literally the greatest of all time. Michael Jordan, is literally the best there ever was."
"Lebron would’ve started losing to James Harden, Kawhi, KD or someone else from the west if Steph and the Warriors didn’t exist. The best teams in the east the past 8 years Lebron played were led by Demar Derozan and Al Horfod. You have to wipe away the western conference."
"I'm not totally convinced that Lebron Jordan is the way to go. People will kill me for this but I dont think merging those 2 players improves on either one much.   For the longest time it was acknowledged that even though Lebron got his in a different way that he was pretty much as unstoppable from scoring as Jordan was (when he attempted to) and so the biggest criticism on him was his willingness or preference to pass the ball. Remove that theoretical weakness from James game and you have something that looks an awful lot like the guy you are merging him with. Same goes for Jordan - make him more of a passer and you are giving the GOAT what basketball fans consider a weakness in their all-time greats.  Defensively obviously Jordan adds plenty to James though.  But Magic Bird takes 2 top 10 players all-time with very different attributes, I just feel like the upside is greater because of that."
"This is the correct answer. Dan Gilbert was fresh off losing Lebron James to Miami recently and was infamously salty/childish about the whole ordeal.  He couldn’t stand that the Lakers, possibly the biggest market team in the league, were coming up big in a blockbuster trade while he looked like the loser holding the sh!t end of the stick for his tiny market team."
"I literally have no idea where you come up with   &gt;""he has the advantage in no stats advanced or regular bar assists""  [It's so easy to put their stats against each other and see that isn't true.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_select=Michael+Jordan&amp;y1=2003&amp;player_id1=jordami01&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;player_id2_select=LeBron+James&amp;y2=2020&amp;player_id2=jamesle01&amp;idx=bbr__players)  If you like counting stats, per game LeBron has advantages in rebounds and assists, Jordan has points and steals, and they're tied on blocks.  If you like shooting efficiency LeBron has advantages in 3P%, 2P%, and eFG% while Jordan has the edge in FT%.  If you like totals, LeBron has more points, blocks, assists, rebounds, and basically every other metric other than steals. Jordan also has fewer turnovers.  If you like advanced stats LeBron leads in TS%, RB%, AST%, BLK%, OWS, DWS, WS, and VORP. Jordan has PER, STL%, lower TOV%, USG%, WS/48, OBPM, DBPM, and total BPM.  It's fine if you think Jordan is the GOAT, I probably do too, but to say LeBron has no argument is insane to me, and claiming he has no statistical argument is just factually incorrect."
"lebron obviously has a winning mentality and he has one of the greatest come up from nothing stories of all time in sports, not to mention having to deal with the first wave of social media. he revolutionized the idea that an athlete controls his own destiny as well and that's one thing he has over every other player and i have a great admiration for the balls it took to leave cleveland. he's legitimately one of the most impressive athletes in my lifetime. the problem with lebron defenders is that they look at any criticism of his mentality on the court as someone saying that he's mentally weak compared to regular people which is not what anyone is saying. lebron is comfortably a top 5 player which means he is being compared to the BEST of the BEST mentally. and the best is jordan and hes better than lebron who has shown in the finals that he can come up short when all logic says he should not. his defenders hate when people bring up 2011 but thats a black mark on him forever when debating who the BEST EVER is. were not talking about him vs some scrub were talking about James vs. the GOAT so the scrutiny has to be intense. Plus Jordan had the decency to admit his age and shave his head clean.    as for the scoring stuff, yeah lebron can score in all those ways as well no one is debating lebrons scoring, but jordan was BETTER at it, hence more skilled. and youre just making excuses for his defense so no need to address that."
"I have to disagree. One refers to pure ability to perform. Talent + skill + intangibles. Greatness is more about Legacy. Theoretically they go hand in hand but in the real world organisation, team and off court issues make the difference. I have Lebron as the better player but Micheal was on the perfect team at a perfect time, which made him legendary. Even external factors play a part like 80s and 90s icon are just more legendary because it was a new era of commercialism and media wasnt saturated like today, making the greats like Mike Jackson and MJ seem like they were television characters   Muhammad Ali isnt hands down the best boxer ever, thats arguable. But hes definitely the greatest from a legacy standpoint. I think thats what Lebron realised after 2016 and stopped trying to prove his excellence, but instead add to his legacy and the mystique of Lebron James. We wont see it but the kids of tomorrow will."
I didn’t know lebron James had won DPOY
"Yeah, no. I'm not going to automatically bet that LeBron James is a ""monster behind closed doors"" when there's zero evidence to support that assertion, and plenty to the contrary."
"Dude he's really trying to paint Larry Hughes as good in this post by citing his stats from 2 years ago. He averaged 15 a game on horrendous efficiency. He was a huge chucker.   The premise is partially correct, the cavs were a defensive minded team with a superstar offensive engine. They get the iverson ""carry"" narrative because people ignore defense, but the reality is they did suck pretty bad outside of James. They didn't really have anyone even close to above average on the team outside of lebron. Z and gooden were average starters, Hughes was legitimately a huge negative, and the rest were just average bench players.  Then he says the carry job has been done by wade and jkidd. Jkidd played with other good players in Jefferson, Martin, and Kerry kittles. Wade played with a still all star level shaq. Iverson is really the closest example, a defensive minded team with a lone offensive super star. Even tho those sixers teams were even better defensively than the cavs were"

"Which makes sense.   Besides, this entire argument is subjective.  From my perspective, LeBron James is the best basketball I have ever seen."
"It's the sort of argument that only matters if you're directly comparing LeBron James and Michael Jordan.  If you're doing that, well, Jordan was a glitch in the Matrix. That's all there is to it. There will never be anyone like Mike.  Considering how,  hm, hot-take heavy people tend to get about these things and how unhinged people can get to sounding when they talk about LeBron James generally... I always found the implicit concession that yeah LeBron's the second-best player ever to be amusing."
imagine being this triggered by people complimenting Lebron James in r/nba
"The Bulls were a super team because of Jordan, in raw talent they were not that much better than their opponents if you just look at the second options   Bad Boy Pistons  Dumars vs Pippen is close  1991 Lakers  Worthy Divac and Ac Green is about as good as Pippen and Grant  1992 Blazers  I don’t know enough about this team to argue  1993 Suns Both Kevin Johnson and Dan Majerle were all stars with KJ being All Nba   1996 Sonics Shawn Kemp is all nba and Detlef is an all star not dissimilar to what the bulls had  1997/1998 The Jazz had the second third and fifth best players on the court in Malone, Stockton, and Hornacek  Jordan is what made those bulls superteams  This isn’t even really doing a deep dive into who he beat in the East  Again this article is really good https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/michael-jordan-faced-better-competition-than-lebron-james/amp/"
"This is what I was thinking, kind of a poor mans Lebron James. I don’t think the Igudola comparison is a particularly good one because Pippen was essentially the first “point forward” who you could run your offense through and that’s never really been Iggy."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"PART 2  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;**I think this era, lacking the hand-checking, would handi-cap the intensity of Jordan's elite defense. I'll go so far as to say it would compromise his impact on the game in clutch situations; not being able to impose the full extent of his physical will because of the way the game is now played.** So maybe Jordan averages 50 in this era, but his opponent would be right behind him with 38.  On the flip side, no question about it, I see Lebron James flourishing in the '90s. His size, speed, and ability to make contact on smaller guards, it'll be like lambs to the slaughter.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;He would probably never have to use a spin move because you just got away with more offensive fouls on the drive in that era. And if you needed to, you could issue a brutal offensive foul or two to let the defender know **""move when you see the freight train coming"",  no flagrant foul call.** Knowing the cerebral player that he is in this era, I see him **exploiting the rule to dominate.** After all, he's **built for it;** r**unner-up for defensive player of the year, 6x all-defensive first team, while handicapped by the way the game is played today.** **Three (3) Sustained Greatness:** LeBron has sustained the highest level of play over the longest career stretch in the NBA today.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; There have been all kinds of naysayers exclaiming that his totals don't equate greatness but rather that he started earlier and has played longer than most of the greats who achieved more. Well, to that I say, **starting early isn't an option of your not good enough, and** he certainly was. His selection from highschool was validated with the Rookie of Year award. His longevity since that point is nothing but a marker of mental discipline. ""You cheat your body, it will cheat you"". LeBron's mental discipline to maintain his health for so long has yielded groundbreaking results for his career.  It's like this, Mike left the game willingly **TWICE**, Kobe broke down after his 17th year and left unwillingly, LeBron year 17...still  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;going steady.  Mr. 34k 9k 9k is still open for business. **Four (4) Jordan's lack of rivalry:** To the Michael Jordan ""stans"", consider this, what if Magic Johnson doesn't prematurely retire in 1992?  Follow where I am going with this for a second. Now, was Mike the best player in the league then? Undoubtedly! But as a team sport, **the best player in the league doesn't win a championship every year the best team does**. I believe this was meant to be Magic's role by default, to slow down the rise of the Jordan dynasty. I think his premature retirement removed the gatekeeper and premier competitor to Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls in the early '90s. Maybe, instead of 3 championships Jodan wins 2, maybe 1, and possibly doesn't retire.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Fact, Magic's '91 Laker team stands alone as the only team that Jordan played in the Finals that were favored to win; however slight of a favorite they were. Not convinced? Think of it like this, imagine if Magic roamed the '80s with no Bird? Is it unreasonable to think he wins 6 or 7 championships? I don't think so considering the quality of his teams, coaching, and that he had 9 finals appearances.  ""The Last Dance"" did well to skim over the NBA epoch of Magic Johnson's announcement. I thought it both convenient and suspect, as ESPN ranks this moment as one of the top 25 epochs in all of sports! It would be like LeBron playing in a league with a recently retired Tim Duncan.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;He maybe ends up 6-9 stays in Miami and never goes back to Cleveland.

"PART 1  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;""The Last Dance"", sigh...what can be said? It features the basketball legacy of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. The self-styled ""docuseries"" presents unparalleled insight into the Bull's dynasty. It is a view of their achievements from mostly Mike's perspective through the microcosm of the '90s. And for most, it was an introduction or reintroduction to the style, beauty, and grace of Jordan's sublime performances during that era of basketball.  Incredibly, ""The Last Dance"" does well to highlight the crux of ""the black cat's"" greatness. That is, the heavily touted ""6-0"" (six'n-O), yes, MJ's brilliant NBA finals record. The filmmakers and editors spared no expense on ensuring that the viewer saw the obstacles that Mike had to contend with beyond the court. Yes, those very same ""obstacles"" that made his achievements not only historic but a feat in and of itself.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;And boy, did they ever strive to drive that point home! *Now and then, the term""objective filmmaking"" has been tossed around... cue cringe.* Don't get me wrong though, ""The Last Dance"" is certainly an entertaining and insightful project worth the watch (kudos)!  So then, what are we left with? We take Mike's ""6-0"" juxtaposed to LeBron's dismal 3-9 finals record. I understand that for most Michael Jordan fans, apologists, and ardent supporters, it renders a simple no contest in the ""Greatest Of All Time"" debate! Yet, the debate not only continues but thrives!  Still,  I want to provide four possible reasons why I think the debate continues.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;And why, despite all the ""evidence"" to the contrary, that **#KingJames is the #goat.** **One (1), ""Losing"" matters:**  In the universe of sports, there is a tradition of rooting for either an individual or a team's success. We marvel at the spectacle of the world's greatest athletes competing, living vicariously through them while finding inspiration through the magnificent performances on display.  The appropriate label for this heavily vested group of people is in the world of sports is known as **fanatics;** commonly known today as fans.    Now, a fan's claim to fame is defined **""year in and year out""** by loyalty to a team or a player. And the only way to prove this **""loyalty""**,  is by **""representing""** for your team or player when they are not on top of the food chain.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;**Yes, I said it, a true fan is defined by losses not wins.** This is the **""right of passage""** in sports culture.  And it is reasonable to understand why. Think about it this way. After an epic team loss, the media spotlight moves away, criticism and gloating from the victors loom overhead. Amid this failure, when enduring the feeling of shared loss, athletes and the fans build somewhat of an intimate connection; a sense of solidarity if you will.  This tried and tested loyal club of supporters is known as **""true fans"".**  Now, given the quality of the high-level failures that LeBron James has encountered in his professional career, it is safe to say that ***""The Kang""*** **has tons of true fans.**  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;*The 2007 finals sweep, 2009 Loss to Dwight's Magic ECF, 2010 Boston beat down, 2010 the decision, 2011 ""the frozen one"", 2014 record finals blowout to the Spurs, Finals 2015 loss to GSW, 2017 &amp; 18 Finals loss to GSW. Eight straight trips to the finals, for three wins, no bandwagon required.* Still, the hidden part of the narrative here, why losses matter, is that **heroes are not always winners**. For example, Jesus of Nazareth, Leonidas I of Sparta, Hannibal Barca of Carthage, Patrice Lumumba of the Congo, Nelson Mandela of South Africa, and Dr. Martin Luther King. All respective heroes, not necessarily winners. Though not to be defined as political or spiritual, LeBron has found himself among this vestige of men.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;His consistent ability to **#striveforgreatness** against formidable foes both on the basketball court and the mainstream media has made him a modern-day hero to some. To continue, LeBron's noteworthy pursuit of excellence, not cheating the game with effort, has handcrafted somewhat of a roller-coaster career like no other. It has seen him through to the **lowest lows and highest highs** with all the twists and turns in-between. The results, a battle-hardened group of **true fans** that have appreciated the roller coaster journey; and what a ride it continues to be. #witnesses To LeBron's greatness, he has embodied the motif of the **phoenix,** repeatedly rising from the ashes of epic losses.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;**Somehow he represents both the greatest superstar meltdown in NBA history in 2011 and has arguably engineered the greatest comeback win in NBA history;** earmarking the feat by leading both teams in all major statistical categories. So then it's no surprise that to date, his career has been **equally satisfying for haters and supporters** alike, making his sensational play ""box office"" for those who want to revel in his defeat or celebrate in his victories. Honestly, few people can relate to being ""dominant"" like MJ was in their respective fields of expertise. Whether in a profession or hobby, most of our lives are tempered with a cycle of successes and failures. Maybe that's why the archetypical hero is one that losses in the beginning and wins in the end?  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;You know, arc to arc, the thing that makes a good story a saga. **It somehow grows, it inspires, it connects, it lends to the narrative.** Point is, losses and defeats add a compelling intrigue to a hero story like nothing else. We only need to look to the Marvel Universe's "" Avengers"" for a relevant example. One of the highest-grossing films of all time. It features an epic defeat followed by an epic win as a notable part of the series. As it relates, LeBron's career has the potential to become the greatest story in NBA history. His beginnings, the expectation, the decision, the incessant criticism, the hard-fought victories against the odds continue to define the narrative cycle of his career.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Put it this way, we know what happened in Dallas, then he redeemed himself with his comeback win against the Warriors. Then recently he had the first injury of his career and misses the playoffs #washedking if somehow LeBron becomes the first player to win three finals MVPs for three franchises this season, he will successfully supplant the moniker of journeyman to a conqueror.  What a potential legacy! What an epic story!  **Two (2) The ""Physical era"" is overstated:**  Take a look at the '80s and '90s basketball era, the first thing you notice are those short shorts. The second thing you notice, is that the guys on the floor just move a tick slower, and the movements on the basketball court are not as dynamic as it is today.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;It is a fact that the athletes today are bigger, stronger, and faster on average. But the game is somehow ""softer""? Following popular public commentary, It comes down to the **hand-check rule** in that era.  Before 2004, players in the league could engage in contact with an offensive player without a foul call. In that era, refereeing allowed the contest to flow with an **aggressive style of play**. Seriously, a flagrant foul was almost nonexistent and offensive and defensive fouls came from the school of hard knocks. This was the **era of less-skilled physically gifted players taking the role of enforcers.** It was also an era where the bigger stronger skilled players dominated.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Nowadays, people say that this era made it that much harder for Jordan to be as dominant. I beg to differ! Come on, the **defensive player of the year and 9x defensive first-team selection and 3x steal champion seems to agree with me that Jordan was in his element.** Remember, this was an era of great big men, not the era of guards. And what is the achilles heel of all big men? They can not bring the ball up the floor, they need guard play to be successful. Jordan and Pippen were elite big guards at their position in that era, perfectly placed to handicap the opposing offense and the big man's ability to dominate the game. Simply take a look at the footage, we see Jordan and Pippen steering, stiff-arming, pushing, hacking, and bullying the smaller players on the wing on defense.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;On offense, they still could hit with low shoulders and moving shoves if the defender was in the act of hand-checking, and the referee would not ""call it"".The point here is, **the ability to hand-check greatly improved Mike's impact on the game.** **The rule worked as an advantage for him, not a disadvantage, so stop the nonsense.**  Today, defense boils down to forcing players to change direction, deflections, and disrupting the passing lanes. This is commonly employed as ""zone defense"" today. However in that era, it was known as illegal defense. It is important to understand, zone defense allows defenders to roam the sweet spots of offensive players and set more sophisticated defensive schemes by committee.  &amp;nbsp;"
"Na, I agree that any player (MJ included) needs support to win a team sport. The OP seems to say that Pippen is significantly more important than any of Lebron's super teams. I don't agree with that. Pippen was certainly a huge plus, and his team friendly contract was key, but I think it's fair to say that Pippen is at least comparable to 2 all stars (Bosh + Wade or Irving + Love), so if that's a reasonable comparison, MJ = 6/6, Lebron is 3/8.   I'd also concede that James got unlucky in going against the super Warriors the whole time, but it's not like MJ played no one, and in the end you play the team in front of you, so that only goes so far.  Lebron has been monumental for the game and is a true beast, but he seems to value getting his friends paid over winning at all costs, and for that reason he isn't GOAT in my eyes. Magic's take is reasonable, but let's be real, it's all semantics and bullshit. In the end, when people try to devalue MJ, it comes down to ""it probably would have been different if"" but reality is that he won every time he got the chance.   Bottom line, if I need to win a 7 game series in the Finals, I'm taking MJ all day. I'd trust MJ to put his life on the line, and to find a way to will his team to a win no matter the cost."
The efficiency difference is minuscule and I would argue that you should wait till his career ends when that difference might be reversed. And I would not say that it is more competitive   https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/michael-jordan-faced-better-competition-than-lebron-james/amp/
LeBron James has been to the NBA Finals 9 times. NINE. Just let that sink in. Not to mention the 9 Eastern Conference Championships he’s won. Greatness.

"No it’s not lol.   It’s lower  &gt; So we consulted with Justin Page from ESPN Stats &amp; Information, who informs us that the league average in that situation, in the same time frame, is more than double LeBron's conversion rate but still a rather modest 22.7 percent  http://espn.go.com/blog/marc-stein/post/_/id/4396/clutch-shots-are-tough-just-ask-lebron-james"
"Lebron James.  He's not as good as Lebron, but imo they have the most similar playing style. Unselfish playmaking forwards with a strong finishing ability and inconsistent outside shot. Great athletes with the ability to guard multiple positions."
"Better teammates is questionable wade himself is better than Scottie and I would put Kyrie right below that so....  Best competition? He beat Magic prior to the announcement so..., and also beat the Bad Boy Pistons.  For the finals I refer you to this article https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/michael-jordan-faced-better-competition-than-lebron-james/amp/  The coach is Lebron own fault he doesn’t want to be coached that way, he tried to get his best coach Spo fired and went out of his way to get yes men like Ty Lue appointed.  Jordan quit for 1.5 years and that’s fair, the second come back wasn’t even that it was to set the stage for buying the team which fell through."
"LeBron James, who has been in the public eye since he was a sophomore in high school, and who has been at the absolute pinnacle of his profession for over a decade lacks top-tier drive? Oooooookay gonna unsubscribe from this sub for a few weeks until everyone gets this 10-piece Jordan Brand Press Release out of their systems."
"&gt; MJ is significantly superior to LeBron on the offensive and defensive end   So that's a lie.  At their peaks, LeBron was a more impactful defender than Jordan. In pure man-to-man perimeter defense, MJ has Bron beat, but LeBron James brings so much more versatility on defense, and can legit guard 1 through 4.5.    As for offense, yes, MJ is the most prolific scorer in NBA history. However, LeBron James is one of the top 5 best scorers of all time, was more efficient than MJ, and is also a GOAT-tier playmaker. Offense =\= ppg."
*lost to superior competition and here’s and fun article for you  https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/michael-jordan-faced-better-competition-than-lebron-james/amp/  Who gives a fuck about versatility Golden Corral is more versatile than a Michelin restraint but I know where I want to eat. Jordan was a way better defender  And honestly Jordan is faster   A lower PER pokes a hole in that efficiency arguement as well
"If I remember correctly, Dwyane Wade also contributed heavily in the game against Indiana, nearly matching James output to the best of his ability (Wade was hindered by wear and tear).   But that game in Boston is stamped in my memory. The shear dominance that Lebron displayed that game was unbelievable to watch. In my eyes, his best game ever. It was win or go home, and as a fan I felt the pressure too. The combination of dominance and pressure situation puts this above any other game if only by a bit, but still deserving so."
LeBron if he counts and steph curry if he doesn’t. James harden doesn’t have enough postseason resiliency for me.
Timing is pretty accurate. But Lebron is not bigger than Kobe and Kanye is not bigger than Wayne in my opinion. I think  Future = James harden

Because everyone's eyes are now wide open since seeing the doc... Jordan is the undisputed GOAT. Lebron James is top 4.
"I’ll dog pile on to your point with my own hot take: people who worship Jordan and pretend like LeBron James wouldn’t hold a candle to him haven't played a semi competitive game of full court basketball in a decade+. Evolution is real folks, the incremental changes from generation to generation seem slight, but boy howdy, as a former “stud” in my younger years, the amount of times I (34 year old in shape male) have my ass handed to me by a super athletic 19 year old who’s “just out there for funsies” is unreal. Every generation is slightly faster, longer, leaner, smarter, and stronger. And if you ain’t out there playin it and you’re just quoting jordan stats, your missing out on a large portion of the reality of the game."
PG: Magic Johnson   SG: Kobe Bryant   SF: Lebron James   PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo   C: Shaq
"He’s Lebron James. JJ was an unknown back then (not like he’s a star now, or anything) and Lebron was the king. It’s a joke that people want to make any excuse for him not sacking up and backing down a dude that was a foot shorter than him. You can bullshit about flops all you want, but if Lebron pushes that matchup, he’d get his superstar calls just like they all do. That’s how the league works. He didn’t do it, because he chose not to. Is it because he didn’t want to rock the boat and take over a team that was originally run by his best friend Wade? Is it because he got scared or choked? Who knows? But if he decided to go one-on-one with JJ Barea, he’s beating him 9 times out of 10. And he just didn’t."
"I watch every Mavs game. I’ve never heard them once say “The Barea Special”. Even Skin, who says that kinda stupid shit, has never to my knowledge uttered that phrase. I think you, Lakers fans and Heat fans may be the only people who hate on JJ Barea. Everyone loves him. He’s a 5’8” Puerto Rican that somehow became a viable NBA player, for fuck’s sake.   Lebron didn’t choose not to post him up because he was worried that Barea was somehow gonna get more star calls than LEBRON JAMES. He did it because he choked. Lebron back then was different than modern day Lebron. He wanted no part of being the go to guy in that finals.   Side note, JJ has married not one but two Miss Universe’s. That dude is living his best life."
"i disagree, lebron james has a history of choking on stacked teams.  i say they still win the same 6 rings, possibly less."
I guess Steve Kerr &gt; LeBron James?
"I didn’t argue anything. Lebron James has attempted 5,409 threes in his career and made 1,860 for 34.4% mark. MJ attempted 1,778 and made 581 for a career 32.7%. Lebron is a better 3 point shooter."
kid if you’re actually trying to argue that lebron james is a better jump shooter than michael fucking jordan  is your iq in the double digits?
"He was a great scorer, honestly he would probably be a little better if he played today, he could play 3 or 4 and shot a high volume of 3's at good efficiency.   As far as rankings go, let's do it by tiers.  **Players who are absolutely better**  Lebron, Bird, Kevin Durant, Dr. J, Elgin Baylor, Scottie Pippen, Rick Barry, John Havliciek, Kawhi (some might debate this cuz of longevity, but his peak has FAR surpassed Pierce)  So that's 9  **Players who are probably better**  Dominique Wilkins,  James Worthy   **Players who are arguably better**  Carmelo Anthony, Paul George (this might be controversial, but I'm prepared to debate it), Adrian Dantley (his individual stats are pretty incredible, but his style of play wasn't that conducive to a good offense), Alex English  &amp;#x200B;  So yeah, for me I think he would fall right outside of my top 10.  I'd probably put him above the players in the third tier."
"""Completly weak and pathetic move by Lebron James showing that he once again, is too scared of the big stage of the NBA. Michael JEFFREY Jordan wouldnt NEVER left the NBA in his prime to pursue othe professional sp-.... Oh uh - moving on..."""
"It’s less about the loss itself &amp; more about how he played. If he had been playing like LeBron James &amp; they lost, LBJ haters would still be there, but the overarching finger-pointing might shift elsewhere.  The Mavs loss + Spurs win 2x lets the LBJ storyteller paint a picture of overcoming adversity over a legendary team/coach/organization &amp; not just a bunch of good players winning because they could just roll the balls out there &amp; dunk on everyone. He “learned how to win” or some nonsense.  Instead we have the Big 3 falling on their face in that 2nd Spurs series, falling apart physically &amp; getting ran off the court."
"The three rings that came after their toughest opponent in each run suffered catastrophic injuries? LMAO. The most stacked team ever and they still got lucky with injuries.  2015: Love misses the entire series, Irving gets injured after Game 1 and misses the rest of the series. LeBron and Mozgov still take Golden State to 6.   2017: Kawhi Leonard gets injured in Game 1, misses the rest of the WCF. The 61-21 Spurs are turned into a punching bag that probably wouldn't even make the playoffs.   2018: Chris Paul gets injured after going up 3-2, misses Games 6 and 7. James Harden and role players still have double digit halftime leads in both games.  That's not even counting the myriad of other injuries to lesser opponents."
"People hated the Warriors so much in 2016 that the second most hated thing by NBA fans at that point (LeBron James) became the most beloved thing by beating them.  After Game 5 ""LeBron is a bitch!"" After game 7 ""LeBron is the GOAT"""

Lol do you think LeBron James is going to report to the Cincinnati fuckin Bengals training camp if they got to draft him first? Cmon.   Do you think it’s a coincidence that Michael Jordan got to play pro baseball for the White Sox?
"Something as consequential as those close to Kobe fucking Bryant having an issue with LeBron fucking James' speech at his damn memorial will be reported, yes. How dense are you?"
You don’t think Lebron James could rival the likes of Tony Gonzalez in terms of longevity? (15 Seasons)
https://www.sportscasting.com/how-many-coaches-has-lebron-james-gotten-fired/ He also tried to get spoelstra fired and basically forced Cleveland to trade Wiggins for love. Forced them to resign Tristan and JR at bloated contracts and then complained about them being so effing top heavy.
"to quote the great Lincoln Osiris, this whole debate culture and these takes are completely moronical.  Like, why do we even need to debate who was better?  Because Skip &amp; Stephen A. do it?  LeBron James is great, he's dominant and an all time player.  Michael Jordan was great and dominant and an all time player.  You don't need to say one was better than the other to appreciate how both players tranformed &amp; grew the game and have impacted the sports world and the cultural world at large.  There's room enough for all of them and the discourse around trying to parse out differences between eras and decide who is the GOAT just brings the whole discourse down to a truly shitty level."
"Kyrie is hella clutch, and LeBron James played for the Cavaliers."
These analysts are the same ones who call LeBron a freight train on the fast break and say you have to foul him harder when LeBron just moves through the physical defense and scores.  It's insane to say hand checking would contain LeBron James. Literally insane. This is the dude who people literally yank with both hands from the shoulders and still scores lol.
"Hart said this about Harden so he at least respects him  &gt;Josh Hart: ""The hardest [player] to guard is James Harden, by far. BY FAR. I guarded LeBron, I guarded KD... James Harden is the most skilled and he's very smart. You should just pray to God that he's not going to get the ball - that's what you should do when you defend him.""  https://twitter.com/AlexKennedyNBA/status/1051455732644753408"
"How gutless of a move Lebron James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh joining up to create a “super-team” in Miami was at the time.   Today the move is some what forgotten due to some combination of:   1) Not being as dominate as people expected (2 for 4).   2) Lebron coming back and winning in Cleveland   3) KD joining the warriors to create the real super team."
LeBron James averaged 28ppg on 68% true shooting in 2014. The Heat got fucking destroyed in 2014. You're delusional if you think he could've beaten them   2007 Spurs were literally prime Spurs.   2015 Golden State LeBron averaged 35ppg and it wasn't really close.  How fucking good do you think MJ was?
There’s also the story of him being linked to that steroid bust while he was in Miami that is never talked about at all   http://dystnow.com/2013/03/04/lebron-james-jameer-nelson-linked-to-miami-steroid-clinic/
"I'm a fan of 80's, 90's, 00's, and 10's basketball and one of the weirdest popular misconceptions I've seen is the notion that a guy like LeBron James ""wouldn't be able to handle going into the paint in 1989"".   Like, yeah, if James were transported through time mid-drive and ended up clotheslined by Bill Laimbeer, it'd probably be a shocking and surprising moment where he'd be wondering:  a) Why Laimbeer wasn't called for a flagrant and ejected  and   b) How the hell he was just instantly transported 30 years into the past, particularly without any access to plutonium?   Otherwise, if he knew what he was walking into, if we sent James on this Timecop mission back to 1989 where he was cognizant that the style of basketball was going to be a bit different, there'd be an acclimation period but then he'd still be LeBron James - a 6-foot-9, 250+ lbs. freak of basketball nature."
"That's 22 teams with their full rosters, that's an excess of 350+ players getting into contact with each other and actually playing a physical sport.  I understand people (fans/owners/players) wanting to push this tournament, but it's ridiculously irresponsible. If 1 player gets the virus, the tournament has to be shut down because that player could have infected entire teams.  Could you imagine if LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard were infected and were out of the tournament? That would completely delegitimize the playoffs and at that point, why bother?"

"I was really, really conflicted that year. Usually I easily prefer one team over the other but in 2016 I wanted both the Cavs *and* Warriors to win. I'm not sure I've ever enjoyed watching a team that wasn't mine as much as I enjoyed watching the Warriors that year. A ring would have been a perfect capper to a perfect year.  On that other hand, all I've wanted since he entered the league was to watch LeBron James win a championship for Cleveland. I knew he could do it and it was the driving force behind why I felt so crushed when he left for Miami. Then here he was in 2016 with a chance to fulfill that destiny.   I'm still a little bummed the perfect season was shot but if that's what had to happen to get LeBron a Cavs ring then it was worth it."
"How's that sexist? Y'all cant shut up about lebron james hypocrisy regarding his political stances, but since someone called out a women on her views, it's sexist?"
"But compare LeBron ""The Chosen One"" James from 2003 (and his whole class of high ego superstars) to our current 2019 class man. They're so much more grown up  Zion is humble af, Ja has the competitive spirit of a player like jimmy butler but w/o the ego (yet), RJ Barrett is Canadian, and this next group of promising players (Hunter, Culver, White, Hayes, Hachimura, Washington, Herro, Garland, Reddish) so far at least, they seem to be a pretty low ego bunch"
"The year is 2030, these are my 2020s decade predictions:  *Face of the league: Zion*  *Rounding out the top 3: Giannis, Luka*  &amp;#x200B;  ***1st Team All-Decade***  **Guards**: Trae Young, Luka Doncic  **Forwards:** Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jayson Tatum  **Big:** Zion Williamson  &amp;#x200B;  ***2nd Team All-Decade***  **Guards**: Ben Simmons, Ja Morant  **Forwards:** LeBron James, Pascal Siakam,  **Big:** Anthony Davis  &amp;#x200B;  ***3rd Team All-Decade***  **Guards:** Stephen Curry, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **Forward:** Kawhi Leonard  **Bigs:** Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid  &amp;#x200B;  *Other guys you mentioned:*  *Herro: Remembered like JR Smith*  *Bronny: On a 2-way, then a perennial 11th man*  *Kawhi: Retired in 2026 after signing a 5-year Veteran-level Super-max with the Clippers. Only plays 20 games in the 2025-2026 season*  *Note: in 2026 the NBA changed the All-NBA team format to be a flexible group of min. 1 - max. 2 guards, forwards, and bigs.*"

Luka was only around 100k shy of being a west all-star captain. He almost got it over LeBron fucking James. I think that speaks volume. Luka is incredibly popular.   In fact he got the 2nd most all-star votes overall. Behind LeBron obv.  Edit: Luka is also a lot better than Zion right now. There's a world where Zion never gets as good as Luka is right now.
"No he wasn't. He was being criticized for aggressively chewing his mouth guard, his family being oversaturated in the media, being portrayed as a nice humble christian when he's cocky on the court, being juxtaposed against players who grew up in poverty and was at the center of arguments that today's players wouldn't survive in older eras with increased physicality.   Curry's success also came at the DIRECT expense of LeBron James who has a bigger stanbase than actual teams in the NBA. They didn't like the push he got for being the best player in the league.

"&gt;Ali dodged the draft  &gt;but it wasn't so much giving up his career and freedom as trading them for safety.  Jesus christ lmao. You're repeating white supremacists talking points.  He was arrested. He gave up his livelihood to stand up for what he believed in. He thought it was wrong that black people were being sent to fight for democracy and freedom in a country on the other other side of world while they didn't enjoy either of those things in the US.  And here you are painting him as if he's a coward, just like segregationists did in the 60s  &gt;Kaep was wrongfully forced out but also did a lot to sabotage any return  HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO RETURN IN THE FIRST PLACE. STOP TRYING TO ACT LIKE ITS HIS FAULT.  &gt;At any rate, who cares about athletic activist dick measuring?   It isn't ""dick measuring"", it's character. The other guys had the character to stand up for what they believed. Lebron james has the character to stand up for his bank account.  It is perfectly valid to criticize him for that."

The insinuation isn't that Lebron James only cares about BLM because of $$$ ---- it's that he clearly doesn't care about HK because of $$$.  It's perfectly reasonable to call him out on the hypocrisy.
"This zero-sum nonsense doesn't help anyone. I also dislike the insinuation that LeBron James, a black man in America who has lived with the consequences of being black in America only cares about BLM for strictly financial reasons. It sounds like what Mainland Chinese say about the Hong Kong protests -- that they're only causing such a fuss because they want to maintain their privileged status as an ex-British colony -- and trust that cynics like you might actually believe it."
"&gt; Djokovic is the James Harden of tennis. Great stats because he plays a style (defense only, no attacking) that the courts favor.  That is unbelievably wrong.  I'm a big Djokovic hater but he's Lebron if anyone.  It's hard cause it's a trio with Fed, Novak, and Rafa but most have him as 2nd greatest of all time right now and at worst he's 3rd best ever.

My only concern posting this here is that this is not directly related to NBA games so it may be deemed as 'irrelevant'.  Hopefully it's relationship to LeBron James, the face of the current NBA, will be enough to keep this positive message up."
Why does Lebron have a James Harden beard
"Are we really still doing this shit?  This is exactly what that Dave Chappelle special was about.  We can do the same kind of shit with LeBron:  **LeBron James shows his true colors in a 2007 comment about former player John Amaechi coming out as gay: ""With teammates you have to be trustworthy, and if you're gay and you're not admitting that you are, then you are not trustworthy""**"
&gt; in large part due to the existence of LeBron James.  But how is this true when Lebron only eliminated KD from the playoffs once. You can’t really start going down a big list of hypotheticals as why Lebron is the large part of why KD didn’t dominate. There are a lot of reasons why he didn’t dominate that are completely unrelated to Lebron.
"Bird dominated the 80's in a way that KD was unable to do in his era, in large part due to the existence of LeBron James."

"Yes, because he and his team and the Nets were literally in China at the time. If you actually watched the video of him speaking, you'd know the first words out of Lebron's mouth were him saying that he himself wasn't informed on the HK situation and didn't feel he was in a position to speak about it. So if you had actually watched the context, you'd realize that during the next question when he called Morey misinformed, he was saying that about the situation the NBA teams were put in by the tweet while they were overseas. He wasn't calling Morey misinformed about HK itself  This is the first article that comes up when you google ""lebron hong kong"".

Nazi mods that hate BLM believe LeBron James isn’t relevant to the NBA
Lebron James said nothing about denying the holocaust
"Accept the reason this is even being discussed today is because someone mentioned his hypocrisy from the china perspective.  This thread wasn't started because of what LeBron said about BLM.  It was started because of what he said about Morey.

"""But getting the virus is the same as getting injured, and those happen every year so this is basically a regular postseason!""  No it isn't. Stop. Injuries aren't contagious. Major injuries almost never happen off-court. Injuries can be minor and aren't immediately a 14 day quarantine. This is a basketball championship, not a handwashing championship.  People saying there's no such thing as an asterisk are basically saying there's no such thing as **context**.  You mean to tell me that if the Rockets are facing the Lakers in the WCF and LeBron and AD are out with COVID, and the Rockets go on to win the championship, that it is just a totally normal ring? Years from now when we are talking about the greatest players of all time and James Harden's name comes up, you don't think it's at least worth **mentioning** that his one championship came in the lockdown playoffs???  Obviously there isn't a literal asterisk on any ring, and if you win then you win and that's great and you should absolutely celebrate it, but it's going to be mentioned forever as context for the 2020 NBA Finals. That's what people mean when they say ""asterisk.""   We just have to wait and see how it all plays out and maybe it won't be a huge difference from a normal postseason (I think it's going to be SUPER wonky), but people acting like this is just a regular postseason in the history books are kidding themselves. It's going to have reverberating effects years down the line, especially when discussing the legacies of individual players. If two stars both have one ring each when they retire, and one did it in a normal season and one did it in the bizarro world playoffs, then that HAS to come up when comparing careers."
Do you have so much racism and hate inside you that you wrap your own reality? Lebron James even said that his goal is to be a billionaire. Why are you so racist bringing up his skin color
"There was a point where Lebron was lobbying Adam Silver to get Daryl Morey punished for the Hong Kong Tweet:  &gt; “Nearly a week ago today, in a Shanghai hotel room, or Shanghai hotel ballroom, Adam Silver got up and addressed the players, and LeBron James is one of the players who got up and spoke and said, ‘Hey, what are we doing here? Daryl Morey made these statements,’” McMenamin said Tuesday of James’ comments.  &gt; **“You know damn well if a player made similar statements and caused such poor ramifications for the league, there would be some sort of league recourse. There would be repercussions the player has to pay,” James argued, according to McMenamin.**  &gt; **“Potentially this tweet could cost the NBA hundreds of millions of dollars, which could come out of the players’ pockets, and so that’s the double standard that was being addressed in that meeting.”**  Source: [LeBron James thought Daryl Morey should have been punished for tweet](https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/lebron-james-daryl-morey-punished-tweet/519049)  When you're proactively lobbying for the punishment of someone tweeting in support of a human rights protest, you're indirectly supporting the oppressive forces looking to suppress it.   Adam Silver had to remind Lebron and some of the players that Daryl Morey's first amendment right to tweet about Hong Kong is as protected as Lebron and other players' first amendment rights when they tweet about their disdain for Trump and his administration.   But allow me to circle back to the point:  there's nothing wrong with Lebron and his being a voice for BLM, but it's also not wrong to criticize his inconsistent stance on human rights issues, especially when back in 2018, he himself tweeted:  *[""-Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere-  Our Lives Begin To End The Day We Become Silent About Things That Matter- #ThankYouMLK50""](https://twitter.com/kingjames/status/952902403422150657)*"

"&gt;Most of the people outraged at James not taking a definitive stance on China’s handling of protesters in Hong Kong don’t care about the protesters themselves. The outrage isn’t about the plight of the protesters. The performative outrage is creating a new “what aboutism” to hold up next time the athletes speak out about a cause.  Yup, it has become clear that this is exactly the case. People rushing in to these threads to say ""what about China"" as a means to dismiss what LeBron and co. are saying about police brutality."
Is it? Lebron James was a much safer bet than Tom Brady to sign this. I'm not sure why they put Steve Kerr out there like he's a surprise though.
Lebron James only cares about money
Why is Lebron James thread lock?
LeBron James: bootlicker
No. 100% wrong.  He would be a hypocrite if he spoke out AGAINST Aboriginal rights in order to keep his mega-australian cash flow coming in.  That's what LeBron did.  Fuck. Qing. James.
Does anyone really gives a fuck what Lebron James has to say on political issues?
"I appreciate LeBron weighing in on topics of import, but he is NOT the dude that I want speaking on my behalf,as it relates to social discourse, no.   For whatever reason, the media loves to select the most famous Black athlete, and make them the Social Emissary.   This is all to say that LeBron isn't a hypocrite, he's just not the guy you're looking for.  There are a number of players (Jaylen Brown, Jeremy L, CJ Mc for example) who can give nuanced and substantive responses.   Even though James leans into this....speakership role, it isn't really fair to attack him in the way that some of you are.   And I'm NOT a James fan."

Are you a troll? I don't even know if you are worth responding to but do you really think the chinese government would have executed Lebron James if he had not tweeted that Daryl Morey was misinformed? because that is what is being discussed here.

Wtf! It is wild that you are using comparisons to Jim Crow to discredit the BLM movement. What kind of logic is that?  The movement and it's merit exist outside of LeBron James. He is not the face of it and his stature within it does not justify or discredit the movement. This is a classic example of what seems to be the true intentions of posts like these -- to to distract and discredit support for the BLM movement.
"&gt; or literally tortured, by the Chinese government should they have wanted former NBA players playing in China to refute Morey's comments.  It’s insane that people actually believe this nonsense. China has a cruel, authoritative government but they’re not utterly moronic enough to kidnap and torture Lebron fucking James."
There is no way China was going to hurt LeBron James lol. That would make the situation worse for them. You don’t go around arresting and torturing international super stars.
"It’s especially rich coming from someone like Lebron.   I’m well aware that a ton of education isn’t acquired through an academic setting, but Lebron has a high school diploma that he certainly didn’t have to work for (flunking *Lebron James* just isn’t a option), while Morey went to Northwestern for undergrad and MIT for his MBA.   How can you call someone like that “uneducated?”  Edit: To add to this, which one of these people would be more likely to continue to educate themselves after leaving academia?"

"Lebron James ***is*** a hypocrite. He didn't stay silent, he stood with china, something that I'll never forgive him for. I'd go as far as to say that if Lebron James was white, it's hard to tell if he'd support the BLM movement. If he was't affected, would he care? I mean that with all sincerity and without hate, as white person myself. It's just how that level of absolute hypocrisy makes me fell personally"
"Going by that logic, Lakers and Nets fans who claim to support the HK protests, or ideas of democracy and freedom of speech in general, are hypocrites, because their teams have Lebron James and Joseph Tsai."
"That’s a joke and a cop out. China was never going to murder Lebron James because he said something negative. They would just attack the wallet and launch a smear campaign, similar to tactics you see here."
"I think that is a copout. It is Lebron James, one of them most famous Americans. I don't think China would have done anything to him. I think Lebron was thinking more about his money."
"Ok. Let’s play the scenario out. Some exec of Huawei with some influence or LeBron James, the face of the NBA, has businesses in China. His influence is much greater in the public eye.  Do you really believe China would bend their own rules given the consequences??"
"Biggest superstar meltdown in NBA history, bar none.  LeBron and the Heat were HATED back in 2011 and most people outside of Miami wanted them to lose, but nobody ever dreamed that LeBron James would not show up in the fourth quarter of four straight games in the NBA Finals.   Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh played amazingly in that series too, which is a testament to how freaking stacked Miami was in those Heatles days.  Game 4 of that series against Dallas might be the biggest black mark in LeBron's legacy, a black mark that doesn't exist for guys like Kareem and MJ."
"lmao why are we acting like lebron needs to know the ins and outs of the hong kong's and china's relations. He knows china are violating human rights and that Hong Kong is fighting for democratic reform. Not only does he turn a blind eye to it, he denounces Daryl Morey for supporting Hong Kong. He put money over valuing democratic reform and human rights. That's pretty evil and inexcusable. There comes to a point, where as a human you should be able to look at a situation and empathise and understand, just like he's asking white people to do for Black people and other POC's living in America. Yet he couldn't do it for the people of Hong Kong cause money was involved?  I'm black, living in America and Lebron James' comments and tweets hold no value to me or carry no meaning. Supporting BLM is the RIGHT thing to do, and just because you're not Black or not affected by the systematic racism and police brutality in this country doesn't excuse you from having an important role in changing this country. Just like supporting the protestors was the RIGHT thing to do and with someone of Lebron James' influence denouncing a supporter of the protests is as bad as supporting the current regime China is enforcing on Hong Kong"
"LeBron James is averaging the lowest amount of minutes in his career. Why is that? Because the Lakers’ DEPTH is playing very well. Depth is 4-5 players that can contribute valuable minutes from the bench, while being able to rest your best players. For example, when the Lakers would bring in Quinn Cook into the lineup early on in the season they would struggle heavily. Quinn Cook can’t be put in the depth category. However, when they play Alex Caruso, the Lakers improve massively because his minutes are more valuable than Quinn Cooks. Caruso, Kuzma, KCP, Dwight Howard, all play valuable minutes and provide support for our star players. They also added Dion Waiters and Markieff Morris to make it a deep bench. That is called depth. Is it better than the Clippers depth? No probably not. But is it above average? Certainly. Otherwise LeBron would not be averaging a career low in minutes, while also leading the Lakers to 1st in the West."
"Dude the difference is, LeBron James loves to preach about morality. His morals betray him when his own money is involved. That makes his moral lectures annoying and hypocritical.   If some protestor was breaking LeBron's car, he would have beat the shit out of him too, just like JR did. He's fanning the flames for the current state in America, but I'm 200% sure he wouldn't if his own money/property was at stake. That's what shitty. He is preaching morality only when his money and life is not affected. Look at Muhammad Ali, Colin Kaepernick. They lost for the cause. LeBron just uses it for clout."
"The Sad reality from an asian american is that people only cares about racism on their terms. Lebron James is a giant hypocrite as he wants to be a billionaire more than anything else. Its easy to talk about black racism in America as its accepted by majority of Americans but the cleansing of Tibet, HK and Muslim conflicts with the china's potential market opportunity. Realistically speaking, I hope USA do something similar to the UK and open borders for HK citizens."
"I don’t think you understand the power the Chinese government has.   Lebron James would become [redacted] in China and the 1.4 billion people that live in China wouldn’t be able to buy and Lebron products, watch any of his games, etc.   If you don’t think pissing off the Chinese government would affect his revenue, than you don’t understand how huge the Chinese market is and how powerful their governments control over their people are"
"LeBron ""China"" James"
"The point is he did speak out, but he speak out to tell everyone to shut up about Hong Kong because supporting the cause will hurt him financially. That's quite different than not speaking out because he is not directly involve.   References:   1.

[LeBorn's interview](https://twitter.com/BenGolliver/status/1183917743680020480)"
It’s really simple: Lebron James directly profits from China and he publicly scolded Morey for his tweet for being “inconsiderate of others in the situation” meaning he told Morey to shut the fuck up because that was going to ruin the Chinese money train. Lebron chose the money over what’s morally right while constantly getting on some “injustice everywhere...” shit.   Hong Kong protestors HAVE shown solidity with the Americans btw it’s a shame the west hasn’t done the same with them and the others who are in oppression and injustice.
"Did Joshua Wong say that Lebron wanst educated on the situation at hand and that this coupd possibly hurt the NBA financially?   &gt;“I don’t want to get into a word- or sentence-feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand,” James [told reporters](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-15/lebron-james-calls-morey-tweet-on-hong-kong-misinformed) in October after the Lakers played a preseason game in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. “And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually.”"

Why are we acting like NBA superstars have a clue about global politics?  Lebron James hasn’t even attended college.  Why does his opinion hold any weight on issues?  Lebron is going to be misinformed more than any person with a degree.  I just don’t get why people care so much about what he and other players say.  These issues are more important than NBA or Hollywood.  So celebrities who think their opinions are somehow relevant need to just slow their roll
It’s the same as Michael Jordan not publicly supporting the black community for years until it was okay to do so. All athletes and businesses don’t give a fuck about social issues unless it will help their brands too. The reason Mohammad Ali is considered the GOAT athlete is his impact on social issues at the time. Do you think Lebron James or let alone any athlete today will change his name or willing to be sentenced in jail for his beliefs?
"""Iguodala to Curry, back to Iguodala, up for the layup, OH BLOCKED BY JAMES, LEBRON JAMES WITH THE REJECTION.""  I remember watching that and just being hit by the realization I just watched an iconic play in the making."
I’m gonna get shit for this but if Lebron actually aligned himself with Morey and with Hong Kong situation then things would be worse then they are now. He and the NBA in general would have lost and incredible and the backlash from China would have been crazy because the most famous Athlete in the world is saying it. Lebron is not Mohammed Ali and that’s not a bad thing Ali was willing to sacrifice his career and James is not. Imo he should have just said something like what harden said and try to skip the question but I can understand why he did what he did
"Article:   Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong accused LeBron James of hypocrisy after the NBA superstar moved to form a group supporting black voting rights in the U.S.  Wong, the former student protester who has testified before the U.S. Congress on behalf of Hong Kong democracy activists, said in a tweet Thursday that James’s position clashes with his past comments on the protests in the former British colony. James was widely criticized in Hong Kong last year for calling basketball executive Daryl Morey’s support for the city’s protesters “misinformed.”  “Defending democracy is vital, but @KingJames only talks loud in the US,” Wong said. “All he cares about is money, not human rights. Hypocritical   Some Hong Kong protesters have expressed solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in the U.S., in part because both share a common criticism of police tactics. Street protesters have adopted some methods popularized by their Hong Kong counterparts during clashes with police in cities across the U.S. in recent weeks.  While James has long been vocal on U.S. political issues and announced plans to start a group protecting black voting rights this week, the Lakers star provided key support for the National Basketball Association during its dispute with China over Hong Kong last year. Beijing reacted to Morey’s tweet by canceling broadcasts of NBA games in the crucial overseas market.  “I don’t want to get into a word- or sentence-feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand,” James told reporters in October after the Lakers played a preseason game in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. “And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually.”  Global companies and brands are increasingly becoming caught up in a wider geopolitical struggle between the U.S. and China as the world’s biggest economies spar on everything from Hong Kong to 5G networks to territorial disputes. Vice President Mike Pence last year said the NBA was “siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech” while also accusing Nike Inc. of “checking its social conscience at the door” when it comes to human rights in China.  ‘Corporate Kowtows’  Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo criticized HSBC Holdings Plc for backing China’s move to impose national security legislation in Hong Kong, saying free nations don’t deal in “political and corporate kowtows.” The Trump administration is currently weighing sanctions against China over the proposed laws, which critics fear would curb essential freedoms in the semi-autonomous territory.   HSBC and Standard Chartered Plc, the two British institutions that dominate Hong Kong’s banking system, both backed Beijing in the standoff over the proposed new security laws. Their top executives have expressed support for America’s black community amid widespread revulsion over the death of George Floyd more than two weeks ago in police custody in Minneapolis.  Fashion companies also find themselves caught in the middle. While brands including Coach and Versace have been active in voicing support for equality and diversity and strongly condemning the killing of Floyd, they were more reserved when Hong Kong protesters voiced their anger against China, the biggest market for luxury goods. Last August, when facing a backlash for referring to Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries, they quickly sent their apologies to calm consumers and correct their websites to show their respect for “the feelings of the Chinese people” and “national sovereignty.”  ‘How Do We Fix This?’  NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in October the league would “double down” on engaging with the people of China and other countries “regardless of their governments.” Nike in March said it was reviewing its supply chain after a report included it among well-known brands that may have used forced labor from China’s Uighur Muslim minority.  Joe Tsai, the majority owner of the Brooklyn Nets who co-founded Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., also wrote an open letter to NBA fans that characterized the pro-democracy protests as a “separatist movement” -- echoing the Communist Party’s view on the demonstrations. The protesters, however, were calling for meaningful elections in the financial hub.  Wong, who served two months in jail for his role in 2014 protests that shut down large swaths of the city, has been barred from seeking political office for his past support of “self-determination.” China is currently drafting national security legislation in Beijing that’s expected to levy harsher sentences against Hong Kong residents convicted of supporting secession or cooperating with foreign powers, among other offenses.  The NBA’s James said in a tweet on Wednesday that African-American precincts in Georgia were disproportionately affected by problems with new electronic voting machines that caused confusion and long lines during the Democratic primary. He tied the issues with voting to the protests over police brutality that have been sweeping the U.S. since Floyd’s death.  “Everyone talking about ‘how do we fix this?’ They say ‘go out and vote?’ What about asking if how we vote is also structurally racist?”"
"The problem with this is that the 1996 Bulls basically had two Jordans.  We forget, but there were people that thought that Scottie Pippen was the best player in the league in 1996, even ahead of Jordan.  [https://s7.gifyu.com/images/Pippen-4.png](https://s7.gifyu.com/images/Pippen-4.png)  Michael Jordan himself even acknowledged the rumblings of Pippen being the best player on the Bulls in 1996.  [https://s7.gifyu.com/images/Pippen-6.png](https://s7.gifyu.com/images/Pippen-6.png)  So the only players in the league that can do what Scottie Pippen did during this period are like LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard.  Butler isn't good enough.  Paul George isn't good enough.  I'd include Giannis but he doesn't have the playoff experience."

"There is precedent for a losing player to win the award - mind you it’s from 1969, the first time the award was ever given, and it’s never happened since. But looking at some recent FMVPs it makes one wonder whether icing to a winning player is actually the best practice.   2014:  LeBron James: 28/8/4 on 57/52/79  FMVP Kawhi: 18/6/2 on 61/58/78  2015:  LeBron James: 36/13/9 on 40/31/69  FMVP Iguodala: 16/6/4 on 52/40/36"

"Brandon Williams was one of several family members who spoke at the service for Floyd, who died May 25 while in the custody of Minneapolis Police. Williams said Floyd – who close family members called ""Perry"" – would always make sure he had sneakers and clothes as they connected through sports.   ""He was the biggest LeBron James fan,"" Williams recalled. ""When the Cavaliers came back on the Golden State Warriors in the Finals, and I remember the very first phone call. I told him, 'You're too happy. You sound like you won a championship.'

LeBron Raymone James.  Larry Bird.
"The title of the article is ""LeBron James is finally taking the plunge into politics"", isn't it? Or did you not even read the title of the thread you're in."
Even if Lebron is washed and bronny is a bust. You don’t think an NBA team would spend a second rounder to get 50 million in jersey sales between James and James Jr?
How do you figure ? You’ll be allowed to go straight to the league again by then and you don’t think someone’s gonna draft Lebron James Jr. out of high school??
Yeah he literally endorsed Hillarly Clinton last election and had an oped and everything: https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-why-endorsing-hillary-clinton-for-president-2016-9  I don't know how you can plunge into politics more than that.

"I can't remember who but one of LeBron's former teammates has said before that the guy eats like shit (or at least did when he was younger) and is somehow always in perfect shape.  Ninja edit: Found the source, it's [Tristan Thompson](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2876113-tristan-thompson-lebron-james-has-worst-f-king-diet-ever-eats-like-s-t.amp.html), so not that much younger at all."
Because one plays in Milwaukee for the Bucks and the other in LA for the Lakers next to Lebron James.
"Lowry is a great ball handler. He’s just not Westbrook.   If the pocket rockets fail, we can talk about it. But he’s a slasher who can’t shoot well. Look at Giannis. Of course spacing would help him, and the fact that he’s done so much without spacing says wonders. His team still isn’t as talented as the rest, but he’s still be a phenomenal second option.   I mean, if LeBron James and Chris Bosh got hurt like KD and Klay did, I’m sure the 2012 Thunder win that series as well. Westbrook has been close enough to winning as a second option to easily say he is a 2nd or third championship option caliber player."
"Sigh. This is literally purely narrative and not based on anything of significance.   ... he’s played with two others of the best players and it didn’t work out...? How? The Rockets when Westbrook and Harden are on have looked amazing. And many think they are the only team that could challenge the two LA teams. What are you saying?  And the Thunder were one of the most winningest teams of the last decade with Durant. When Westbrook got hurt in 2013, following their Finals berth, what happened? KD lost one the second round to the Grizzlies. Isn’t that direct proof that this narrative your pushing is false?   The Thunder were constant conference Finals threats, and if it wasn’t for running into dynasties and having three years ruined to injuries, they would’ve probably gotten a ring. But just because they didn’t get a championship, doesn’t mean they didn’t have long term winning success. They actually factually had long term winning success lmao what the fuck? What type of broken logic is this?   Lowry adjusted his play... sort of like what Westbrook did for Paul George last year? When he had the lowest usage rate of his career, and PG13 was a MVP candidate? Um...But sure, Russ doesn’t make sacrifices haha.   And just lol at the team USA stuff. Just stop it.   Durant wanting time leave is proof? You mean this Durant, who went on his burner accounts and DIRECTLY BLAMED everyone but Russ? [this?](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/afzPD6KPeeHR7CuvU0YFzNuRkTY=/1400x1400/filters:format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9270815/DJ_rfGFUQAEDLWS.jpg)   And if you have Westbrook on your teams, you win games. What team failed to do just that? He carried a team where half the roster was out of the league in the next to years to almost 50 wins. He spent most of his career battling with Western conference dynasties.   Did he win a ring? No. But I’m sure if he was in the weaker Eastern Conference, with no LeBron James, with an elite role playing roster, he would have to. ESPECIALLY if there opponents best and third best player got injured in the series Finals.   Against, stop talking about things you don’t know about. Everything you said was almost entirely false, and I proved it with actual facts."
"no, he was reportedly the lone voice suggesting fines on Morey for speaking out  that's what made it problematic for me personally - that he didn't just speak out against the people of HK, but that he suggested fining those speaking in their favour for getting involved where he felt they shouldn't.   it was because he felt players would have been fined for speaking out, which is more understandable, but the fact that he was also publicly complaining about his financial priorities in China definitely coloured my perception of his motivations there  [here's a random source from google](https://www.theballzone.com/2019/10/lebron-james-pressured-adam-silver-to-punish-rockets-gm-daryl-morey-for-controversial-tweet/) for added verification, there are plenty more.

Somewhere between exceptionally and historically good. Perhaps even unprecedented.  They then went on to be one of only 5 NBA teams in history to make 4 straight Finals. They were one poor performance of LeBron against the Mavs from having a nearly identical Finals record to the Warriors 2015-2019 run."
"With complete respect, it feels like you're just BasketballReferencing right now because I'm not sure anyone who actually watched the Pistons back then could come away thinking the way you do about Ben Wallace.   Those Pistons don't exist in the first place without Ben Wallace (an era that actually began in 2001 when the team was expected to be a bottom feeder but then came out and won the Central).    At his peak, some of his numbers were gaudy (15+ rebounds, 3.5 blocks) but most who watched know his game went so far beyond the box score. A nearly unparalleled help defender, one of the best at hedging and trapping the pick and roll, could switch out whenever necessary, kept possessions alive with offensive rebounds and back-tips, was nearly as likely to take a charge as he was to block a shot, etc.   He wasn't the *only* reason the Pistons won (that's why they're known as an all-time great collective), but I'll say this - that LeBron James Game 5 performance in 2007 is one of the most amazing basketball moments I've ever seen... but from time to time I wonder what would have happened if Ben Wallace was under that bucket waiting to step up and help instead of Jason Maxiell. If the Pistons held LeBron to scoring 27 of his team's last 28 instead of 29 of their last 30, they probably win that game.   So while the team still reached the conference finals following his departure, his absence was still felt. He was the first crack in the foundation and the Pistons' lack of heart in those '07 and '08 postseasons is a large part of what led to the team's dismantling."
Lebron James
"He'll talk about how MJ is a cheater and overrated and how Lebron James is a better man, pure, and only had sex with his wife."
I know I was late to the party but I was wondering how hard was it to defend against LeBron James and what things I can take from his game as a 6foot 8th grader and ally it to mine I heard a podcast were some nba player I forgot the name was comparing how it was like to plan and defend against  kobe  and how it was to defend against LeBron. Basically he said how LeBron u had to worry about pick and roll and being strong enough to deal with his physicality . Was this exactly how it was like defending him.

"Hi Gilbert.   You made childhood me happy by responding, ""Bitch, I might be"" while asking if you were Gilbert Arenas while in DC.   LeBron James ruined most of the Wizards' play-off runs in mid-2000s that the Wizards went on. Why did you let him do that to us and why is it all Antawn's fault."
"&gt; Does a 5'10 Congolese citizen have a higher chance of making the NHL or the NBA? &gt;  &gt;   Right now, it is about 0 to 0 in the current world. Yuta Tabuse is the only individual raised outside of the United States under 5'10 to make the NBA, he played 4 entire games. It just does not happen. A combination of lack of Basketball infrastructure, lack of popularity and most importantly, the inherent advantages of height that the game of Basketball provides doesn't make it something that is obtainable.   Statistically, it is easier for LeBron James to become an outlier among basketball players than it is for Wayne Gretzky to become an outlier among hockey players due to his genetic advantages. No matter how many Congolese, Indonesian, Indian and Banghladeshi you believe LeBron is theoretically competing against in your brain."

"It was two years ago the last time, but we saw Lebron drag that last Cavs team to the finals playing 40 minutes a game. We've seen Lebron play 40 minutes in the playoffs over and over again. I'll believe Lebron can't do that type of thing in the playoffs when I see Lebron unable to do that type of thing in the playoffs. Besides, everyone is tired playing big minutes and Lebron shouldn't have to play 40 minutes a game against every team.      The Raptors do offer more help than other teams and they are better at rotating than most, but they do not just help off everyone without concern. [Here](https://youtu.be/iPQy2jsxHoI?t=71) you see them staying tight on KP on the strong side on a Luka pick and roll. They're offering a standard weakside help on a pass that it is easier to rotate out to while FVV stays relatively close on Curry. Or [here](https://youtu.be/ckEIHFR2GTM) where they stay tight on Green. The Raptors do help off of bad shooters and sometimes good shooters even, but a lot of that changes in the playoffs. It is one thing to play such a style against regular season teams and another to do it against Lebron James.       We haven't actually seen the full on 2 man game of Lebron and Davis. In the Raptors game we mostly saw Davis at the 4 when Lebron was on the court. The main pick and roll partner of Lebron when Davis is on the floor is the other big man and it is easier to help when the Lakers play the two bigs. The Raptors do double the post, but AD has improved his passing and the Lakers would not be so off guard regarding double teams from there. It is easy to talk about keeping Davis out of the post, but that mostly just does not happen. It is too easy for a guy like that to get a post up or inside look off an [offensive rebound](https://youtu.be/ckEIHFR2GTM), [screening actions](https://youtu.be/ckEIHFR2GTM) or [beating the defense up the floor](https://youtu.be/ckEIHFR2GTM). Yes, you can double him, but it is not so simple especially as a series goes on. If the Raptors managed to stifle [this action](https://youtu.be/ckEIHFR2GTM), the same as before, they would perhaps be the first team to do so consistently. The Cavs killed teams doing versions of this with love and Korver. You can see they do send a ton of help, but stopping stuff like this is really hard. Teams learn the patterns and tendencies, and ultimately talent generally speaks above all at the end. The team with more stuff that you can't stop often wins. Besides, Davis isn't Embiid and you can't rely on him to consistently miss the open guys.   &amp;#x200B;  I don't know anything about Siakam guarding playoff Lebron. The Lakers will be fine going inside to Davis on a post up against either of the two wings or having Lebron attack Gasol or Ibaka off the dribble. While the Raptors help a lot, I expect to try to find some combination of guys to ultimately just switch that pick and roll. I'd expect less and less helping off of quality shooters in the corners as the series went on, at least with Green.      The playoffs are a different animal. It has become harder and harder to hide not only bad defenders, but also guys who can't shoot reliably on offense. It is not nearly as simple as saying OG isn't being relied on to score. Everyone in the playoffs is relied on to create or finish offense in some manner or they're taking something off the table. A lot of the time that means knocking down shots. The same way teams will help off a guy like Kuzma, they will help off OG and see if he can make enough shots in the playoffs to punish them for it.      My problem with Lowry and FVV as playoff scorers is their shooting dependency. Generally they are not going to take you off the pick and roll and destroy you at the basket. A ton of their value is being able to hit shots in that action or draw the defense in before passing out. That stuff is easier to defend 2 vs 2 in the post season. Maybe they end up shooting so well, like they ended up doing at times last year towards the end of the post season, but that is not something I would probably count on.      Player of the week does not mean anything. But Norm has shot well this season, perhaps over his head some. I don't know. Ibaka, Gasol, a lot of these guys can hit shots, pitch in some, I agree. Gasol's willingness and ability to try to stretch the Lakers two big lineup would be important. But it starts with what elite level creation you have and then moves to play finishing. I don't believe they have enough for this matchup.        I'm not using the above clips to take too much about the matchup. The Raptors do help, but you're not helping off Danny Green on the strong side over and over. Guys who played in that game probably won't play or will play less time. If Kuz doesn't provide a ton on offense or transform into a different player, I don't see him playing as much or finishing. Rondo probably won't or at least shouldn't play much. KCP and Bradly are not terrible defenders this year. I don't know where you are getting from. Just as the Raptors were 2nd in defensive rating, the Lakers were 3rd for a reason, those guys contributed to a really good defense. Comparing KCP and Bradly to Rondo is ridiculous. As much because those guys are good as it is because Rondo is absolutely terrible on that end.      The main advantage I see them having is coaching and the Lakers have not created a ton of threes this season. But the latter probably changes in the playoffs if AD plays more center."

"This post is about a single game, and says those guys have never had a game that bad. Yes they did, and it was not legacy-defining at all. When I think of LeBron James, 2011 is not the first thing that comes to mind.  Maybe I'm taking the post too literally."
To me being the best player ever at your position is hugely important. My personal top 5 is who I would consider the best at their position. My most controversial choice is at Center. I think your level of competition and how much you dominate play a part.   1. Michael Jordan   2. Magic Johnson   3. LeBron James  4. Tim Duncan   5. Shaquille O’Neal   6. Wilt Chamberlain   7. Larry Bird   8. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   9. Bill Russell   10. Kobe Bryant

"&gt; The List Of NBA All-Stars That Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant And LeBron James Have Eliminated From The Playoffs In Their Conference      This is the actual headline of the article. And maybe they are limiting it to being an All-Star in that particular season. That's some evasive technicality. But LBJ and AI never played a single playoff series against each other."
"I mean, Kobe's what-ifs are ""What if Kobe didn't choke in the 2004 and 2008** finals"".  Wade's are ""What if Wade isn't injured up 3-2 in the ECF"" and ""What if LeBron James could muster up just 5 total more points through 4 games of a finals series where he averaged 17ppg""   Seems to me that they're a bit different."
"But they lost. And even if you ignore that, he lost in 2016. Thats 4 years ago.   Raptors were not an underdog team. They weren't favored with a healthy Warriors team but they never faced that. It took Kawhi and the Raptors 6 game to defeat a hobbled Warriors team. If they would have faced the same Warriors that LeBron did, they would have lost. However, you can only face what is in front of you and this is pretty much just comparing teams.  The numbers show who the better player is in the playoffs.....Lebron James."
"I don't understand your point. The Mavericks didn't have some ultra complex defensive scheme on LeBron where its unfathomable that he'd eek out an extra few points in game 2 and 4 off of just some better luck alone. LeBron went 2-7 from 3 in game 2. One of those happens to go in, and the Heat go up 3-0 in the series. James played historically below his average level of play in 2011, and the Heat were still 5 points away from sweeping you. I think that proves that Wade would've led the Heat over the Mavs. LeBron didn't even play to the level of ""solid 2nd option on a championship team"""

"And maybe you're wrong with your evaluation process.      LeBron James has been his team's playmaker for his entire career while Bird played a great deal of off-ball basketball. Translation, passing wouldn't necessarily show up in box score numbers if you are not directly comparing two similar play makers.      https://backpicks.com/2018/01/11/backpicks-goat-11-larry-bird/      &gt; Bird was the greatest touch-for-touch passer in NBA history. There have been entire highlight videos devoted to this, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CExjzyTRxnQ&amp;t=42s   Bird was abnormally aggressive with his passing. Because of this, so many of his dishes unearthed high-percentage offense for teammates that few players could ever find, even when nothing seemed to be there.   They’ve never tracked “outlet layup assists,” but if they did, I imagine Bird would be near the top of the leader board. This passing, combined with strong scoring, made him a top-notch creator for his time — his Box Creation seasons land him between the 95th and 98th percentile historically, despite individual creation being less prominent in the early ’80s.   Bird was also the best off-ball forward ever, so much so that I’d classify his game as primarily off-ball. Watching him without the rock, particularly in the first (1980-83) and second trimester (1984-88) of his career is a study in advantageous positioning. Here’s a 30-second sample of Bird spinning, cutting, banging, boxing and constantly threatening the defense with his high-motor perpetual motion:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwjRoHyheBU   Bird’s passing was so good out of the gate that Rick Barry — a great distributor himself — called him the best passer in the league during one telecast. Longtime AP basketball columnist Alex Sachare wrote this at the end of the ’80 season:   ""In Boston, the key man in the Celtics’ remarkable turnaround has been Larry Bird. His passing game helped the Celtics more than double last year’s 29 victories…While his scoring and rebounding certainly helped, the attitude he instilled was the most vital factor in the Celtics’ renaissance. [An MVP vote] for either Erving or Bird would certainly be reasonable.""   Still, all-time level passing is perhaps the most additive and scalable skill in basketball. The worst offense Bird ever played on was about 2 points better than league average. After 1984, all of his teams were at least 4 points better than average on offense with him in the lineup (87th percentile in the 3-point era). He led the NBA in estimated creation in 1987 and his combination of scoring and playmaking pegs him as one of the greatest offensive weapons ever.   The chart below reflects Bird’s effect as a creator and passer — every single teammate declined substantially in scoring efficiency without him, particularly McHale:   https://www.backpicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Celtics-without-Bird-1989.png"
"I don't think the Clippers have enough to deal with James and Davis.  George is not enough as a 2nd option, imo. And, frankly, compared to LeBron, Kawhi may not be enough as a first option."
LeBron needs to win a ring without James Jones for anyone to take him seriously.
"I agree that longevity is Kobe's main claim over Wade. Its what led to his rings. His ability to play at an all time level for over a decade.  However, I'd argue that, there is a very possible world in which nothing about Wade's play changes, and he ends his career with 5 rings with 3 FMVPs on 6 finals appearances, only losing one once he got old. He also would've accomplished this with 2 years of his prime eaten away by injury, and in less overall time than Kobe. That would give him a very strong argument against Kobe IMO. Obviously that didn't happen, but I think, while still a bad argument, my point is beefed up by the fact that I'm not just saying ""if he could stay healthy"" and assuming he'd have a great career like you'd have to for Tmac, Hill, or Hardaway. Wade was up 3-2 in the ECF against a team that took the champions to 7 in the finals, then he got injured. Then he went and carried his team the next year. Wade was a lot more likely to win a ring given one injury being erased, than Hill, Penny, or Tmac would've been given their entire health restored. We never got the chance to see Hill, Penny, or Tmac really go for a championship in their primes. (Penny was young in 95). Its a lot bigger of a what-if than ""If Wade doesn't go down while up 3-2 in the ECF while averaging 30ppg he'd make the finals with a good chance at a ring"". In a similar vein, Wade was the best player on the court in the 2011 finals, and the Heat were 5 points away from sweeping. Wade's GOAT-tier teammate LeBron James averaged 17.2 ppg with 6 assists per game through the first 4 games. ""If LeBron averaged basically anything more than the measly 17ppg that he did, Wade wins a FMVP and ring"" im a little high and definitely rambling a bit, so I hope that makes sense?"
"and after all that, his worst call was still a 5 second back to the basket violation on lebron james in the 2011 finals  that has never been called in the PLAYOFFS in NBA history, only gets called about once every 100 regular season games  and he called it in the 4th quarter of game 5 (i think)"
"I'm pretty sure the Grizzlies were in the playoffs longer than Lebron's lakers rofl, Lebron had to activate his ""playoff mode"" to barely be a handful of games from not making the playoffs.  Leonard was winning 60+ in the West while James was struggling to get 50 in the East."
"Parker was injured dude, he barely played 19 mins in game 7 against OKC, Miami targeted him like a wounded animal as he became the worst defender in recent finals history with his injury.  Duncan was literally 38, what reality you living in?    When Kawhi wasn't guarding LBJ, LBJ exploded for 15 first quarter points, Miami took the lead and looked as dominant as ever.    When Kawhi got switched on him LBJ scored 3pts from the early 2nd Qtr to 4:40 in the 3rd and MIA was getting blown the fuck out by 21.  Do you not see the difference Kawhi makes?  Same shit happened last year with Giannis, Raps were down 0-2 when Kawhi wasn't on Giannis, Nurse makes the switch, Raps go 4-0,  It's like how many times this gotta happen?  You really think Danny Green and Boris Diaw are capable of guarding Lebron James or is it Kawhi Leonard?"
Lebron James - most minutes played without turnover: regular-season - 47 (2009) playoffs - 44 (twice in 2011)
"Bro, you ain’t dumb, right? You know that when players go to team with other stars, the individual stats go down.   Besides Jordan, only 4 times has someone lead the league in scoring and won the title. Lebron James and Bosh  stats dropped as they went to the heat. Kobe scores 35ppg with an average team but 28ppg on his championship teams (minus Shaq). Jordan scores 37 and 35ppg early in his career than 29-32ppg in the championship teams.   KG saw his stats decline tremendously when he went from T’Wolves to    Celtics. 22pts 13reb 4ast to 19pts 9reb 3ast"

"It's all subjective. If you, personally, don't find arguments compelling for LeBron, then that is A-Okay.   It doesn't make you right.   It doesn't make you wrong.   It doesn't make them right.   It doesn't make them wrong.   What matters to you matters to you. What matters to someone else is (pikachu face) different.   ""Michael Jordan is the GOAT"" and ""LeBron James is the GOAT"" are both bad statements, because there is no *fact* here.   ""I think Michael Jordan is the GOAT"" and ""I think LeBron James is the GOAT"" are better. You are voicing your *opinion* on a *subjective* matter."
Give wall LeBron James let’s see
"all hypothetical things that you can NOT prove.. lol curry doesnt even get the same defensive attention that harden and lebron get simply because the warriors have and had snipers everywhere. You dont think james harden could shoot 50 percent if durant and klay thompson were on the court with him. Back in 2012 when harden played with durant and westbrook harden had a 66% TS, shot 40% from 3, and nearly 50% from the field. Like i said before if harden is on the court with snipers like durant and klay their is only so much the defense can take away. Curry has 1 or 2 maybe 3 good to atg seasons the rest are nothing special or incomplete due to injuries, harden has like 5 straight historic seasons with a 33 yr old cp3 as his best running mate thats why his similarity score matches up with atg's and harden doesnt even have a ring. When harden gets a ring his similarity score is gonna shoot up even higher. Hardens career matches jerry west and oscar robertson the most according to basketball reference. No other current player in the nba has a current match to oscar robertson"
Uh what? LeBron James?
Even if Davis outplays James a championship would keep Lebron on top because the only guys close enough to Lebron to dethrone him would need a championship themselves to do it imo
How hard was it to defend  LeBron James and how hard was it to make a game plan to stop him.
For me  1. Michael Jordan 2. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 3. Lebron James 4. Kobe Bryant 5. Tim Duncan
"Lebron has only beaten Kawhi once in the last 4 years, how tf is he better?  Are you going by career achievements?  Cause head to head Kawhi murders him, and KD lol, he don't belong in the conversation with either man, he couldn't dethrone James, that was Kawhi."
No top 5 player has lost with more pieces than Lebron. He underachieved. Jalen Rose among others also believe he's not top 5.  Most of this subreddit only know an era with Lebron James in it so I don't expect most to agree with me on this. Good thing I don't care.
"Since 1980, only seven players averaged at least 22 points and 4.5 assists over the first five years of their career: Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Damian Lillard &amp; Devin Booker. Booker is the only player out of those seven to not lead his team to 50 wins/40 wins/30 wins/the playoffs in any of his first 5 seasons.   Booker is a nice young player, but he doesn't belong in the same conversation as any of those guys."
"LeBron????  He averaged 26.7/6.4/7.6 with 2 steals &amp; 1.3 blocks per game in that series and went for 45/5/6 in nearly 47 minutes in game 7 in Boston.  That was also the same series as the ""LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE"" dunk.  He did this against what was, at that point, the best defensive team in the history of the NBA.  The Celtics did as well as you could on LeBron, but he was not ""atrocious"" in that series.  And in game 7, I was fucking terrified of him (rightly so)"
"I understand that. I realize my arguments are too hypothetical to give Wade an argument over Kobe. I literally started my post with that. However, while was was an unlucky break or two away from 1 ring on 5 finals appearances, he was also a lucky break  or two away from having 5 rings with 3 FMVPs. Dwyane Wade doesn't get injured while ahead 3-2 in the ECF, and LeBron motherfucking James puts up more than 17ppg in the first 4 games of the finals and that happens. I'd argue that's the closest any player is to a massively increased legacy. You could also argue he's very close to a massively decreased legacy. My point is that between Wade's higher peak, and his bad luck in '05 and '11, Wade was a lot closer to Kobe than people think, and accolades don't really mean that much."
"&gt;I don't believe Lebron would go 6-0 because of what I saw in 2011   Ok sure...  Which one of the years does LeBron lose then?   [https://ca.nba.com/news/the-last-dance-did-michael-jordan-or-lebron-james-face-tougher-competition-in-the-playoffs/ub0a1xhfjsff1kuizb90rbd7y](https://ca.nba.com/news/the-last-dance-did-michael-jordan-or-lebron-james-face-tougher-competition-in-the-playoffs/ub0a1xhfjsff1kuizb90rbd7y)   Which year does LeBron lose? Every team Jordan faced in his first 3-peat was worse than any of LeBron's opponents (in fact, Jordan's first 4 finals oppenents were worse than any team Lebron faced in the finals).  &gt; and I believe Jordan wins in 2016.   You have LeBron redo '16 and he doesn't win. 2016 was an anomaly.  Anyone who confidently says Jordan or anyone else could repeat it, betrays their homerism. No one could redo 2016, not even LeBron..."
"Wilt Chamberlain, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Dr J, Kareem Abdul Jabbar ect are much better than Jordan or LeBron James."
Sorry if I hurt your feelings but I'll stand on my least controversial opinion.  Second least controversial opinion.  Duncan &gt; Lebron James
Lebron James is balding.
&gt; LeBron James is one of the best power-dunkers.  Hold your horses... Xavier McDaniel is on the line.
LeBron James is one of the best power-dunkers.
"Come on. We all know the NBA is predetermined and they’re not actually scoring those baskets. You think Lebron’s name is actually ‘Lebron James’? It’s his court name. His name is actually James Williams and he’s from Louisiana. That whole Cleveland storyline was made up going into the draft to draw support from the home crowd. Basketball is fake, grow up."
"Hopefully peak LeBron gets a little more into shooting from behind the arc, but Bird is also a solid threat from 3 off the bench. Moving to a rotation like Steph/MJ/Bird/James/Kareem would be deadly too.  If you had to make one swap, what would it be?"
"So who posted this first, you or \[this guy\]( [https://fadeawayworld.net/2020/05/25/chauncey-billups-is-the-only-player-who-has-a-winning-record-against-michael-jordan-kobe-bryant-and-lebron-james/](https://fadeawayworld.net/2020/05/25/chauncey-billups-is-the-only-player-who-has-a-winning-record-against-michael-jordan-kobe-bryant-and-lebron-james/) )?"
"Shaq is not the same player in all contexts. Over the course of his career, yes, broadly you can say he is the same player, but his advantages and disadvantages  shifted. Yes, he was a strong guy, but not every Shaq was as strong as Shaq at his heaviest. Not every Shaq could run the floor the same way. Young Shaq was more mobile, but did not read the game as well and his fundamentals were not as good. LA Shaq was not always an above average defender and certainly wasn't and wouldn't be one in all contexts.      We do this thing where we talk about players and teams squashing modern competition to the point that they actually struggled more in real life than they do in the hypothetical. Shaq struggled with floor spacing on the defensive end in his own time. The Lakers did not always win in their own time. Yes, the teams carried more centers specifically to match up with Shaq, but the issues for Shaq on defense were real. On offense, yes, he might have a better time. But if these teams are sacrificing where you were not going to stop him anyway and attacking him where he was actually at a meaningful disadvantage, that would mean something. The floor spacing would be important. It is not just the obvious stuff with his mark being able to shoot or Shaq's team having to play with the matchups, modern teams have more stuff to take advantage of slower defensive bigs. Everyone struggles to guard Lebron James surrounded by shooters, but it wouldn't even matter? Even if you think Shaq would dominate on offense, he's still going against one of the other best players ever and another top player in Wade depending on what year you are using. Matchups matter, but Shaq isn't doing better against worse teams from his own day than a Lebron James great team. Especially not with some of his weaknesses being highlighted more."
"&gt;Player You Secretly Wish was On Your Team: LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers  B-but I thought players didn't want to play with LeBron"
"LMAO. All those guys you mention were traded. Hell, KG even refused to be traded. Also KG and Allen were both past their primes. Lebron took it further by taking a pay cut and leaving Cleveland with nothing. It look even worse when lebron actually started discussion to team up with wade in 2006. Not only wade but melo as well. As a sports fan I hate what lebron created. It's not fair to small market team.  https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/carmelo-anthony-lebron-james-dwyane-wade-heat-heatles-trio-friendship-brotherhood/qsru5q6x2jnv1snzbl9g97pcp"
"I just remember that one time (I think in 2017), when way too many players didn't vote for Lebron James and Kevin Durant for the all star voting."
"We've watched Lebron play huge minutes in the playoffs as the primary creator on teams lacking in a ton of creators. It is really hard to defend a Lebron led offense while not giving shooters space. It takes elite defense to be able to both defend Lebron competently at the point of attack and to be able to rotate the way James' abilities force you to rotate. Last year's Raptors team and those Warriors Lebron played against could move around like demons on defense, but I'm not sure the Raptors match up as well this year. They can do that defensively, perhaps, but not without sacrificing some on offense.  If I had to guess, I would guess the Raptors won't be able to defend the pick and roll 2 vs 2. Maybe they just switch it, but there are questions about that on both ends. If you can't defend that with just the two defenders directly engaged in the action, you have to bring in the weakside help, you have to come off shooters and get into rotation. Maybe against the two big men lineups that will happen often enough, but probably not against the 4 out spacing when they go to AD at center. These lineups with Lebron surrounded by shooters have always been great offensively. I don't understand quite what you mean by help from both sides. Lebron and these Lakers are very much capable of shredding double teams out of post ups and Lebron is obviously capable of doing so in the pick and roll. Are you saying the Raptors would help off the strong side shooter?  On the other end, I think they could struggle to score against some Lakers lineups. They're capable of putting lineups out there which might stand up against LA, but if those lineups can't be trusted to score they would maybe have to go away from that. Will OG hit enough shots in the playoffs? They've covered Kawhi's role on the team from last year to some degree, but I'm still not sure they have enough perimeter creation to beat the best teams. LA does matchup well with them there with good defenders at the guard spots. Toronto has that as well, but the Lakers don't rely on so much on ball creation from their guards. The Raptors have been better in transition, but the Lakers are actually really good there too and the game does traditionally slow down in the playoffs. What the Lakers do in transition with Lebron, Davis and Green might be even harder to take away in a playoff setting. The Raptors have more depth as well, yes, but stars win in the playoffs.     I think Green is a question. When so much of what you do is shooting, sometimes it can look bad when those shots don't fall even if you're still providing the spacing. I could see the scenarios in which the Lakers don't play him as much down the stretch even though I think they should over a guy like Kuzma."
Lebron James
"1. MKG was our primary defender on guys like Westbrook Harden Wall Lebron Carmelo for years. His best skill might not be that ISO defender but he’s very good at it.  2. If great defender=someone who can guard Lebron or Kawhi I’d take like Jerami Grant, Wilson Chandler, James Johnson or Marcus Morris over most guys I just mentioned. I flat out don’t really want Covington or George orSmart trying to get a stop on a guy like Kemba Walker late game.  3. Harrell not an elite defender. Not even a good defender. Barely average, especially at C. What’s he even good at? Not great in space(fine not great), bad at protecting the rim.  4. MKG would have no issues guarding Kawhi as well as really anyone else in the league, but Bron used to abuse him, he’d hit all those Lefuckyou 3s anyway even when MKG was stopping his dribble penetration."
Seems like you still doubt the media giving him that [nickname](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/05/30/origin-lebron-james-chosen-1-tattoo). Both can be true—he helped hype himself thus leading to harsher criticism AND he would have been harshly criticize regardless of getting the tattoo or not since he was selling out games to 16K people at 16 years old on National Television while the NBA was desperate for a new MJ-like superstar.
"In 2016 I knew **nothing** about sports much less the NBA, and the 4 NBA players whose names I knew were Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Shaquille O'Neal."
PG - Stephen Curry  SG - Michael Jordan  SF - LeBron James  PF - Dirk Nowitski  C - Shaquille O’Neal  6th - Kobe Bryant
"I think Lebron may be able to run up and down for 45 minutes enough to win. It’s Lebron, he’s older, but it’s still Lebron. Doubting his stamina in the playoffs isn’t the idea I would want to hold myself to as the reason the Lakers lose.   We just have to keep their confidence low is a really simplified way of saying you have to find a way to guard Lebron 1 vs 1 or the pick and roll 2 vs 2. Otherwise, it’s a matter of whether guys like KCP and Green hit the shots Lebron creates. But “make sure their confidence doesn’t get high” isn’t a strategy or tactic. If guarding Lebron is an issue, then guarding the other guys is an issue because a ton of what James does is create for others out of isolation and pick and roll."
Absolutely he's LeBron James
"Curry - Klay Thompson - LeBron - Larry Bird - Arvydas Sabonis - Kevin Garnett  Curry - GOAT shooter and best off ball player in NBA history. We will have to scheme defensively in order to hide Curry, but his offense outweighs the defensive issues  Klay - top 5 off ball player in NBA history, but is the best defender of the great off ball shooters  LeBron James - a top 5 passer in NBA history, but combines it with scoring to a level that the others didn't. Would benefit from the spacing provided by the other four players to drive whenever he needed to, plus would be great at finding Curry and Klay off screens. Can defend really well different positions when need be  Larry Bird - Underrated off ball plus can space the floor. One of the best quick passers which could work great for setting up Curry and Klay and can get his shot if he needs still. Also solid defender  Arvydas Sabonis - 7'3"" center who could take threes, play inside, and a great passer. Also can protect the rim. Underrated because his prime was in Europe  Kevin Garnett - One of the best defenders ever, and IMO the best defender that can stretch the floor (shot 45% on long twos and I think that if his career was shifted a few years in the future, he'd have a good three point shot) and guard the perimeter and paint well"
Lebron James
"&gt;  3 of those 4 seasons you're trying to give Lebron a pass for, his team were top 3 title favorites  of course they were, they had LeBron James on those teams..."
"That'd be like if James Wiseman said that now about lebron. Can you imagine if Duncan had said this in the social media era i can see the nephews of r/nba furiously typing away ""unproven piece of crap thinks he can come at the king forget about lebron hes gonna get ruined by washed melo"". He'd have gotten destroyed in public. And even if he was a good player people would still hate him 6 years after he made the comment just cause thats how things are today"
"It clearly does matter if you're doing so much research about the matter.      If your whole argument is to dismiss Lebron's achievements while wholy accepting the Warriors as the better team, than there's no point in arguing at all. No matter what I say, you're going to find something to see me as the wrong one.      See I don't get you at all. You twist the stats to say Lebron shot 48%TS for the series, but you perfectly accept Steph's 5/23 game as an off-game. You're not even citing the right series, Looney wasnt in the 2015 run. Remember the 2015 run, where Lebron had no help other than Kyrie in the first game? That 2015 run, where Lebron shot 48% TS, and Curry averaged 58% TS? You know, that 2015 run, where Lebron's next best player was Tristan Thompson? Where they played James Jones in all 6 games? LIKE WHO THE FUCK IS JAMES JONES?! If you didnt' know, James Jones is Lebron's running mate, stuck with him after the Heats days, and won 3 championships because of it.      You can quote as many numbers as you want, but we both know the best player on both teams. This isn't an argument, this is the truth. Lebron single-highhandedly carried that team to 2 wins, when on paper they shouldn't have won even a single game. The fact that they won 2 games is a miracle in and of itself."
You messed up. I surmise from your username that you're actually LeBron James using a burner account.
"Davis has played with good players before. He needs someone better than him to win. There aren't that many people in the league to begin with.  Let's say you bring in someone better in free agency. That's anywhere between 75 to 80 million in salary between two players. You've got 35 million to spend on the rest of your team if it hasn't already been locked up.   You've got two great stars and the rest of the cap is probably locked up already. You need to fill out your team, what do you do? Olddddd veterans on minimum deals and G League players. LeBron James is only one of a handful of active players who make the players around him better. Your star free agent may not do that. Now you have two stars on a team that is top heavy as shit to quote the Lakers very own LeBron James.  Trade assets? What do you have exactly? Did you give up picks for Davis? Nearly all the roster loses value without LeBron as he makes them better.   Can you draft stars from #14 to #18? Absolutely. Will they have an immediate impact? Absolutely not. They'll need 3 to 4 years to develop. Injury prone Davis will be 30 by then and it's pretty high risk to gamble on a couple of picks developing into stars in that time frame to start with...."
"No shit it was trash efficiency. Do you think the Warriors are going to double/triple LeBron James in a zone, or tightly guard Iman Shumpert? That's why having just one other reliable scorer there would have helped - it would have removed defensive pressure on LeBron from the #1 defensive team in the league."
"Outside the US it seems to me that Kobe made a splash, but Jordan was and is a legit transcendent phenomenon.  Basketball is not big at all where I am but I’ve seen a few guys recently wearing Jordan tees and obviously the shoes were the shit back then whether or not you knew what a basketball is.  By comparison LeBron barely registered, you rarely see anyone with NBA gear but when you do it’s never, ever James.  Probably the overwhelming majority of people here have no idea who he is, but for sure he hasn’t come close to gaining mainstream recognition here the way Jordan and to a lesser extent Kobe did.  Can only speculate as to why, but probably it comes down to the fact that his public persona is bland and corny, with nowhere near the charisma of Jordan or Kobe, but fundamentally he doesn’t win enough to make up for it.  An audience that isn’t all that in to basketball to start with needs to see concrete proof that this guy is all that before they buy in.  Basically imho he blew his chance of being the next global superstar when he lost to the Mavericks in 2011."
It's so surreal to watch LeBron James decision be seen as less and less bad as the years go on. I wonder what the next thing to happen will be for KD to start getting less hate too. Maybe just time.
"Do you think that LeBron James was actually predicting 8 championships in Miami? Like I said earlier, if you’re one of the idiots that actually believes that then I don’t know what to tell you."
"Here’s Bill Simmons’ moment, absolutely convinced his Celtics were going back to the Finals in 2012:  *“I don’t know what happened. I just know the shots wouldn’t stop going in. After about the fifth dagger in a row (he made 10 straight), the crowd started groaning on every make — shades of Philly’s Andrew Toney ripping our hearts out 30 years ago. If you’ve ever been in the building for one of those games, you know there isn’t a deadlier sound. He single-handedly murdered one of the giddiest Celtics crowds I can remember. Thirty points in the first half. Thirty! All with that blank look on his face.* ***It was like watching surveillance video of a serial killer coldly dismembering a body and sticking the parts in the fridge. Only we were right there.***  *You can’t imagine what this was like to witness in person.* ***I know Michael Jordan had similarly astonishing games, and others, too, but not with stakes like that. This wasn’t just an elimination game. This was LeBron James’s entire career being put on trial … and it only took an hour for him to tell the jury, “Go home.*** *I’m one of the best players ever. Stop picking me apart. Stop talking about the things I can’t do. Stop holding me to standards that have never been applied to any other NBA player. Stop blaming me for an admittedly dumb decision I never should have made. Stop saying I’m weak. Stop saying that I don’t want to win. Stop. Just … stop.”*  ***As a Celtics fan, I was devastated. He ruined what should have been a magical night. We never really had a chance to cheer, swing the game, rally our guys, anything. He pointed a remote control at us and pressed ‘MUTE.’ It was like being in a car accident. LeBron James ran over 18,000 people.****”*"
"They were winning before Kawhi, they kept winning during Kawhi load management games, they are still winning after Kawhi left.   How quickly people forget the Raptors were a good team that simply lost three straight years to Lebron James.   This notion that Kawhi is the only reason they won is vastly overrated."
"He was just one of the examples that I used to show how important coaching is to winning it all. But I don't think there are a lot of current NBA coaches who could do the job Billy is doing. MJ didn't want to play for anyone but Phil, because he loved Phil, so much. Those dynasty's wouldn't of happen without him. He also got everything Kobe had and more. Coaching is huge there is a reason pat Riley didn't let LeBron James bully Eric spolstra out the door, he's been doing a hell of job keeping Miami going and is one of the main reason Jimmy Butler came to Miami."
"In 3 years let's assume LeBron is no longer the best SF. He'll be 37/38 years old, maybe he's the best still but let's go with Kawhi.  |Position|USA|Europe| |:-|:-|:-| |Center|Anthony Davis or KAT|Nikola Jokic| |Power Forward|Kevin Durant? Zion?|Kristaps Porziņģis| |Small Forward|Kawhi Leonard|Giannis Antetokounmpo| |Shooting Guard|James Harden|Dennis Schröder?| |Point Guard|Steph Curry|Luka Dončić|  It's close, I think team Europe will have the edge in 2 possibly 3 of these positions (Luka, Giannis and Jokic) but Europe just has very few elite guards. They may win 3/5 positions but the 2 they don't win they lose pretty badly. If Porziņģis continues to develop and becomes a 25/10 guy (his numbers to close out the season) it becomes a heck of a lot closer, but I think the gap between Fournier/Schröder/Bogdanovic and Harden is just too big to overcome.  Team Europe will need an all star caliber guard to win IMO. Now if you factor in depth, team USA wins pretty easily.  EDIT: now if you include this to be international stars not just team Europe, you now have Joel Embiid, Pascal Siakam and Ben Simmons. Team International faces the same problem, they are comparable starting 5 wise but are pretty top heavy and don't have the depth that team USA has."
"You think Lebron right now isn't as popular as Kobe was in the early 2000's?  Jordan was definitely super popular in the 90's, but to act like Lebron James with his billion dollar shoe contract, his roles in movies including reprising Jordan's role in Space Jam 2, his social media numbers isn't as popular as Jordan was is really looking at the past through rose coloured glasses and dismissing the present."
"Sixers face the Celtics no matter what and I'm down for this. Either we get revenge on Kawhi or he donkey punches us, to potentially the Giannis/Bucks matchup we were looking for if we had gotten past Toronto, and of course it would still run against LeBron James and the Lakers. Some dude on r/eagles said how beating Brady in his best statistical game in the Super Bowl made it that much more sweet than beating the Jaguars would (though a first Super Bowl is great in any format). Beating LeBron in a way where he averages a 30 point triple double would be insane.  I'd be grateful to watch those series as an invested fan, especially in these times we live in."
"Mike Brown is one of the best defensive minded coaches of all time.  The issue wasn't Mike, but the total lack of a roster for him to work with. His best player was Lebron James.  Give that man Corey Brewer and he will give you back to back championships."
My top 5.  1) Kobe Bryant 2) LeBron James 3) Michael Jordan 4)  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 5) Magic Johnson
"Fixed it. MVP: LeBron James DPOY: Draymond Green Series: Spurs vs Heat, 2013 Game: Game 7 2016 Finals Shot: Ray Allen  Coach: Pop Trade: Celtics Nets --- (Most Infamous, obviously not most successful) Signing: KD to Warriors"
"That's not confusing at all. He thinks that LeBron has a better all-around skill set than Jordan, but that Jordan's various accolades and especially his 6 rings give him a significant edge over James, who still has time to close the gap if he can win another title or two before he retires."
"Lebron James, you say something wrong to you he’ll call and tell on you to the league to get you suspended.  Might even send out a tweet"
JJ in 2011 Finals was iconic. A 5’10 guy was locking down prime Lebron James.
"Whether or not you believe Jordan had direct control over the documentary is one thing, but saying that it wasn't a ""propaganda film"" is straight up untrue. This sub has never pushed the ""Jordan is GOAT!"" narrative half as hard as they have these last couple weeks. It's been non-stop since this documentary aired, and you don't think that was by design?  People are unironically making Top 5 lists excluding Lebron James and sending death threats to Channing Frye because they're getting so gung ho over this doc."
If they can afford to have the Knicks being consistently garbage for 20 years they can afford the fucking New Orleans Pelicans not making the playoffs in Zion’s second year.  God forbid they have to rely on mediocre money spinners like LeBron James of the Lakers and Steph Curry of the Warriors to get paid.
Honestly at this point I think each era has it's on goat. Each goat contender was ridiculously good and there is too much luck and differences between eras.   For example individual skill the goat of the 60s was Wilt. If your looking at who won due to a way better team and coach it was Russel.  In the 1970s to 1980. Well I would say kareem. Still leads in scoring and even Magic Johnson another goat defers to him. He did in interviews. Has the skyhook a shot so difficult and impossible to block only he has managed to do it.   But Basketball wasn't that popular during the 1960s nor was Kareem as media friendly or savvy as Michael Jordan  and  Magic Johnson.  I feel like Larry was perhaps the unluckiest goat contender. He seriously messed up his back. Was still a goat in other players opinion from the interviews. Would have been much better athletically if his back wasn't broken.   Magic Johnson career got cut short due to STDs and in that sense he was unlucky. But he got to play under a great team. A great coach and with a fellow goat. He is the player who got me into basketball.  Much easier conference than Larry.  Larry had a very hard conference and had to go against two goats. Was clutch incarnate than any other goat ever.  So in terms of skill I feel like larry was better like 10 percent to 5 percent. Since he was able to keep up with that broken back and slow speed which was a result of that back. Had to beat two goats to win chips at times.  Magic in terms of popularity and accolades.   1990s belonged to Jordan. He is responsible for what basketball is nowadays. He is as skilled as any other player. But his goat status for many is actually through branding and him having a good deal of luck on his side more than magic with a lot of variables.   In terms of skill I think he is the most versatile and complete scorer of all time. But Kareem is the most effective  scorer of all time. The stats don't lie.  His team had only two less wins without him. So he didnt elevate them to victory. On average the rest team dropped 10 to 15 games. So he did greatly help his team. But he wasn't essential. He guarantees the win but couldnt will his team to it.   Unlike Lebron Jordan was never able to lead a shit team to the playoffs.   U could argue from 2007 to 2020 lebron is the goat. In terms of skill he has constantly reinvented himself. But has had shit luck. He was not drafted into a team that would provide him good teammates. Not even a good coach like others.  Has terrible luck overall but makes any team a playoff contender by him being there.  Leading them in 2007 or 8 against the spurs.   He wasted a lot of time with the cavs. He should have ditched sooner. Lebron wasted 2011 through his own fault  that was the only year he was expected to win. The heat was good but ended soon out of injuries.  He won one for the cavs but Kyrie ditched for his own reasons in the third year. Then durant happened and that was bad for everybody.  Lebron has faced the toughest competition outside of larry. But in a worse situation than Larry most of the time with a shit team most of the time or an injured team.  He has faced Golden state of curry and kd and klay three all time greats in a five headed monster. Curry could have been a fellow goat if he didnt make his team so stacked and in terms of skill so could K.D.  Lebron went against Tim duncan. Kobe and a lot of all time greats on shit teams he lead to the play offs . When he leaves team like in the cavs case there win to loss ratio is flipped.  Lebron james is also ridiculous scrutinised and I feel like if jordan played in this era he would be scrutinised way worse.
Really? You don’t or can’t see the hypocrisy of Lebron James? Maybe you and your eye rolls are just ignorant as well.
"what an essay. you put a lot of words in my mouth, but i’m gonna respond to your edit.  powerful americans like lebron james and drew brees bear a greater responsibility to be properly informed about issues that hurt people in their own country than they do about issues across the world, because here is where their platform has the most power and can do the most good (lebron) or the most harm (drew brees). it’s far less acceptable to be ignorant about and indifferent to your neighbors being brutalized by police than it is to people in hong kong being brutalized by the CCP.  does this mean it’s ok to not give a fuck about people outside your country? no. should americans like lebron care more about hong kong than they’ve shown to? yes. but can you just equate not giving a fuck about an issue that’s hurting your fellow citizens in your own backyard (and your words can actually impact greatly) to being ignorant about issues in china? no.  EDIT: you completely misrepresented ali too. what he did was 100x more about how black people were treated in america and how particularly unjust it was to force them to go to war than it ever was about caring for vietnamese people."
"Pat Beverly &gt; Avery Bradley, Paul George &gt; Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard = LeBron James, Anthony Davis &gt; Marcus Morris, JaVale McGee = Ivica Zubac. I’d say their benches are pretty much even maybe a little edge to the Clippers with Mo and Lou but I say Clippers in 6."
"that may be, but Brees' idiocy enables evil, and should be shouted down with great vigor. case in point: Laura Ingraham's hypocrisy on her treatment of Brees, versus her stance on LeBron and KD.   [https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/06/04/lebron-james-calls-out-laura-ingraham-over-drew-brees/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/06/04/lebron-james-calls-out-laura-ingraham-over-drew-brees/)     i like Killer Mike's take much better.   [http://www.espn.com/video/clip/clip?id=29263636](http://www.espn.com/video/clip/clip?id=29263636)"
U cant. And so would argue shaq would not provide enough value. Kid and lebron can both dominate in the paint. Not as well as shaq. But can score from anywhere and don't club free throws.  James dominated. Dunks on people. When he goes driving up people will try to double team at some point. He passes it to curry or harden mid shot etc
your name is lebron james goat but you didnt even put the lakers
"Lol no they don’t. I’m not trying to bash the Celtics at all. It’s just incorrect about depth.  Starters: Magic, Kobe, Lebron, Kareem, Shaq  2nd Unit: West, Baylor, Big Game James, AD, Wilt  3rd Unit: Goodrich, Wilkes, Pau, Mikan, Dwight"
What? Lebron James is better than Michael man.
"&gt;The entire 2015 postseason. He was inefficient in every series but still played extremely well....  LeBron was not a postseason god in 2015. I do not agree with the idea that LeBron's volume made up for his extreme inefficiency when that is no excuse for his inability to hit outside shots with any degree of consistency, and there have been players in past years in similar circumstances who have managed to be far more efficient in the postseason. Allen Iverson is one of them. Of course LeBron is typically a far better scorer than Iverson, but in 2015 postseason he was not. Spacing wasn't entirely his issue (we've seen LeBron play better with limited spacing elsewhere) - he'd lost a lot of lift athletically and had lingering knee, back issues that caused him to take a two week break in January to remedy. A healthier James performs better in the postseason and separates himself from KD by a margin that is hardly comparable. Unless you want to copy paste his stats on the Warriors where he had the most support of any superstar in modern history.  &gt;That’s a simplistic way of looking at it  It is not. LeBron is quite literally on a different tier than Kevin Durant offensively because of his playmaking. This is what seperates them peak for peak. Thank god I'm about to ignore you so I don't have to hear what inane logic you use to argue to the contrary.    &gt;Well, you’re comparing a pre prime Durant to a prime Kobe physically and mentally but I’ll still entertain this.  Then use KD in 2016? Use KD in 2014? When he won MVP I wonder why you are ignoring this runs, hmm.   &gt;OKC’s best floor spacers during the KD years was Derrick Fisher and Ibaka....  You included a stretch where James Harden was on the team.  &gt;KD from 2011-2013-  &gt;29.4pts/8.8/4.4ast 61 TS 8.5 BPM  &gt;Kobe from 2008-2010-  &gt;29.7pts/5.7rbs/5.5ast 56 TS 8.0 BPM  You are deliberately ignoring where I said Kobe versus the Western Conference. You cut that part out of the quote. Your delusion continues to be impressive. His per 100 scoring rates far eclipse Durant's, his playmaking dwarfs Durant's while being far better at protecting the ball, and best of all he IMPROVES upon his RS performance while KD GETS WORSE and stagnates. 2012 is the only OKC run he ever had where he performed better than his RS self.  Notice you didn't include KD's MVP season in 2014. I wonder why? Went from a 63 TS% in the RS to a 57 TS% in the playoffs. Went from scoring 41 points per 100 to 35. But people like yourself will ignore the RS and view his playoff performance in a vacum as if he isn't clearly declining.   &gt;Ummm, From 2011 to 2016 (excluding rookie campaign) he was 29.1 pts on 58 true shooting on very high volume w/o playing in a real offensive system or with elite shooters around him.   2008 was KD's rookie campaign. What are you talking about. 2010 marked his first superstar level season; sure sounds like you're once again trying to manipulate the data to suit your narrative as you know it would damage your argument. But lets play your game. In 2011-2016 Durant is at 38.5 points per 100 possesions on 62 TS% in the RS. A lack of offensive system, lack of elite shooters didn't stop him from performing in such a way. Wasn't an excuse then.   in 2011-2016 Durant is down to 35.9 points per 100 on 58 TS%. Down from as much as +10 above league average to merely +4. Now its an excuse! KD needs more help, better support, wah wah. This is only an elite postseason performer is your bar is lowered for that distinction. If he's elite what the hell is LeBron, omega elite? Not a god, thats for sure.  Try to get some help for your internet obsession with Curry. Someone who no matter how hard you try behind your computer screen, will continue to be viewed as an all time great. As promised, putting you on ignore."
"Ya but still, it doesn't matter if he is not like the others. He done something only 1 other player done 3 different times. I am not saying he is 7th all-time if anything I think I should of put sir Oscar Robertson there or leBron James."
"90's Bulls two championship 3-peats, Kobe-Shaq's 3 peat 2001-2003, Heat big three/Heatles from 2010-2014, 2019 Raptors championship season and Kawhi's playoff performance, Derrick Rose MVP season 2011, Linsanity/Melo era Knicks mostly 2011-2014, Spurs dynasty from 2003-2007, 2004 Detroit Pistons championship season, 2015 Warriors and Steph Curry's 2016 unanimous MVP season, LeBron's 2018 playoff run, the Lob City Clippers 2012-2014, Lakers 2-straight championships 2009 and 2010, Mavs-Heat 2006 Finals, Celtics 2008 championship, OKC Finals loss, etc.  Highlights: Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, Larry Bird, Shaq, Charles Barkley, CP3, Wilt Chamberlain, Dirk Nowitzki, Steve Nash, KD, Linsanity, Spurs big 3, Celtics big 3, Heat big 3, etc.  Younger players to watch: Giannis, Devin Booker, Trae Young, Luka doncic, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, Pascal Siakam, Shai gilgeous alexander,  Zion Williamson, Bol Bol, Ja Morant, MPJ, Kendrick Nunn and Tyler Herro, Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo, etc."
"It wasn’t a second star that was needed. LeBron James gave up.   I don’t know wether it was the whole mess with Delonte West which caused team chemistry to go south or if he had just mentally checked out because he knew he was going to Miami. I’m not here to make excuses for him.   **15 Points** in Game 5. 15 points! 37 year old Shaq scored more points than LeBron. He went 0 from the 3 point line and had a FG% of .214  Quite frankly, that was the worst performance from a superstar since LeBron’s 2008 semifinals Game 1 where he put up 12 points, 9 rebounds, 9 assists, and 10 TOs  A second star wouldn’t have stopped this from happening. You could have added Amar’e or whomever you want, but when your star acts like this it’s over. He had mentally checked out. We saw this when he ripped his jersey."
"LeBron ""Literal Coach Killer"" James"
Lebron James
"Theres no way because Adam Silver said they plan on testing everybody every day. Doubt they'd let them cover it up, even if it was lebron james"
"i'd rather have otto porter, jeremy lamb, de'aaron fox and a healthy blake griffin for the price you would be getting lebron james for. 1 player is not worth $50 million"
Yeah it's not like LeBron James didn't have the N-word spray painted on the gate to his home in 2017.
"This is great but never forget that LeBron went back on his own values for money when it came to freedom for Hong Kong. [He tweeted an MLK quote ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere"" but then went in direct contradiction to that by saying what's happening in Hong Kong shouldn't be our problem...](https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2019-10-15/lebron-james-nba-china-daryl-morey-tweet-plaschke)      Again, I'm very glad he's standing up for BLM now but please keep in mind he certainly isn't a saint."
There’s also a difference between Lebron James and James Harden though
"Ya, LeBron James is a victim lol"
LeBron James hasn’t experienced the injustices of the CCP and isn’t informed on Hong Kong though he has lived in the US and experienced institutional racism his entire life
"Yeah, super cringe. I want to hear from Joe Harris regarding racism and inequality in America before Lebron James /s.     I can see this will be the thread that keeps on giving"
"I can't take Lebron James seriously after the whole ""China"" situation."
"&gt;“I think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could tweet or could say (could affect people),” James said. “We all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others, and you’re only thinking about yourself.  &gt;“I don’t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.”  He literally said that Morey wasn't educated enough to speak about the Hong Kong issue. Morey literally liked a post supporting the protestors and LeBron called him out it. FOR A FUCKING POST **SUPPORTING THE PROTESTORS**  How can you defend LeBron here?"
"&gt;He called Morey uneducated and misinformed for tweeting ""free Hong Kong.""  A few things: Morey didn't even stand by his own tweet.  Here is clarification by LeBron  https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/15/20915339/lebron-james-hong-kong-quotes-daryl-morey"
This warranted anger is going to last longer than your standard outrage (ie LeBron James comments on China) as it should.
"&gt; in fact this may be the most fair finals run ever.  Every team is healthy, even recovered from the wear and tear or regular season.  No home court advantage   I'm not sure that's the definition of fair.  I'll agree its the most even starting point, but I think organizations that have home court advantages deserve them.  I think teams that construct teams with the youth and depth for the long haul deserve to benefit.  Instead what we have is a red carpet rolled out at the feet of LeBron James."
"I did not go to business school.  You know who else didn’t go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant"
Yea I totally forgot about Wenyen “eye candy” Gabriel he’s definitely gonna out shine LeBron James
"While I agree that Drew Brees is ignorant, LeBron James only cares about himself and happens to be black. When a GM spoke for freedom for Hong Kong he called them ignorant about the situation. The man is just a douchebag with a platform."
"u really can't compare to cali and the rest of the west coast. that's like comparing bradley beal to lebron  james and deeming brad a bad player. if u ever had to try to find asian food in places like Iowa you'd know chicago has it pretty good.   As for east coast, outside of NYC, which is another no-brainers that you can't really compare too, there  is nothing special that I would put over Chicago. DC proper has shit Asian food outside a few good places."
"James said it was his belief that Morey was “either misinformed or not really educated on the situation” with the NBA and China and insisted that the Rockets general manager hadn’t properly considered the repercussions of his words. ""So many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually."" he said. (ESPN reported earlier Tuesday that James and others had lost lucrative endorsement deals and appearances as part of the fallout.)  He very clearly stated Morey wasn’t educated enough to speak on social activism in Hong Kong likely due to his concern over his endorsements as opposed to innocent lives of Hong Kong protestors. Furthermore Morey was unable to stand by his tweets due to said backlash and commentary from hypocrites like LeBron and the very real threatening of his safety and livelihood. If anything it shows how poorly LeBron was educated in regards to the entirety of the Hong Kong situation.  LeBron has had over 12 basketball camps in China and frequently travels when marketing apparel and promoting physical fitness. With the most basic lowest common denominator levels of human intelligence he should be able to recognize the levels of danger the and brutality CCP exacts upon its citizens.   Sure he is a public figure but so are countless public figures that LeBron actively encourages to speak up about global issues and injustices. We have seen countless public figures outside of the United States speak out in support of the plight of African Americans in the United States. Now imagine those same people discourages discussion of said issues and instead telling their local activists to better educate themselves first.   LeBron is the definition of a hypocrite on this one. Stand up for what you believe in... unless it pisses off China and my bottom line (Nike endorsements)  I’ve never traveled to Hong Kong either but I am able to easily discern the injustice that is going on there. Are you saying that LeBron is so dense as to not immediately recognize the brutality that is going on there?   @KingJames wrote his epitaph with, ""So just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, it can be a lot of negative that comes with it"" -  Imagine telling current protestors to be careful with what they say and tweet bc some negatives will be associated with it..."
Their current situation is the direct result of their location. I can guarantee that if the Lakers were in Memphis they wouldn't have signed LeBron James. I coulda been in Pelinka's place and the Lakers woulda still got James and Davis.
1. Sign LeBron James  2. Trade for Anthony Davis
Lebron James will infect the whole league with Corona before he misses a single goddamn minute of the finals.  That's a sacrifice he's willing to make.
"20s will be the decade of players who aren’t PGs playing like them. Luka already doesn’t start at Point for Dallas, Lebron has been playing like a point guard already for years, Giannis is usually Milwaukee’s play initiator and NOLA used both Boogie and AD as ball carriers (albeit often poorly). James Harden plays a lot like a Point Guard but spends more time at 2. Draymond Green is like a Point Power Forward and Jokic is a fucking point Center"
Yea to say everybody is in the same boat now is laughable. I'm sure LeBron James and Jayson Tatum have the same access to resources to stay in shape and on top of their game. Tatum had an interview in mid-April where he said he hadn't touched a basketball in over a month because of where he was quarantined.
"A confirmed star level wing player, an improving elite passing 2-way point guard, a decent role player, and a whole bunch of future picks that come from a team starring a 36 year old LeBron James?   Nothing to be mad about at all."
"Had to look this up, yikes: In 2017 [Racial slur sprayed on LeBron's house: 'It's tough being black in America'](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/31/sport/lebron-james-racist-graffiti-incident/index.html)"

LeBron James likes this.
it only shows: when you have the wrong opinion or view you are done..  look at Lebron James and Drew Brees.. Lebron is eating him alive while the King is sucking up to China..
"This is how it comes off.  ""Oh no. Fuck you Drew Brees for having an opinion of your own. I'm the great LeBron James and only my opinion matters."""
"Ah LeBron James, condemning US police for racism with the left hand while jerking off Chinese police with the right."
"When you’re misinformed or you’re not educated about something, and I’m just talking about the tweet itself, you never know the ramifications that can happen.  Yes, we all do have freedom of speech. But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others and you’re only thinking about yourself. I don’t want to get into a feud with Lebron James, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke.  So many people could have been harmed — not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually. Just be careful about what we tweet, what we say and what we do.

"Not a fan but I’m guessing Cleveland hates Steph Curry /KD for ruining their King’s 2nd tenure? Or do they hate Kyrie for leaving ?    As a warriors fan I really hate Lebron James for walking over and tea bagging a fallen down Draymond, inciting him to get a technical.. and after the game gave immense pressure to the league to ensure Dray gets suspended for a very important game in the NBA FINALS.   But Lebron seems loved by so many people that I’m probably wrong and gsw doesn’t hate him."
"Mate we had 22 wins last season, we still have only 22 wins this season and if we were to play the remaining 17 games I can only realistically see us winning against the Magic/Knicks, maybe shithouse another against the 76ers who can't play away games for shit  So whats that, 25 or 26 wins maybe? So a handful of wins more, meanwhile everyone on the roster except Zach Lavine have regressed as players in whatever the fuck Boylen's system is.  Knicks have Mike Miller who went 17-27 before the season shut down, I don't think he is worse than Boylen.  Cavs might have a case with Beilein, but he's already paid for that with his job.  Timberwolves have a clusterfuck of a roster and they play in the West, yes Ryan Saunders isn't a particularly good coach but the man is 34 (yes he is younger than LeBron James). Whats Boylen excuse considering he's been an assistant since Ryan Saunders was a 1-year old in fucking diapers"
"""I also don't think every issue should be everybody's problem as well.""  A real quote by Lebron James regarding China/Hong Kong specifically."
"Lebron James doesnt speak out about china, child labor, and hong kong because of money. He and the NBA only care about money."
"Oh certainly, plenty of reasons to make style choices beyond clarity. I just didn’t like this one since a) it could be read as something that was flat out wrong, that only he had held this record ever since it started being tracked b) the choice seemed deliberate for hyperbole  Here’s my pedantic suspenseful reword to keep it accurate:  “Since the stat started being tracked in 96-97, the  player with the most unassisted fields goals is: Lebron James”"
It took way too long to find this comment.   Forever: FUCK LEBRON JAMES  I'm not even a sports fan so idc about anything to do with him as a player. I care that he completely turned his back on Hong Kong protestors because he didn't want to piss off the Almighty Dollar/Renminbi.
"You can't say LeBron make his teammates better and then talk about how bad their 3 pt % is. 2018 the Cavalier locker room leaked that LeBron was hunting for assist passes rather than making passes to move the ball: https://www.google.com/amp/s/lebronwire.usatoday.com/2018/01/12/report-some-cavs-believe-lebron-james-is-assist-hunting/amp/  Not to mention LeBron receives plenty of help from the spacing, regardless of whether his teaates shoot well or not."
"i'm not sure how it is that Lebron gets to preach anything to anybody. what? other people don't believe the things that you do? (not that i agree at all with Brees, he's a dork) i understand that you have a high school education, me James, but welcome to America, Lebron. where you get to play basketball and fly around on your private jet plane. and you don't get to tell people that thir opinion does not meet your standards."
Didn't LeBron James support China when Hong Kong was protesting against them? What a hypocrite.  Also fuck Drew Brews because go bucs
LeBron lost all credibility with Hong Kong. Fuck LeBron James
remember when Lebron “daquan” James didn’t say shit about the Chinese government suppressing Hong Kong.  Fucking hypocrite baboon
"LeBron James?  You mean the LeBron James that only takes social stands when it doesn't economically impact him?  This clown doesn't get to call out anyone over anything anymore.  He might be right in this situation, but he is the king of hypocrisy when it comes to civil rights."
"The irony is that a child slave in a Chinese factory will be making the Colin Kapernick and LeBron James special edition ""sacrifice everything for equality"" Nike shoes for 5 cents, and they'll make millions off his labour and not give a single thought to it"
"Lebron James shouldn't say anything anymore. I agree with him, but after what he said about Hong Kong just to suck China's dick against protestors and then to be contradictive in America is fucking stupid"
Marc Gasol  Brook Lopez  Derrick Rose  Blake Griffin  LeBron James  Kawhi Leonard  Tony Parker

"I don't know, but the 2018 Raptors were supposed to beat the Cavs.  *""Toronto kicks off the conference semifinals as a heavy favorite (88 percent chance to win the series) over Cleveland""* \- ESPN  Cleveland wasn't supposed to have enough firepower without Kyrie and Toronto was thought to have a ""LeBron stopper.""  *""OG Anunoby gives Raptors real hope to contain LeBron James""* \- ESPN  Analytics people favored the Raptors and fans of analytics were convinced by this, so even some analytically inclined Cavs fans were predicting the Raptors winning in 6.  Crazy in hindsight.  The sweep was an eye-opener for a lot of people.  What LeBron did that year is already super underrated."

Lebron james? Mr.James who said his money was more important to the pain suffering and oppression the chinese government was inflicting on its people mr.James?
"I want to know how kneeling ""disrespects the flag.""   While we're at it I want to know the last time we waged battle for our freedom. I've literally never heard of another country make such a stink about its flag and military servicemen. Hong Kong, Syrian separatists, Vietnam, Ukraine...these are countries fighting for freedom. Fighting in the desert over the last 30 years to keep our unsavory friends perched on top of the oil baron game isn't my idea of freedom.  The last time we fought for freedom was in WW2 when, as my friend puts it, the U.S. entered the game in the 3rd quarter up 20. Maybe the reason we insecurely keep harping on this mythical fight for freedom is because it just isn't true, and we can't accept that or are too dumb to accept it.  If our military was enforcing our freedom, they'd start by pointing their guns at those banksters who profit off our debt and move the money to avoid paying taxes on it.   So much about this country is such a fucking lie. Even as kids we're taught that a bunch of farmers repelled the British Imperialists ""with an assist from the french.""   I wonder if Drew would stan this hard for the status quo if he wasn't kicking back and soaking in such a life of privilege. Even if he would, the fact that a person of LeBron James' fame and stature has been fighting this uphill battle of racial inequality, taking L after L should at the very least cause Drew to just keep that drivel to himself."
"""I am... Inevitable""  -LeBron James on making the finals"
"most athletes are on PEDs. Of course Lebron and Giannis are as well. Lebron literally needed surgery to remove a growth on his jaw line caused by HGH. These players run too much and have such high metabolisms that in order to put on size you pretty much have to juice. Lebron has also been tied to the Miami steroid clinic made famous years ago  [http://dystnow.com/2013/03/04/lebron-james-jameer-nelson-linked-to-miami-steroid-clinic/](http://dystnow.com/2013/03/04/lebron-james-jameer-nelson-linked-to-miami-steroid-clinic/)  There's simply too much competition and money involved to not put yourself in the best position to succeed via PEDs. It's also blood doping as well. Yes these sports test but it's a joke. The labs are always one step ahead of them and these sports, especially the NBA rely too much on star power to be suspending players."
"yes the self awareness in brees comments is completely absent, but lebron james is in absolutely no position to be speaking about police brutality towards ANY race when he turned his back on HK when they needed him most.  he’s no better than your average ratshit corporate entity. he will do anything to increase his profits, and do everything he can to deflect anything that will hurt his profits. including the loss of human life and liberty. he is a snake. nothing more. stop giving him credit and more importantly attention."
lebron james can shut his dumbass fucking mouth. nothing credible or noteworthy coming from that boys thoughts.  wish we still had kobe to be the voice of the nba but now this fucking sellout punk thinks he’s the new kobe.
"Alright this title gore is really getting me. You could have just said “Lebron James has the most unassisted fields goals since the stat began being tracked in 96-97.”   Instead, you wrote it in a way that’s technically incorrect. Since 96-97 a bunch of players had more unassisted field goals than LeBron James considering he wasn’t even playing until many years later. Literally 100s of players would have had more unassisted field goals than LeBron James since 96-97, just no one has more than him as of RIGHT NOW.  Grammar rant over."
"And LeBron James too for standing behind China in order to get some of that sweet sweet overseas money. LeBron is a shit just like Brees, but is great at hiding it. Behind the scenes he’s just as spoiled, greedy, and selfish. LeBron picks and chooses what he supports if it doesn’t interrupt his cash flow."
"“I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke,” James said, referring to Morey. “So many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually.”  Hahahaha, shut the fuck up you aint educated Morey. Also it hurts my money.  Lebron, the average hypocritial idiot."
Don’t care what LeBron James says.  He picks and chooses which social causes to support based on what will make him the most money.  He sided with the Chinese government with the Hong Kong protests.    You have to be consistent with defending freedom of speech and assembly but LeBron James is not.
LeBron James enters the room.
Lebron James is a complete moron and should stick to basketball...
Lebron James? He’s also an entertainer. Same as Drew.
"Sure. In the late 90s the UK turned over HK to China under the premise of one country two systems. This was meant to be upheld for decades. This was tested by a recently proposed extradition law that HKers felt threatened their autonomy, many years before the original agreement of two systems was meant to end. Resulting in peaceful protests that have carried on for nearly a year by millions of HK citizens. When it came time for those in America with influence and a platform to speak up for our values of freedom and anti-oppression, GM Daryl Morey put out a tweet in support of the protestors. Despite Morey obviously being right about supporting peaceful protests, Lebron James specifically was against it due to the belief that the issue was too complicated for members of the NBA to speak on. Which is patently false. The NBA and James stood to lose massive amounts revenue by alienating mainland China. James chose his wallet, despite being rich enough for several lifetimes, over the rights and safety of others."
"On Oct. 9, while in China for a series of exhibition games and in the midst of the crisis for the league created by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's Oct. 4 tweet of support for protesters in Hong Kong, James reportedly told NBA commissioner Adam Silver that he saw little upside in speaking up about the situation when the league wouldn't.    Lebron is a fucking hypocrite and can go fuck off. At least Brees isn’t worried about his bottom line. Lebron on the other hand..."

Remember [that time](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/what-did-lebron-james-say-about-china-nearly-everyone-else-ncna1069131) when Lebron said that supporters of the Hong Kong protests were misinformed?
LeBron is a hypocrite for this.  He embarrassed himself by saying Daryl Morey was “misinformed” and “not educated” when he supported Hong Kong protesters on social media. To me it was the biggest gaffe in James’ carefully managed career. Now he wants to pile Brees.

"I don't disagree with any of that, but it's a holistic look at it. James Dolan is happy to release statements about Oakley's 'alcoholism' which no one needed to hear or wasn't close to being required. So, just like Lebron wth China, it's funny to see him disqualify himself now."
"Like what MJ did right?   MJ was soooo outspoken about black rights when he played right?   But that’s the point, MJ is a perfect example.   During his playing days, it wasn’t safe for celebrities to support movements like BLM, and because MJ cared about this wallet, he didn’t say shit. This was a time frame where racism was MUCH worse.   Now? He speaks on it alllll the time.    Lebron James talks about human rights allll the time! But suddenly flips when his wallet is in danger?   Come on."
"To shut LeBron up, some rich Republican just needs to give him a big enough cheque.  He'll then just blame the protesters ""who just need to educate themselves"" or something.  James isn't half the man Kapernick is. He wishes he were. But nope."
"&gt;“I don’t want to get into a … feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke,” James said before the Lakers hosted the Golden State Warriors in a preseason game. “So many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually.

"No, LeBron wasn't thinking of just himself. He is the face of the NBA, whatever he said in that moment is what China would perceive the NBA is saying. Him taking a superficial stance on freedom in a situation he knows very little about is irresponsible because it'll result in a lot more people (lower level NBA employees) other than himself losing their jobs. While I'm not saying that taking a stance in support of freedom and democracy is ever wrong, he was speaking on behalf of the NBA here whether you want to acknowledge it or not. This isn't Steve Kerr or CJ McCollum, it's LeBron James, the biggest American sports icon currently. It was a move that of course protected the NBA and his money, but in the larger scheme of things, taking a stance against China does nothing for Hong Kong, the Chinese regime will still do as they please, just like they would have cut all ties to the NBA had LeBron said that and hurt the league financially immensely. Have some perspective."
" [https://dailycaller.com/2019/10/15/lebron-james-nba-adam-silver-daryl-morey/](https://dailycaller.com/2019/10/15/lebron-james-nba-adam-silver-daryl-morey/)   &amp;#x200B;   **“Nearly a week ago today, in a Shanghai hotel room, or Shanghai hotel ballroom, Adam Silver got up and addressed the players, and LeBron James is one of the players who got up and spoke and said, ‘Hey, what are we doing here? Daryl Morey made these statements,'” McMenamin recalled on air Tuesday. “You know damn well if a player made the same statements and caused such poor ramifications for the league, there would be some sort of league recourse.”**   &amp;#x200B;  He fucking did.  He could have kept quiet, say nothing or give some half-arsed non-answers. But LeBron made sure to say how Morey was 'misinformed' and 'should educate himself' on the matter - as if he's some fucking expert.  You wanna defend that, go ahead."
"The name calling isn't necessary.  So your answer to my question about Morey is just ""I know he studies everything he talks about"", which ok, fine that's your opinion, but usually when someone fires off a tweet and then quickly deletes it after learning of the ramifications, that's because they didn't study the issue well enough, and didn't think over potential repercussions. Morey is smart, but that doesn't mean he can never be wrong, it seems like he messed this one up. If he really studied it and such a strong stance on it then why did he delete the tweet and back off the issue?  Your second question kind of confuses me. Silver asked Lebron and other players who were in China at the time to talk about how they value free expression, Lebron said he didn't feel comfortable talking about the issue or turning loose all of his teammates to talk about something they hadn't studied and learned about. [According to this Dave McMenamin piece that I suggest anyone talking about the situation read, he didn't want his teammates becoming the NBA's PR flacks because they happened to be in China when Morey tweeted about something they were not prepared to handle](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27852687/inside-lebron-james-adam-silver-make-break-moments-china). If Morey was dying to say something so bad why wouldn't he go to China on an NBA trip and bring it up then?"
"But has he, like, considered the financial repercussions of his actions? Like peoples lively hood are at stake. - Lebron James  https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/15/lebron-james-daryl-morey-not-educated-with-hong-kong-protest-tweet.html"
It has nothing to do with that. Lebron James is being a hypocrite.
LeBron James is a coward when it comes to supporting human rights.  I can't take him seriously anymore after what he said earlier this year about Hong Kong.  Fuck him.  What a hypocrite.  I really can't believe he has the nerve to call out another athlete on their public response to injustice after he fucked up so badly.  Make no mistake I agree with what he is saying but the guy really is shameless
Maybe he wasn't [educated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/10/15/lebron-james-criticizes-daryl-moreys-decision-send-controversial-hong-kong-tweet/) on the subject...
Lol cool. Unfortunately that has nothing to do with the current state both teams are at now.  One team is 1st in the West with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The other isn’t even in the playoff picture.. it’s okay to have false hope though.
because he made one wrong comment on a geopolitical issue he has no relation to - it invalidates to a certain extent all his future comments on social issues? especially when it's a social issue that he has had a historic record of speaking out on? man fuck outta here some of y'all just have this desire to find any excuse possible to villify the blm movement or lebron james

"What's amazing as a Suns fan is that when I hear other team's fans talk about the Suns and why they didn't win a championship, I rarely hear them mention the fact that they had an NBA ref working playoff games literally betting against the Suns.

They may have also been biased against the Mavs. He blames it all on Nunez but I'm not buying it.

"I mean....  I don't think this is even close.  One team has a superstar that can be contained, the other has two that can't with one named LeBron James..."
"LeBron: “Everyone said I shouldn’t do it, but I simply had to.”  ESPN: “And with that, LeBron James made the bravest move in sports history, to the cheers of millions of NBA fans around the world. He took his talents to South Beach, but he also took our hearts to a wonderful place they’ve never been before.”"
"&gt; Lebron directly have a middle finger to all the fans that helped build his brand to try and get gift wrapped easy rings. It was decision that negatively affected his brand, and his future to win.  I’m making two points.  1) Cavs fans specifically had nothing to do with building LeBron’s brand. He still would’ve been LeBron James anywhere in the league. He wasn’t somehow “developed” by the Cavs.  2) It absolutely did *not* negatively affect his brand. He firmly became the NBA’s villain - the side effect being he also firmly became **the most talked about NBA player in the world.** Keep in mind that doing all this also set him up for his triumphant return home, and an even bigger payday down the line.  Basically, this all wraps up to the NBA wants your money and doesn’t owe you shit, and the anger at The Decision was based on delusions of “loyalty.”"
So you dont have the link? Im interested in reading about China doing similar stuff to kidnaping the Lakers and murdering Lebron James cause they got salty over a tweet? Crazy that Silver would send the leagues top players there if that was a realistic outcome.

That said, I don’t remember ever feeling particularly bad for Cleveland, just a bunch of people complaining about that vague concept of “loyalty” in sports. LeBron James doesn’t owe anything to the Cleveland Cavaliers, probably the other way around frankly.   Then with all the info that came out afterwards and DG’s infamous letter, I felt even more like it was really all just jealousy based."

"You really sound like you weren't part of basketball during the time. What's your point about Chris Mihm? Saying he's a 'ball-hog' which implies choice, but disparaging the talent around him during the time also?  Dude was in the triangle for half his career and facilitated as a shooting guard, bounced between 4.5 and 6 assists a game his career, and was a ball hog?  Here's the truth no one cares to admit. When Kobe does or has to dominate the ball and facilitate, he does just that. He facilitates, he passes. He will take possessions and take some unnecessarily difficult shots, yes. Those are the examples I'm talking about. When there are other competent players on the roster, he shares the ball by not facilitating as much and letting others pick up possessions. He's not a point guard. Again; are there key moments in the game where he hogs the ball? Yeah, he'll take every end of game or quarter shot regardless of whether it's 5 v 1. He'll take a couple of those throughout the game regardless of the clock. He'll put up a few extra shots if they're far out from the game. He won't stop shooting even if he's having a bad shooting night. But outside of that, holistically, his game doesn't really approximate 'ballhog', and definitely not in the clip shown here during his rookie year.  The box supports this. Those years you're talking about post-Shaq and before Gasol? Aside from 05-06, those were among his highest assist per game years at the time. It tracks nicely with his increase in possessions and usage. The seasons Gasol &amp; other competent team members came in / came to be good? His assist numbers went down. Cause people like D. Fish and Odom can facilitate, Gasol can bang and create in the low post. Again, tracking nicely with his possession and usage -- which went down with other competent players.  Is he Lebron James or Chris Paul? No. That's not his role, never was."

"I think you can express that same idea better.   So, “what are you going to do every week to make sure you’re able to reach that dream?” Or even, “That’s great! But what are you going to do after you make it to the NBA and you’re through playing?” Even if you’re LeBron James, there’s more to life than hooping.   Yeah, most kids ain’t makin pro basketball, but it’s OK for them to have that dream so long as there’s more to it than “I want to be you and famous”."

"To quote Lebron James, ""Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others, and you're only thinking about yourself. I don't want to get in a word sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke. And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually."""
"Harden is undoubtedly a talented person, but Harden fans think he's better than he is. They also think he's Houston's centerpiece and he isn't. He can be the face of the franchise but Houston will not win a championship if they expect James Harden to win it for them. His selfish style wins games in the regular season but there's a reason he doesn't have a ring and it isn't simply CP3 or the Warriors' dynasty.  Firstly, he for some reason thinks he's an elite 3pt shooter and he isn't. He isn't in the top *100* in highest 3pt% in the league. That's the % adjusted for guys who get minutes, not dudes who throw up one 3 and make it, just so we're all on the same page.  He scores a ton bc he doesn't like to pass the ball, so he throws up a ton of shots, conveniently turns his travels into flops that get called as fouls, and ends up spending half the game at the line.   His 2 is more reliable than his 3, but he abandons it too frequently...and he isn't that much more efficient closer to the basket, either. He's just deadly at the line. MJ racked up a ton of points but it would be ludicrous to say MJ was an elite 3pt shooter. Reggie Miller. Ray Allen. Hell, Steve Kerr. Today, those spots belong to the Curry Bros and Kyle Korver. The Jazz have 7 players in the top 100 in 3pt shooting % in the league. 3 of their 4 regular rotation players not in that top 100 are centers, and the rest see  mostly garbage time. That's how the majority of Houston's team is, as well. But you don't get to see that as much when Harden scores 60pts but on 33% shooting. Running up the score bc you take a ton of shots and hog the ball isn't the same as being a sharpshooter.  Harden has guys like P.J. Tucker and Eric Gordon on his team who are way better 3pt shooters than he is. He has made almost 800 3pt attempts this season and the teammate who comes closest to that number has attempted 390. Ben McLemore. Who has been the best 3pt shooter in Houston this season. Harden is #6 on the list, is that high only bc Gordon has been getting less playing time, and yet he still plays selfish.  Harden gets held to LeBron standards bc he acts like he wants to put the franchise on his shoulders.  LeBron not only leads his team, but he also accepts responsibility when his team sucks. Have you ever seen Harden take responsibility on the court when he's playing poorly? Bc I just see him blame his bad shooting on the passes or the refs or non-existent fouls.  So people see hypocrisy in his game, and extend that to his personal life. Whether it's warranted or not.  But for real. He needs to pass the damn ball."
"Mitchell has more Instagram followers than the population of Utah.

"When you're a superstar in a must-win playoff game, you're expected to dominate. The bar has been set so high because all-time greats like Jordan, LeBron, Bird, and Magic stepped up and played their best basketball when their team needed them the most. If you want to be an all-time great, playing up to your standards in a game 6 or 7 isn't good enough. Nobody denies that James Harden is an amazing basketball player, but that's why he's not an all-time great."
"Right, tryna finesse a hot take past the people. Just cause they're both James doesn't put them in the same tier.  LeBron gets called out for things that have absolutely nothing to do with basketball, like what he had for breakfast and the color of sneakers he's wearing. I know I say that jokingly but LeBron has literally been called out for wearing a Dallas Cowboys jersey or a Yankees hat or tweeting generic statements in the past. At least Harden's is still related to basketball."

"Everybody has off games, Steph and Harden had off SERIES and that's a big deal. They also don't have all-time great series against all odds to show for which make their failures that much bigger.  2016 Finals and games 1-5 of the 2018 WCF and 2019 WCSF for Steph were absolute shit shows, but he last two people give him a pass because they eventually won. Harden in 2015 against the Warriors and 2017 against the Spurs was really bad too and it didn't help that his worst games were the elimination games.  Michael Jordan never had a bad playoff series, LeBron James has 3, but he has all-time great against all odds victories. If you want to be compared with all-time greats like these in a favored light, you must perform."
LeBron and James Jones both have 3
"I mean Lou Will would also help your offense tremendously down the stretch of games as he provides a secondary playmaking/bucket getter that can compliment Lebron which the lakers lack and may eventually harm them later on this year as every Lebron James led finals team has always had a secondary distributor like Mo Williams, Dwyane Wade, and Kyrie Irving (apart from 2018 where he went berseck). He would also potentially be running some elite two man game with AD, and with the level of big men defensively that yall have in Mcgee, Dwight, and AD, the defensive issue should be pretty easy to scheme pass. A big part in Lou Will getting worked was the fact that his front line protecting the rim against bron consisted of undersized Trez and Zubac."

"according to what evidence?  If go back to 2007, Lebron just played his first finals and it looked ready to dominate the east. He had no reason to create a superteam because he didn't had to face one.  Then 2007 summer happened and Celtics, that weren't even a playoffs team, turned into the best team not in the est, but in the whole league.  So Lebron now had to deal with 3 stars plus rondo and a deep experienced roster. And look, he almost eliminated them in 2008 playoffs. Cavs were so close, but I would say it was more celtics fauls than Cavs merit.  Wade faced them and got destroyed too, same reason. That's the only reason wade, Lebron and bosh made that decision.  In 2007-08 we had   Boston with Garnett, Allen, Pierce and Rondo  Lakers with Kobe, Gasol and Odom  Suns with Nash, Stoudemire and Marion  Spurs with Duncan, Parker and Ginobili  Cavs with Lebron, Ilgauskas and Hughes  No wonder by James was forced to make a change, also because cleveland wasn't going to attract anybody."
"EVERYBODY (in Memphis) KNOWS THE HASHEEM THABEET PICK WAS THE OWNER MICHAEL HEISLEY'S DOING.   Heisley had not only Jerry West telling him to take Thabeet, but more important, then Grizzlies director of player personnel [Tony Barone Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Barone) telling him to take Hasheem Thabeet. The reasoning was the old adage, ""you can't teach size."" Thabeet's size and athleticism would change the game defensively.  But Marc Gasol had just had a good rookie season and looked like a keeper as a rookie. Memphis had seen Thabeet when UConn played the Memphis Tigers the season before and he was physically dominated by [Memphis' 6'7 center Joey Dorsey.](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/boxscore?gameId=273200041). Grizz fans were calling Thabeet ""Thabust"" before the draft. There was not a universal sentiment on who the Grizz should take except universal agreement they should not take Hasheem Thabeet. Sports talk call-in shows, the Grizzlies's website message board, it was agreed; do not take Thabeet. Heisley was a Georgetown grad and a big fan of Big East basketball.  I believe Chris Wallace wanted to draft Tyreke Evans or James Harden. Head Coach Lionel Hollins was quoted on liking Steph Curry. Local sports columnist Geoff Calkins wrote a powerful column about why the Grizzlies had to draft Rickey Rubio. Many of the Tiger fans wanted the Grizz to draft star Memphis Tigers freshman Tyreke Evans.   The only two potential draftees that reportedly didn't want to play in Memphis at the time were Steph Curry and Rickey Rubio. There was no public speculation Harden didn't want the Grizz to draft him. Harden came to Memphis for a pre-draft workout. Ironically, Hasheem Thabeet cancelled a Memphis visit right before the draft. There was speculation that it was because Thabeet didn't want the Grizz to draft him. Locally the common opinion AT THE TIME was Thabeet's agent didn't want the Grizzlies to see how aloof he was so they would decide not to draft him.  But Heisley wanted Thabeet. There were 4 big decisions that were on Michael Heisley that all ended up failing that he forced on General Manager (and notorious ""Yes Man"") Chris Wallace during a 18 month period. 1) During the 2008 draft, Heisley negotiated a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves that sent the draft rights to Kevin Love and Mike Miller to Minny for the rights to OJ Mayo (plus a trade of crap contracts of Brian Cardinal and Marko Jaric). 2) He forced the Grizzlies to draft Hasheem Thabeet in the 2009 draft. 3) Heisley refused to budge on a contract extension for Rudy Gay; Heisley offered $50 million, Gay wanted $60 million. Andrea Bargnani signed a $50 million extension and Gay had been a better pro, but Heisley wouldn't move off the $50 million offer. Gay played out this season, and became a free agent at the same as Lebron James and basically was going to sign a huge deal with the Nets so the Grizzlies ended up giving him a max $84 million deal, which is the reason the Grizzlies traded Gay in 2013 and suffered at small forward for seasons after Gay was traded. 4) And Heisley forced the Grizzlies to sign Allen Iverson before the 2009 season. Iverson refused to accept the role he was signed to do, be an offensive spark off the bench, because he felt he was better than point guard Mike Conley. It led to discord on the team.  Drafting Hasheem Thabeet might have motivated Marc Gasol to get into great shape during the summer of 2009. He lost the girth he had in 2008-09 and looked amazing. And he played with more energy in his good physique next to Zach Randolph.  If the Grizzlies had drafted James Harden, conceivably OJ Mayo would have been the odd man out when everyone realized that the 2009 first team all rookie player was inferior to Harden at shooting guard and could not outplay Mike Conley as a point guard. If Mayo is not traded, it's unlikely the Grizzlies sign Tony Allen in 2010 with Harden and Mayo on the roster (plus a likely top 14 draft pick). But a starting five of Conley, Harden, Gay, Randolph, and Gasol is probably championship quality by 2011, 2012.   What could have been..."
"&gt; He lost the game??? Im talking about in the playoffs, losing games in the playoffs means it didn’t go well.  Bruh he lost the game because LeBron fucking James dropped 40 points, not because he didn’t play well..."
LeBron James has actually been black this whole time
Lebron james albeit a diva and never gonna be better than MJ. Is for sure the GOAT off the court. Sucha wholesome guy who cares for the greater good.
It was LeBron James complaining and the minimum player was DeMarcus Cousins
"Russell Westbrook is shooting a higher field goal percentage from mid-range this season than Paul George, Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, LeBron James, Joel Embiid, Pascal Siakam, Jayson Tatum, Lou Williams, etc.  Russ - 40.3% on 5.1 FGAs  PG - 36.6% on 3.6 FGAs  AD - 36.5% on 4.2 FGAs  Jimmy - 30.7% on 3.0 FGAs  Lebron - 34.8% on 3.2 FGAs  Tatum - 37.9% on 3.2 FGAs  Embiid - 40.1% on 4.9 FGAs  Siakam - 31.5% on 2.9 FGAs  Lou - 38.4% on 3.8 FGAs  https://stats.nba.com/players/shooting/?DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=1&amp;sort=Mid-Range%20FG%20PCT"
"well it's just freakish in nature, you've really never seen anything like - or I haven't seen anything like - the both sides of the backboard block of Lebron James.  The way he all of a sudden just accelerates and speeds up with it as well.  It's arguably the greatest defensive play ever in terms of clutch moments and the magnitude of the moment, against the greatest regular season winning of all time, on the road, coming from down 3-1, returned to the team he left, city never won a championship, can't really think of anything like it.   Also much as JR's mistake gets talked about, he made this play by James possible by forcing Andre to adjust.  Kyrie's shot is one of the gutsiest if not the gutsiest Finals shot ever. I guess while we are at it, Ray Allen's is the the most nerve wracking I've seen.  Of course a lot can be subjective in all the above."
LeBron James with the rejection
"Bear in mind though that his shooting efficiency is already quite good for a high volume shooter, even though on the surface his 32% from 3 looks bad. He's at **58.4% TS** on 21 FGA and 9 FTA, which is comparable to other high volume stars like LeBron James (58.2% TS on 20FGA/6FTA), Kawhi Leonard (58.6% TS on 20FGA/7FTA), and Jimmy Butler (58.3% TS on 13FGA/9FTA)."
"That's true, but just like the 80's, the dynamic hasn't changed much.  4 teams are great, the rest are pretty much cannon fodder till the playoffs.  The playoffs start, the 7-8 seeds are gone without much of a fight and the NBA is fine with it. The only difference is that the past 8-9 years have seen more three pointers and less play in the post, but that could be because of what is seemed as a foul nowadays.  This could be a way to boost scoring, but it also grinds the game to studdering mess in the 4th.  At least in the 80's they used to be able to bang in the paint, where now fouls are drawn at the slightest touch.  So much they can even decide play styles see: James Harden see: Anyone who breathes on LeBron in the playoffs  or they can even decide series just for ratings see: Kings v. Lakers game 6 in 2002.  Where because the NBA didn't want to see a series between Sacramento and New Jersey because it would be bad for the ratings of the finals.  I'll leave it there, well said to ya.  I think both of our sides have relevance.  Point being, the NBA is too predictable for it to be entertaining for me.  I think the NBA'S coverage on ESPN is ungodly.  They literally have turned into the NBA network and cover it year round, which has given the sport enormous coverage as most people get 80% of their sports news from this network.  I think the NBA has marketed itself extremely well for what is essentially a forgone conclusion every season.  Yes, there is occasionally all be it very rarely a team line the Raptors or Golden State, but they were MINUS 275 to win the championship with Durant.  You had to out $275 to win back just $100 on that bet hahaha what other team sport has that for a championship at the beginning of the season!?"
"4 years ago, you could see the sun very clearly at 6 AM during June, but I didn't care. As a sucker for redemption arcs (btw, go play RDR2), I was not even in my bed anymore.   I was on the floor, close to the TV as I could've been (and it was a decent size 32 but still), and I AM OLDER than LeBron (not by much, but still). I am not from Cleveland, I am not from USA, and the worst part - I wasn't even a big fan of his until he returned from Miami. But that (and previous) season, we clicked.   So, BLOCKED BY JAMES, then KYRIE FOR 3, and GREAT DEFENSE BY LOVE and now everybody in the house is awake in a split of a second because of me, because of ""CLEVELAND! THIS IS FOR YOU!"". It was 3 to 1, and they did it.   I can't even remember when was the last time I was so happy regarding sports in general. It was bigger than sport, it was a comeback story never seen before in the NBA finals, live in front of my eyes, unfolding just the way it was suppose to (in my head at least).  It was a great night not to be sleeping. I can't even imagine how it felt like for the people of Ohio, but for me - it was one of the best sports moments in history."
I'd give it to someone else both years. In 05-06 I would give it to LeBron James - 31-7-6 with elite defense. If your argument for 04-05 nash was best player best team then in 05-06 it should be someone from the pistons(64 wins) or spurs(63 wins).
eh not even the media calls him King James thats just his twitter username at this point.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic\_Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson)  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron\_James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James)

Yeah....Ppl voted him as US president. Maybe y’all bar is too high when U judge LeBron James
"*""juneteenth should be celebrated just like chinese new year's day""-LeBron James*"
"For those that don’t know, this is the [court](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/basketball-player-lebron-james-at-a-practice-session-at-steven-in-picture-id73866408?s=612x612)  The guy was the founder of LA Gear.

Here’s an article from 2011 of the Heat practicing there.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/fl-xpm-2011-01-12-sfl-miami-heat-big-house-s011211-story,amp.html"
Nah man. People were saying the Lakers were favorites for the nr. 1 pick. After all they only had LeBron James and Anthony Davis as All-star players. Experts knew it was hard to win with them leading the way. ^^^^^^^^^^/s
LeBron James averaging 26 pts and 10 asts in his 17th season
"If Antonio McDyess doesn't get ejected early in Game 5 of the 2007 ECF vs. Cleveland, I don't see that LeBron James' 29-of-last-30 run happening exactly the same way. All Detroit would have need was *one* instance of properly helping in the paint or one deflected pass or shot attempt and they may have been able to win.   Always saw that ejection as a butterfly effect moment. Without it, we could have been looking at another Pistons-Spurs finals in 2007."
"Virtually every detail from the 2016 Finals. Ten years ago, LeBron was technically still in his first stint with the Cavaliers, so imagine trying to tell someone that:  1. LeBron left the Cavs to form a LBJ-Wade-Bosh super team in Miami, basically building their own custom roster from the ground up.  2. Small school sensation Stephen Curry turns out to be the greatest shooter in NBA history.  3. The Warriors break the single season record for wins, topping the '96 Bulls.  4. LeBron *comes back* to Cleveland and leads them to the Finals in 2015, averaging 36, 13, and 9.   5. Imagine telling someone back then that Cleveland and Golden State would meet in four straight finals *after* LeBron James chose to leave in 2010.   6. The Warriors win three rings.  7. The one ring the Warriors lost came during their record-breaking season, where LeBron leads an inexplicable 3-1 comeback and seals a Game 7 ring for the Cavs with a series-saving last minute chasedown block (while averaging 30, 11, and 9).   8. J.R. Smith celebrates shirtless for days on end.   9. Some guy on the streets of Cleveland eats poop.   10. The Warriors respond by signing Kevin Durant.   Nothing about this timeline isn't insane, just as it pertains to the Warriors and Cavs alone. I don't think I would have believed a single second of it back then."
"All of that is pretty much true for America as well. The majority of people can name LeBron James, it falls off quick from there. The youth likely have more names on their tongue, but fandom is what truly sparks the familiarity. And then American football is still the crowd king of the nation."
"I'm gonna sound like a hater I'm sure but what do you expect when an entire team is used to watching one guy do everything, and then that guy leaves the court? Almost every possession that Finals ended with LeBron making the decision, and then in the 24 minutes he's off the court in 6 games they're supposed to figure out how to score? It's the same thing with Russ during his MVP season and how bad the on/off stats were. When you're used to standing in a spot waiting for Russ to pass you the ball, and now he's off the court, nobody knows what to do or how to play then. James was incredible that series for sure, but a small sample size terrible on/off should be expected given the circumstances."
"An adulthood or so ago some friends of mine and I resolved to watch every single Washington Wizards game during a brief period in which they were actually quite good.  Their centers and one forward were primarily defensive players, and the offense revolved around Gilbert Arenas, Antwan Jamieson, and Larry Hughes or Caron Butler, depending on the year.    &amp;#x200B;  Virtually no game was ever out of reach because whenever the other side started pulling ahead, Arenas and crew would just pass a couple of times to position the referees, and then Arenas would go for a layup, jerk his arm as part of the layup movement whether or not he was actually fouled, and maybe over half the time he'd ice a three point play with the foul shot.  At the same time they were also stalling the momentum of the other team, and stacking up the fouls until the other side had to begin heavy rotations, which allowed for the  Holy Trinity to exploit player mismatches.  I mean, they did that like thirty or forty times in the year, and often wound up winning.  &amp;#x200B;  Now, the crazy part about it is that Arenas could drop threes from almost half court at will--and actually got in such a battle with Lebron James in a playoff game.  But the outside game didn't draw the fouls that the Wizards strategically used to decide who they were going to play against in the last two minutes and OT."
 &gt;and clamped up Lebron James  28/8/4 on 68% true shooting is clamped to you?
"Blame Michael Jordan.  Before he took over, big men ruled basketball.  Once he came along, everyone wanted to be like Mike, even the bigger kids.  That is why bigger guys like Lebron James and Kevin Durant developed handles instead of low post moves.    Kerr is probably in the minority on disliking this trend.  Talented big men hard to find, simply because they are rarer in general.  I'm sure a lot of execs are happy they don't need to find a talented 7 footer to compete anymore."
"He def traveled, but the refs are blind as usual. Because of the refs, I don’t miss the NBA at all. The commissioner has never address The miss calls on Lebron. 17 years of bias refs but don’t blow on James Harden, cause it’s an automatic foul."
You still have to give props to Lebron James for his good defensive efforts though that only makes Kobe's fade away only more impressive.
"I disagree with regards to Kawhi's post season run last year. I think that because it became more apparent that he was playing  hobbled as the playoffs went on it makes people overlook the fact that he displayed plenty of individual dominance throughout those playoffs.   * Averaging 31/9/4 en route to a championship  * Holds the record for the most points in a single playoff run in franchise history  * Is third in franchise history for total playoff points despite being a Toronto Raptor for *only one postseason*.  * Averaging the third most points in a playoff run in *NBA history*. The first and second place records are held by Michael Jordan and LeBron James respectively.  * Hitting the dagger over Embiid in Game 4 to prevent them from going down 3-1.  * Going on an 8-0 run during the second overtime of game 3 vs the Bucks to prevent them from going down 3-0 (which nobody has ever come back from).  * Scored 15  points in the fourth quarter of game 7 along with the only Game 7 buzzerbeater in the history of the league.  * Scoring 12 points in the fourth quarter of game 5 against the Bucks to put them up in the series.  * Was the primary defender of the reigning MVP from games 3-6 onwards, leading his team back from an 0-2 deficit.  * Won Finals MVP averaging 29/10/4 despite playing while hobbled."
"Off the top of my head: Westbrook, KD, Giannis, Curry, Kyrie, LeBron, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Derrick Rose, James Harden, Chris Paul, Kawhi. I'm missing 2? I don't think PG, Mitchell, or Lillard have either a chip or MVP.  Edit: Chris Paul doesn't have either as well."
"Fine, I'll replace Kevin Love with LeBron James."
"I kinda get why the perception is there. It’s cause the time he didn’t play well it was in the finals, he had just taken the “best player crown”, and beating his team is the defining career moment for Lebron James. Literally everyone who watches basketball at all watched the 2016 finals.   Almost the entire rest of his playoff career is rather exceptional lol."
"I wouldn't really say it was a serviceable bench. It was kinda just LeBron +delly+Thompson. Shump I think was coming off a hand injury and was getting painkiller injections in between games just so he could play. Jr wasn't his best. Mozgov played hard but he was just too slow for the warriors. Then they also had to play James ""LeBron's friend"" Jones, who was utterly humiliated when he was left hanging for a high five by igoudala.   I fully believe that if Kelly olynyk didn't try to dissemble kevin love that the Cavs would've won the finals, and LeBron refuses taking the fmvp and instead gives it to Delly for his efforts in putty curry in a cardboard box of mediocrity and mailing him to South America."
Lebron James has entered the chat
"I mean, I won't kill someone for having a diff. opinion, but as a neutral fan it's pretty obvious that LeBron is the driver of that team. He handles the ball more, facilitates more, and can easily score more if the situation depends on it. AD is a bonafide elite player, but LeBron James is a virtuoso of the game and controls the floor whenever he's in the game."
Don’t forget all the ones they made to get to game 7 against one of the best teams of all-time. Lebron couldn’t even win 1 game against them. Funny how these Lakers fans come out of the woodwork nowadays. They needed Lebron James to become relevant again and still couldn’t make the playoffs. Don’t forget Westbrook dragging the Thunder to the 5th seed the year before.
I don't see how anyone could ever see him being better then Lebron James honestly
"Looks like it was to give \[LeBron some additional exposure to college scouts\]([https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/06/01/lebron-james-basketball-rise-came-through-bay-area/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/06/01/lebron-james-basketball-rise-came-through-bay-area/)). It's crazy because pretty much their entire starting 5 that summer played in the NBA at some point between LeBron, Kendrick Perkins, Leon Powe &amp; Demarcus Nelson"
Lol did you forget about Lebron James
"Lots of players before the modern era, but recently D.Wade comes to mind.  Edit: Oops read this as win a championship.

"Imo AD is a top ~7 player, and top 5 this season with Curry and Durant being out.   Wade was still a top 5 player in 2011, LeBron was still an MVP Candidate  &gt;Their respective supporting casts are on equal footing  Debatable, cause to be honest the Bucks are an OK team outside of Giannis but they're a great fit. Also Middleton is great but not even close to as good a 2nd option as Davis.   LeBron has/ has had great teammates, but he's still an MVP Candidate because he's LeBron Fucking James. Media voters won't give that consistency they gave Durant and Curry, partly because it's bias, partly because LeBron is so much greater than the rest"
"He really did though. Silver had to defend Morey vs Bron in a meeting between Silver, the Nets, and the Lakers.  &gt;Silver opened the floor. James raised his hand.   &gt;   &gt;His question was related to Morey -- and the commissioner's handling of the Rockets' GM. James, to paraphrase, told Silver that he knew that if a player caused the same type of uproar with something he said or tweeted, the player wouldn't be able to skate on it. There would be some type of repercussion. So, James wanted to know, what was Silver going to do about it in Morey's case?   &gt;   &gt;Silver pushed back, reminding the players that the league never doled out discipline when they publicly criticized President Donald Trump. Morey was exercising the same liberty when he challenged China. Regardless of the financial fallout of one versus the other, that's not what should matter. Silver might have disliked the ramifications of Morey's tweet, but he would defend the right to say it.

"Jesus this is just wrong as hell. First off, Brady going to Tampa made them the 4th highest favoured team to win the title, they were previously a middle of the pack team.   Second, Lebron leaving the east didn’t open the door for shit, the 2019 raptors absolutely roll through pretty much every iteration of James’ cavs and the 2016 version is the only team that could win. They most definitely demolish whatever ragtag shit squad Lebron would’ve had in 2019 and that’s 100%. Lebron didn’t change any odds for titles until a year later when LA surrounded him with experienced vets and another superstar player, he barely managed a winning record in his first year and couldn’t even make the playoffs."
"Lebron James.  As a kid i never really followed the NBA, but around 2002/2003 i started getting more into American sports/leagues and the up and coming kid from Akron was all over the news, so i got interested and started folowing his path. Over time my ""love"" for him switched to the team itself and it remained until today. That extended to Cleveland in general as i now follow the Browns and Indians too."
He wouldn't overtly say that you are right but the superiority and authority in Bill's writing here certainly doesn't close the door on the criticism that he actually thought he and his fellow writers could mentor Lebron James in absence of Lebron having a father figure.
"dude, the end of the game lou will stuff is crazy to me. The opposing teams just hunt him every fucking play. That Laker game where Lebron was hunting Lou I couldn't believe Doc left him in for so long. I don't care what your help D is, if Lou Will is the primary defender on Lebron fucking James it's game over lol"
I mean that's debatable. Just because you have 2 phenomenal playmakers doesn't mean it will always be a bad fit.  Imagine showtime with Lebron James running up the court.
"There will be a spot on at least 1 bench for the son of lebron james, guaranteed. Even if he sucks his rookie year, it'll be worth the bench spot for a shit team to take a chance on him."
Didn't you know? LeBron was birthed as a 6'8 220 pound man.  He went straight from the womb to the hardwood.  Gloria James didn't have to do anything after giving birth.
"The Lakers were [long gone from China back in the States when LeBron said what he did about Morey's stance](https://time.com/5700667/lebron-james-nba-china/), 10 days later. So that point's moot.     Harden's comments weren't talked about as much because he said his comments 3 days after Morey's while the team was still in Tokyo. You really think Harden meant it when he said ""We apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there,""?     Read between the lines. Obviously he's not going to say anything to piss off China more with how much his and his team's income is influenced by them while they're not on home soil. He's also the star player of Morey's team, so he had to say something one way or another, and he did it without shitting on Morey.      The difference between LeBron and Harden is LeBron is bigger than the NBA.      He had a real chance to influence other North American athletes, politicians and celebrities to speak out against China, regardless of the residual indirect financial benefits they get from that country, and he blew it. Literally keeping his mouth shut would have said more than what he actually said is the point.  Nike was able to campaign about human injustices without shitting on those speaking out against China.  Your closet probably has Nike products, and if not your Walmart clothes were probably made in China with that sweatshop labour you speak of as well, so FOH with your highhorse trying to call others hypocrites."
"Calling him out for it and making it sound like he is a pro CCP shill are two wildly different things. The nature of his comments deserve way more nuanced criticism than just running with some ridiculously over-exaggerated ""LeMao James"" type bullshit.  The problem with the latter is that there are always a fuckton of people coming into these threads making these claims to discredit or distract from whatever else LeBron is talking about like it means jack shit in a specifically different discussion. It's such an obvious tactic too."
"LeBron ""Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself"" James"
"&gt;I don't get this argument. LeBron James, sure. If you aren't a basketball fan, you don't know any of the other players. You think some rando living in Idaho knows who Giannis or KD are? Absolutely not.   Assuming that kid doesn't live under a rock, he's more likely to know top NBA players than any other sport in North America. Marketing of player leads to higher growth of the sport. Why? Kids will more readily identify with a player than a specific team. Kid likes player. Kid becomes fan.  Look at how many more followers the most popular NBA players have relative to the other league's most popular players. Look at how much social media interaction a Woj bomb/Chams tweet generates relative to a Schefter/Rapaport big news tweet. Even on here reddit we have 1M+ more subscribers than r/nfl. Marketing players leads to greater popularity in the sport which leads to the sport growing more. That's my point.  Even though the NBA is ""struggling"" on its TV deal, it's still gaining more fans and more popular than ever."
"I don't get this argument. LeBron James, sure. If you aren't a basketball fan, you don't know any of the other players. You think some rando living in Idaho knows who Giannis or KD are? Absolutely not.   If it's so great then why are the tv deals struggling? If anything, the pivot to social media has hampered the NBA, not helped it. Most of my friends watch the 10 min YouTube highlights because they don't have time to watch 82 games. They also don't enjoy all of the fouls.   With the NFL it's an event for a game. NBA, not so much."
"It was the best because of what at stake first for the warriors if they won the series they will be the best team in history, while for the cavs and lebron james it was the long championship drought in major professional sports league for the city of cleveland it may not be the best when it terms of the actual game play but for sure we all agree that when it comes to storyline it was second to none"
"&gt; Bill didn't chase stats, as opposed to Michael Jeffrey ""give-me-the-damn-ball"" Jordan.  Funny you can say that for a player you never watched. Jordan actually made an effort in his career to score less and pass mored because his coach thought that was the best way possible for his team to win.  &gt; But when stats mattered, the few times they did, he had them.  Jordan also had it, and in a far larger number. MJ averaged 33.6/6.0/6.0 in the NBA Finals, if that's not putting up stats when it matters most i don't know what it is.  &gt; 6 for 6 in the finals is impressive? How do you feel about 21 for 21? Russell had that in meaningful winner take all games.   My argument specifically mentioned individual accomplishments and individual stats. You can't gauge how good a player is by how many championships he won, that's sillyness. If that's the case then Sam Jones is greater than LeBron James since 10 &gt; 3  Russell played multiple years of his career with HoFers like Sam Jones, Tommy Heinsohn, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, Bailey Howell and many others not mentioned. He always had the best team, Wilt always outplayed him, but he still won.  &gt; I get that you REALLY like stats. But too many players- like Kareem, who played against MJ and just missed playing Russell- call Russell the GOAT despite stats.  Well, Wilt thought himself was the GOAT and he played against Russell his entire career and saw Jordan play, so what's your point? Magic Johnson and Larry Bird thought MJ was the GOAT when they were still in the league, so saying Kareem thought Russell was the GOAT doesn't prove shit.  If you wanna make an argument that Russell is the greatest winner, go for it, but don't try to make one that he is the GOAT, because it just falls flat in it's face. The only argument is that he won alot, because you can't make an argument outside of winning that he was better than Wilt, let alone Michael.  If winning was all it took to make a player greater than the other then Draymond Green would be greater than Charles Barkley."
"*""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. Except when it comes your bottom line.""* -LeBron James"
Not only was he usually playing the strongest dynasty in sports history but he made most of the series competitive at least.   He put up crazy numbers and going game by game he has a better record in the Finals than LeBron James who has won 2 more Finals series and lost 2 less. Even though he was facing teams far far better than his he didn't usually get freight trained like LeBron has so many times
"An interesting parallel that can be drawn is to LeBron, with a Finals record of 3-6.   Jerry West has spoken publicly several times in defence of LeBron. Here are some quotes from an [ESPN article](https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/16020136/nba-playoffs-2016-jerry-west-defends-lebron-greatness) during the 2016 Finals when GSW had gone up 3-1:  &gt;""With him, the negativity that surrounds him, honestly, to me, I think is so unjust and so unfair. Take him off of the team and see how these teams do. That's all you have to do. Take him off. And it frustrates the heck out of me when I see some of these players who play this game at an enormously high level get criticized because their teams quote, 'Can't win the big one.' The damn guy gets his teams there every year. He wins. For people to criticize him, I think that's why he really resonates.""   &gt;   &gt;""You do your best, you try your best, you play your best and you're still not good enough to get your team to where you want to go, and that's \[to be the\] last man standing,"" West said. ""And it's not one guy. It's a group of people.""   &gt;   &gt;In the summer of 2011, after James and the [Miami Heat](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat) lost to the [Dallas Mavericks](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks) to drop his personal Finals record to 0-2, he [sought counsel from both West and Isiah Thomas](https://www.espn.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/11038247/nba-playoffs-lebron-james-advice-jerry-west-isiah-thomas) to find out how they dealt with the pain of losing.   &gt;   &gt;""I talked to him,"" West remembered. ""I did talk to him personally about that. And I said: 'Jesus Christ, you think you're frustrated? How would you like to get there eight times and not win?' I told him, 'I wanted to quit.' In the height of my career, I wanted to quit. I was so angry, so frustrated.""   &gt;   &gt;""When he gets on the court, this guy plays. I mean, he plays,"" West said. ""He's committed. All great, great players -- and obviously he's one of the most unique players we've ever had because of his size and his skill set. He's one of the smartest players, if not the smartest player, I've ever seen in my life.   &gt;   &gt;""His ability to find people on the court, his ability to make huge plays in games -- and they may not be offensive plays. It's like chasing down guys, blocking shots. How many people, if you watch him, a lot of people just focus on guys scoring. You have to watch them move on the court. You have to watch their anticipation. And if you watch him, you say to yourself: 'My God. He's like three steps ahead of everyone mentally.'""   &gt;   &gt;""This is one of the truly great players we've ever seen in our lifetime,"" West continued. ""In our *lifetime*."
LeBron James.
"&gt;That being said, I don’t think it should come up every time LeBron and BLM do.  It's one thing to think it shouldn't come up. It's another to think that everyone that brings it up is being fake and doesn't really care about HK.  See the difference?  &gt; His comments on HK shouldn’t undermine every other opinion he has.   I guess I look at it like this: Why do people give a fuck about what LeBron has to say on *any* social issue? I mean, does him being good at basketball automatically mean that he has meaningful or intelligent takes on non-basketball issues?  Of course not, so why *should* people care about LeBron? When I ask this, people typically try to make a case for LeBron as a knowledgeable, insightful, and outspoken individual on issues regarding social justice. That's fine, but if that's the reason that we should care about what he is saying, then it is reasonable to examine his actions in this area. His actions regarding HK would fall under this.  See what I'm getting at? It doesn't invalidate his opinion. It does call into question why anyone should give a fuck about it though.  &gt; I just find it disingenuous when any time LeBron says something about BLM, the top comment is always something about HK and how LeBron is an evil money grabbing shill who’s opinions are worth shit and only cares about his wallet.    What's disingenuous about it? The fact that you don't care about it that much or that you don't see it as a problem doesn't mean that other people aren't allowed to feel different. It doesn't mean that they are disingenuous for expressing *their* feelings on the issue.  &gt; He just cares more about issues regarding black people in America because he is a black person in America.   That's fine, but it isn't like he just kept his mouth shut about the whole Morey/HK issue. If you believe reporting from Dave McMenamin, LeBron was essentially lobbying for Morey to be punished for what he tweeted out. From the relevant article:  &gt;His \[James\] question was related to Morey -- and the commissioner's handling of the Rockets' GM. James, to paraphrase, told Silver that he knew that if a player caused the same type of uproar with something he said or tweeted, the player wouldn't be able to skate on it. There would be some type of repercussion. So, James wanted to know, what was Silver going to do about it in Morey's case?  Not caring is one thing. Wanting to see Morey punished for speaking out on a social justice issue because it ruffled some feathers is totally fucking different, right?  What does LeBron being black and caring more about issues impacting black people have to do with him wanting to see Morey punished for speaking on on HK?  &gt; Should he care about HK even though it doesn’t directly affect him? Absolutely. But that argument should be kept entirely separate from his domestic social activism.   Why? Morey stood up and tweeted out on an issue of social justice. LeBron got upset that it ruffled feathers and impacted his ability to do business so he, apparently, advocated for Morey to be punished.  If LeBron is dragging the NFL for how they treated Kaep for speaking/acting out on a social justice issue because it ruffled feathers and impacted the NFL's bottom line, why wouldn't his attitude towards Morey be relevant?   More to the point, even if *you* want to keep them separate, why is thinking that they are related so fucking bad that you feel the need to personally attack people that disagree with you?"
"1. LeBron James: 239 Games Played- 6,911 Points  2. Michael Jordan: 179 Games Played- 5,987 Points   3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: 237 Games Played- 5,762 Points   4. Kobe Bryant: 220 Games Played- 5,640 Points   5. Shaquille O’Neal: 216 Games Played- 5,250 Points"
"I'm going to preface this by saying the Suns management has been very bad since Sarver took over.  I think there is a possibility that James Jones isn't trash, though and the other members of his staff seem competent as well.  However, I have to add this.  Not so hot take : The Laker's management is currently worse than the Suns they just happen to be one of the largest markets and Lebron wanted to play in LA.  If Lebron doesn't come to LA the Lakers float around in mediocrity without a top-10 pick for the next 3-5 years."
&gt;do you actually want to engage and change opinions?  You need to be able to identify when opinions aren't going to change and for that user this is one such time. So no I don't want to engage and change opinions. No in this sub when the subject is LeBron James. I am not interested. Get a mod to delete my comment or ban me if you think I'm not allowed to comment what I comment instead of sticking my head in the pile of shit that is any post about LeBron James in r/nba.
"yes it is what Lebron went after him for.  In his own words:    &gt; ""I don't want to get into a ... feud with Daryl but I believe he wasn't educated about the situation at hand and he spoke,"" James told reporters on Monday ahead of the Lakers' preseason game against the Warriors. ""So many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually. &gt;   This is the quote everybody stops at.  Here's the rest:    &gt; ""Just be careful what we tweet ... even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech,"" he added. ""But there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.""  James clarified in a tweet afterward that he does ""not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I’m not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that.""  &gt; ""I think when we talk about the political side, I think it's a very delicate situation.  Very sensitive situation. For me personally, if any of you guys know me or always cover me, you guys know when I speak about something, I speak about something I'm very knowledgeable about. Something that hits home for me. Something I'm very passionate about. I feel like with this particular situation, not only was I not informed enough about--I just felt like it was something not only myself or my teammates or our organization had enough information to even talk about it at that point in time. And we still feel the same way.""  People just trying to tear him down for bullshit like always.  I remember when people tried to shit on him even as he donated 3 million to the boys and girls club through The Decision.  Motherfuckers will find any excuse."
"And everyone else too lol.  Besides LeBron, they lost significant playing time from their next 7 minute getters in the previous year.  |Player|2010 Minutes|2011 Minutes|Change| :--|--:|--:|--:| |LeBron James|2966|0|-2966| |Mo Williams|2359|1065|-1294| |Anthony Parker|2289|2091|-198| |Anderson Varejão|2166|994|-1172| |J.J.

"&gt; Because it literally comes up every time LeBron has anything to do with activism, and that’s the only time it ever appears on this sub.   So your evidence that they don't really care is that the only time the topic comes up in a *basketball* sub is in relation to a highly public *basketball* player?  Fuck, I guess you showed me...  &gt; The Kaep situation has literally nothing to do with Hong Kong but before I even opened the comments I knew exactly what the top comment would say.  So are you just going to play dumb and ignore all relevant context? I mean, if this article/thread was just about some random fucking dude talking about Kaep, it would get reported and removed for not being relevant to the sub. The thing that makes it relevant is because it's Lebron James giving his opinion. Specifically, that opinion related to an issue related to issues of social justice and how LeBron thinks those in power should treat someone that had the courage to speak against oppression.  So, yeah, if you ignore all context and artificially pretend that this thread is 100% about Kaepernick, then HK discussions have no place here. However, if you exercise a little intellectual integrity and view this as an article about Lebron James speaking on issues of social justice, it isn't crazy that people might want to talk about how he has approached other social justice issues.  Now, you can say that he shouldn't get as much hate as he does for the HK things, and that's fine if you feel that way. However, ignoring all relevant context about why the article is here in the first place is dumb. Additionally, assuming anyone that wants to bring it up must not really care about HK is equally dumb."
Going from LeBron James
"man, he backtracked like a motherfucker.  if you wanna do Morey, here are lebron's comments:  LeBron James believes Rockets general manager Daryl Morey was ""misinformed and not educated on the situation"" when he tweeted in support of anti-government protestors in Hong Kong.  ""I don't want to get into a ... feud with Daryl but I believe he wasn't educated about the situation at hand and he spoke,"" James told reporters on Monday ahead of the Lakers' preseason game against the Warriors. ""So many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually.  ""Just be careful what we tweet ... even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech,"" he added. ""But there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.""  James clarified in a tweet afterward that he does ""not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I’m not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that.""  James reportedly didn't want players to have to publicly discuss something they weren't comfortable speaking about, and players also felt reservations considering the U.S. and China are involved in a trade dispute, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania.  ""I think when we talk about the political side, I think it's a very delicate situation,"" James said Monday. ""Very sensitive situation. For me personally, if any of you guys know me or always cover me, you guys know when I speak about something, I speak about something I'm very knowledgeable about. Something that hits home for me. Something I'm very passionate about. I feel like with this particular situation, not only was I not informed enough about--I just felt like it was something not only myself or my teammates or our organization had enough information to even talk about it at that point in time. And we still feel the same way.""  The entire time he's talking about Morey specifically for putting them all in a bad spot because they were actually in China, but every asshole keeps trying to turn it into ""Lebron must hate freedom!"" bullshit."
If you where lebron James you would protect your fortune over anything as well .  Speaking up on support of Kap  has zero negative impact against his money or brand
"At first glance probably, but there is a second guote :  [ ""I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.""](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/what-did-lebron-james-say-about-china-nearly-everyone-else-ncna1069131)"
"I don't want to get into a ... feud with LeBron James, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke.  People might be harmed not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually."
"Well, I benefitted a great deal from not having any college debt, and a lot of other people didn't.  And, my family has nowhere near the wealth of people like your average NBA player, let alone Lebron James or Bill Gates.  Soooo... I'm gonna go ahead and say it's ""a real thing."""
Lebron 3-6 James
Oh gosh Sir lord Jesus Christ lebron James said it. Wow!
"Because James Harden when out and sucked the Chinese governments dick. Why the fuck was Morey tweeting when players were on ground in an evil dictatorship. He compromised them and forced every player there to choose between their dignity and their lives, and they just barely got out.     If you believe that quote why are you criticizing LeBron ?"
But if you follow the exact same logic Lebron should publicly apologize to Morey for the aggressive comment he made. If Morey was not a top 5 GM he would have been blacklisted like CK in part because of james' comment
Lebron James sports agency
"How about mine   Team Chicago Bulls   Pg - Marcus Smart Sg- Klay Thompson Sf- Lebron James Pf- Taurean Prince C-Bam Adebayo   Bench  Avery Bradley, Kendrick Nunn, Matthew Dellavedova, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Og Anunoby, Markieff Morris, Javale McGee and Mike Muscala"
"Rich Paul represents 31 basketball players. 25 are not in the LA market, several of which are in fantastic spots that they’re clearly not trying to leave. A few aren’t in the league, and one is in an international league.  Acting like all Klutch Sports is is source for finding and recruiting teammates for Lebron James is disrespectful to Rich Paul and the work he put in to build arguably the best NBA agency group, and it’s just flat out incorrect."
"The Lakers have had multiple top ten players of all time *decide* to join their team almost every single decade. Wilt joins a team that already has Elgin Baylor and Jerry West. Championship. Kareem joins in 75 for the next decade and a half. Championships. Magic in 1979 would be the first of two top ten players ever drafted by the Lakers in 17 years. Shaq joins 96. Championships. Then 8 years removed from repeat championships, a top three player ever joins your team and makes sure the Lakers also trade for the best PF in the game?   The most spoiled, delusional fan base of all time.   How is this comment upvoted? In the past three years you’ve had LeBron James and Anthony Davis decide to come play for you. Not even a decade removed from back-to-back titles.   Lakers have had by far the most stacked group of stars to play for their team throughout the entire modern history of the NBA and continue to easily attract the best players in the league simply for being the LA Lakers. LeBron joined them as one of the worst teams in the league. No North American sports franchise has had an easier time winning over the past 50 years than the Lakers. Maybe the Yankees."
"LeBron James is nothing like Malone.   Karl Malone barely shot outside of the paint and didn’t pass NEARLY as much as Lebron. Meanwhile Lebron James shoots everywhere, and is a point forward.  Trae Young is also not that similar to Stockton, but its whatever, seeing as Lebron will retire before Trae leaves the Hawks"
Do you know what MVP stands for? If you do then I can’t see how you think Lebron should not have won. If you think Andre fucking Igodala was a more valuable basketball player than Lebron James in that series you need to check your self into a mental institution.    I’m not an advocate of best player on floor wins year in year out but that series is an exception due to the obvious.
I'm LeBron James and you're watching Univision
"What does this complaint come out to really? Lebron is so good and so marketable that he is able to convince guys to want to play with him? It almost sounds like you’re seeing these guys as reluctant followers who just can’t resist when Lebron comes calling. I’m lost here about what we are complaining about. Players aren’t joining up with Lebron against their better judgement and James isn’t secretly controlling things. It’s pretty open that players recruit each other and that the best players have extra sway. There was nothing secret about Lebron and AD. There was nothing secret about them recruiting Kawhi. He’s very openly looking for players to team up with and other guys too. Those guys who are good enough to attract other stars, that’s an earned and acknowledged advantage. I’m not seeing the conspiracy."

"Sure, except that he’s not scoring with poor efficiency. Actually his efficiency is better than that of Lebron James, his defensive rating also much closer to league average than to “godawful”. He’s leading the leagues best offense, putting up top tier raw number and has the mavs in a good position going into the post season. I think there is absolutely a case to be made that he isn’t a superstar, but to say he’s not in the company of the others you referred to a “fringe” is ridiculous."
LeBron James is:   👑 My Don   🐴 My Message   🇮🇹 My Family   🥩 My Gabagool    🔫 My Shooter   🍝 My Guts
He didn't lose by 15. He lost because the refs called a [bullshit charge on him](https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-foul-call-charge-baffling-finals-game-1-2018-6). But yea a loss is a loss
"NBA ShootOut 2004 was released for the PlayStation in September 2003. I can’t find any player rosters for that game, but it probably included LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Kyle Korver. Also not sure if we want to include Jamal Crawford, Pau Gasol, and Nene since they’re technically not retired yet."
"You can hate him because he handed your favorite team too many losses. I mean, a Raptors fan even spelling out LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers is guaranteed to get 4 Ls. Hate and respect are not mutually exclusive - you can hate someone for their actions, but respect them for their ability to enact those actions and the manner in which they conduct them."
**Note: [Both games will air on TNT](https://pressroom.warnermediagroup.com/us/media-release/tnt-tip-return-2019-20-nba-season-lebron-james-anthony-davis-kawhi-leonard-paul)**
Well I was told that Klutch exists solely to appease Lebron James and that all players represented will eventually be brainwashed into helping him or joining the team soooooo
Son: Steph Curry  Father: Lebron James
It’s an opportunity to associate their brand with LeBron James. Lakers are somewhat relevant here but Klutch is still growing business with one of the GOATs of the game. It’ll most likely be a smart decision down the line.
"lmao, so you think lebron james leaves the bubble and returns he is going to be made to stay in his room for 14 days?"
"Idk man as a fellow warriors fan I would pick the rockets over both LA teams and the Bucks.   Lakers win, Lebron gets a fourth, no thank you   Clippers win, I’m not passionately opposed to but you better believe most people will happily vault Kawhi over Steph   Bucks win destroys the (already infinitesimal) possibility that Giannis comes to the Dubs   Rockets are the safest for my fan ego haha. Besides, I never understood the frothing at the mouth hatred people few toward James Harden. Seems like a good dude and foul baiting aside, he does things no one else in the league can do. It’s also funny thinking about a team that is literally censored out of the league in China winning the championship. Like, how do you get around that one as a censor?"
So they set it up in a way that Michael Jordan played Kobe Bryant and Lebron James before the Semi-Finals were even done?  Good bracketing.
"Good post.  A theory I have related to this:  The more loosely dribbling is called as the league continues to evolve, the more advantageous it is for teams to play very tall primary ballhandlers.  Tall guys like Harden, Lebron, and Luka can delay their gather longer than short guys can.  They also take longer strides on their stepbacks, and can see over defenders better than short guys can.    The theoretical advantage of a small point guard is that it is harder to steal the ball from him, and he can handle the ball better.  But given that the league (rightly, imo) allows the Durant crossover and Giannis' Eurosteps and the stepbacks and delayed gather of Lebron/Luka/Harden...I think that should be considered a trend we'll see more and more of.    I think Chris Paul and Kyrie Irving will be the last of their kind.  Because someone that size in the NBA going forward will only make it in the league if they are a prolific off-the-dribble 3-point shooter.  I would never draft a 6'3"" and under guy again if he wasn't an elite off-the-dribble three-point shooter as an amateur.   To be clear, I'm saying this because I feel the evolution of dribbling has advantaged taller guys, because the way pretty much all of them dribble would've been a carry in previous eras.  The relaxed dribble rules enable tall guys to handle the ball in a PnR.    If I was a rebuilding team and didn't have a PG I would not draft a Darius Garland, Colin Sexson type in the lottery.  And that includes several of this year's top prospects.  It makes more sense to me to put the ball in the hands of a few taller guys on your G-league team in the season prior, and good decision makers on your NBA roster, in hopes of raising your team's defensive floor and finding a diamond-in-the-rough nontraditional ball handler, like James Johnson was for Miami a few years ago (basically going from almost out of the league to a 4 year, $60M contract)."
"i still hate Lebron James because he lied about being ""zero dark thirty"" in the playoffs. he liked a picture on instagram from perfectbooties and expected us to not notice"
Can they create an NBA game where the NBA doesn't suppress speech in support for human rights and where Lebron James doesn't fully support the suppression of free speech?
"WHAT IF: The ping pong balls gave the Grizzlies #1 when it came down to them and Cleveland in the LeBron draft—instead, Memphis got #2 and the pick, thus unprotected, went to the Detroit Pistons as part of a previous trade.  BONUS: What if Memphis hadn’t drafted Hasheem Thabeet and instead snagged Steph Curry or James Harden to play alongside Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, and Marc Gasol?"
"They have to give The Lakers and LeBron the ring at the risk and cost of the health of the rest of the league! Hope it's worth it to you, King James!"
Do you seriously expect me to believe that Lebron James and Anthony Davis can find a way to win without one of their role players? No fucking way.
Your logic doesn’t make sense though is my point. I’m not arguing whether Kobe is overrated or not.   You: Kobe is overrated. People not agreeing with me proves my point.   Me: Michael Jordan and Lebron James are overrated. People not agreeing with me proves my point.   You: I don’t agree with that.
Michael Jordan and Lebron James are overrated by your definition then because not of a lot of people think they’re overrated.
"&gt; People disagreeing w me just adds to my point that he’s overrated.   That’s not how that works. You’d have to be right in order for people disagreeing with you for that statement to make sense.   “Lebron James and Michael Jordan are overrated. People disagreeing w me just adds to my point that he’s overrated.”  See, that doesn’t make sense does it?"
"The Grizzlies could have been so good if that had happened.  PG = Jason Williams  SG = Mike Miller  SF = Lebron James  PF = Pau Gasol  C = Lorenzen Wright  The Grizzlies went 28-54 in the 2002-03 season. They went on to win 50 games in 2003-04 season with a starting lineup of Williams, Miller, James Posey, Pau, and Wright. Posey was a good player and a great defender, but replacing him with Lebron James would have been massive.   They likely don't win a title for a couple of years as Lebron grows, but that team would be really good, better than any of Lebron's early Cavs teams."
Tony Parker  Manu Ginobili  LeBron James  Tim Duncan  David Robinson
"""having a discussion with my MANY FRIENDS and I just wanna know... why does NOBODY but ME think that LeBron James is good at basketball???"""
"Would you rather add to your team:  - LeBron James   - Jamal Murray, 35 year old Paul Millsap, Gary Harris and Will Barton  Honestly LeBron James is more impactful than decent role players. He makes a gigantic difference"
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

Lebron James? I’m the ONLY Ty Crane!
No love for JR trying to score around Melo sprawled on the floor?  Ricky Davis missing on his own basket for a triple double.  Darius Miles saying LeBron would have to get with what the Cavs were doing.  Derrick Rose cutting his arm on a knife while attempting to eat an apple.  Honourable mention: Delonte West sleeping with Gloria James.
"Carmelo will be remembered as one of the greatest scorers in league history. His scoring arsenal is only matched by KD, Kobe, MJ, etc... If he had the same talent around him as say a Lebron James (Kyrie, Dwade, Klove, etc.) or a KD (I mean warriors c'mon man) then he'd have MULTIPLE titles. If he had real talent around him during those knicks years, he wins a title easy (probably 2013)."
"just wondering did the spurs just stop trying to play defense if they're up 15 in the 3rd quarter or the 2nd quarter?   And you didn't really even respond to what I said. Kawhi was not responsible for getting anybody else involved offensively, he had a plays run for him and iso's mixed but he was not the guy that needed to spoon feed every possession to his team, he did not need to create offense for anyone else. That was manu and Parker's job, thats why you see them with most of the turnovers on their team.  Yes he played incredibly, but its not really an apples to apples comparison. It'd be like like comparing james harden to klay thompson. Yeah thompson might have some hyper efficient series where he scores 25+ points and plays great defense, but hes not being guarded like a #1 option because of the other threats on his team.  I mean can we imagine how Kawhi would've fared in lebron's role? He likely would've scored more volume than he did on San Antonion but I don't see Miami even winning one game with Kawhi and lebron switched."

" Gem of a comment by the creator of this video, breaking down exactly what happened:  ""If you have eyes and watched the series, LeBron carried the offense. 28ppg on insane efficiency""    I did watch the series (not just copy paste the box score stats), and LeBron didn't carry anything. After Game 2, LeBron scored 51 of his 81 points (63%) in Games 3-4-5 after losing by 15+, nearly 2/3    Video Footage ""Was LeBron James Truly Effective in the 2014 Finals?"" - [youtu.be/Y02r-Dz5cMw?t=160](http://youtu.be/Y02r-Dz5cMw?t=160)    at the [2:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APGlNxSvODw&amp;t=160s) mark Spurs leading by 15 points or more 141 total points for LeBron 51 scored in blowout situations    However, the Heat were never losing by 15+ with LeBron on the court in Games 1-2 of the Finals. So those 51 points in blowout situations (down 15+) all came in Games 3-4-5 when LeBron scored a total of 81 points.      ""For the rest of the series, the heat were down by 15+ by halftime.. so what should lebron do?""    You're ignoring that Lebron only had 3 points in the 2nd quarter which led to them losing after halftime, and even with Lebron doing nothing in the 2nd quarter they were only down 7 at halftime.     Then LeBron never scored again until they were down 21 with [4:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APGlNxSvODw&amp;t=280s) left in the 3rd quarter. LeBron waited till the late 3rd quarter before he scored again and they were already down 21.    Its LeBron's own passiveness is the main reason that led them to getting blown out down the stretch.     so what should lebron do? He should have been more aggressive in the 2nd and 3rd quarters when the games were in reach, instead of waiting until they were down 21 late in the 3rd quarter when the chance of coming back is pretty much 0.    and his offense is only half the game, his defense was atrocious     The majority of LeBron's stats over the last 3 games were padded in blowout situations (being down 15+). LeBron by no means was ""carrying"" his team in these Finals.  And he got outplayed by Kawhi Leonard over the last 3 games    Games 3-4-5   Lebron scored 51 of his 81 points (63%) being down 15+    Leonard scored 27 of his 71 points (38%) being up 15+   Leonard outscored Lebron 44-30 in non-blowout situations     &amp;#x200B;   Leonard 23.7 ppg on 69%   LeBron 27.0 ppg on 55% (Leonard 14% more efficient)    And again, Lebron stats were heavily padded in garbage time, in non blowout situations Leonard outscored him     Leonard 9.3 rpg   LeBron 7.7 rpg    &amp;#x200B;   Leonard 2.0 spg   LeBron 1.7 spg   &amp;#x200B;   Leonard 2.0 bpg   LeBron 0.7 bpg    &amp;#x200B;   Leonard 2.3 apg with 1.7 TOpg   LeBron 4.7 apg with 3.7 TOpg   Leonard had a slightly better ast:TO ratio     Through games 3-4-5, Leonard scored much more efficiently (and more in non blowout situations) and outrebounded, outstole, and outblocked Lebron with a better ast:TO ratio    Game 3   Lebron had 14 points and 0 TO in first quarter, then 8 points and 7 TOs for the last 3 quarters. LeBron had 22-5-7-5 with 7 TOs on 64%, Wade had 22-4-2-2 with 5 TOs on 67%. But over the last 3 quarters, LeBron had 8 points and 7 TOs to Wade's 20 points and 3 TOs. The Heat cut the lead from 15 to 9 without LeBron, after Wade subbed in for him, from the [5:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APGlNxSvODw&amp;t=300s) to [1:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APGlNxSvODw&amp;t=60s) mark of the 3rd quarter, but even with that help LeBron still lost.    Game 4   Lebron had 9 points in first half and the Heat were blown out by 19 at halftime. He padded his stats from there, and did not score on Leonard in the first half.    Game 5   LeBron had 17 in the first quarter, a good start. Then Lebron had 1 FG in 2nd quarter ([2:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APGlNxSvODw&amp;t=150s) mark) to bring the Heat within 5. Then he did not score again until the Heat were down 21 with [4:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APGlNxSvODw&amp;t=280s) in the 3rd. After the 1st quarter, LeBron disappeared just like in Game 3    He shot 1-6 against Leonard in this game according to ESPN ""MVP Leonard Does it All,"" and according to that same article Leonard shot 65% on LeBron's overrated defense for the overall series  - [http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/\_/id/91529/mvp-leonard-does-it-all](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&amp;stzid=UgjEI97W81QsQXgCoAEC.89251dDul3Y8I7gqIGqYmk&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fespn.go.com%2Fblog%2Fstatsinfo%2Fpost%2F_%2Fid%2F91529%2Fmvp-leonard-does-it-all&amp;redir_token=DwWZHwy71vs17sj3cvj25gxDyXp8MTU5MzIyODE5OUAxNTkzMTQxNzk5)     Leonard clearly outplayed Lebron over the final 3 games, even with Lebron padding his stats, and Lebron failed to score consistently until after his teams were getting blown out. LeBron did not play well in the 2014 Finals after Game 2, he only padded his stats. LeBron's 2014 Finals was a repeat of the 2011 Finals after Game 2, the only differences being that LeBron's teammates disappeared along with him, and LeBron padded his stats to save face. So any notion that LeBron had an ""amazing"" series, and still lost because of his teammates is false.    NO ONE else from the heat showed up in this finals.     15 ppg on 44% from Wade   14 ppg on 55% from Bosh  isn't even bad help. This excuse is getting way too old.    Jordan's tops 2 scoring teammates, 1996-1998 Finals    Pippen 17.1 ppg on 39%   Kukoc 12.1 ppg on 45%    Jordan won with less offensive help in his last 3 Finals than LeBron did in 2014, while playing from ages 33-35 well past his prime. The Bulls were better defensively, which had a lot to do with Jordan himself playing great defense on Payton and Stockton unlike LeBron getting lit up by Kawhi Leonard and outplayed the last 3 games.       Had you replaced LeBron with Jordan, the Heat would have easily beaten the Spurs, who went 7 games against the 8-seed and top 10 worst defensive Mavs, in 5 or 6 games, with Jordan shutting down Kawhi Leonard who only had 13 ppg in the regular season and not resorting to padding his stats in blowout situations."
Daddy Garand to protect Lebron James :P
"I'd argue that Steph has more value on a Durant team than Wade does. Remember, we're starting KD and benching the other player.  Wade was the right guard for his era, as a slashing 2-guard without a serious 3-point shot. But his game would not age perfectly as a costar past 2016-17 or so. Spacing is incredibly valuable, and Wade did not have range. In his Heatles run, he had the benefit of being surrounded by a roster with LeBron on his best shooting years, Chris Bosh, and Ray Allen. If he isn't guaranteed teammates like these, he and KD could certainly out-talent other teams like Westbrook and KD did, but it's not the same thing as having a good offensive fit. A Wade + bench lineup without KD might look more like Giannis vs the Raptors, where the star gets swarmed in the paint and the role-players can't make plays.  Steph, on the other hand, is a very modern offensive player in that he can shoot from anywhere, off the dribble if necessary. Moreover, he's not as ball-dominant, but can consistently put up 25+ PPG while sharing the court with a 25+ PPG scorer such as, say, Kevin Durant, and maybe even another 20 PPG scorer on top of that. Steph's skills scales much better in a star-studded team, while Wade's contributions (defense, slashing/playmaking) are significantly more contextual, since they require the majority of his teammates to provide defense and spacing. Individual perimeter defense doesn't mean squat if the offense can easily get a match with a much worse player. And when surrounded by ideal teammates, Curry can be the engine of a 73-win team, whereas Wade peaked at 66, while playing second fiddle to LeBron James.  Plus, Steph has some pretty good bench celebrations."
"Yeah bro, the Mavericks were some revolutionary all-time great squad and only they could figure out how to stop LeBron James.  LeBron has been in the league for 17 years and nobody could do that, but the Mavs with the greatest coaching staff in NBA history were able to do so, mad props.  Seriously, what an insufferable fan base incapable of admitting that the only reason they got a title was due to LeBron choking like a motherfucker in that NBA Finals.  Sucks that they didn't play the Heat in the next year then, they would've held LeBron to 17 ppg again and would've not gotten swept in the first round."
"Nah, i watched the series and it was clear as day that if LeBron had even an average LeBron series the Mavs would've been swept.  It was a choke job, we have never seen LeBron play that bad before or after and it STILL took 6 games for the Mavs to win. Heat were the best team in the league, it just happened that in the series against the Mavs their best player was at his absolute worst.  Mark Cuban and Mavs fans love to act like they did some revolutionary stuff that held LeBron freaking James to 17 ppg on 47% FG and they just didn't, if LeBron could be stopped to this degree he wouldn't be one of the five greatest players to ever play the sport.  LeBron choked and the Mavs took full advantage of it, how hard is this to admit?"
Lebron never won a ring without James Jones so I think we all know who the real J GOAT is
"&gt;[HE THINKS ABOUT it all the time: What if he hadn't worn a throwback? What if he had worn Polo the way he did most days? He loved Polo, and not just the shirts.

LeBron James in his 5th prime.
"LeBron James not showing up in the 4th quarter for four straight games sparked the comeback in that series. Terry was good, but to act like he was the reason alongside Dirk that the Mavs won is plain bullshit.  Heat were a far better team, one of their stars and MVP caliber players just decided to not show up and score 8 points in a pivotal Game 4/disappear everytime there was 12 minutes left in the game."
Get ready for the onion article.   “Police officer in Disney almost shoot a black man in a hoodie. Turned out to be Lebron James coming back from practice”
"I think the LeBron James-era Miami teams executed this concept really well with the inclusion of Chris Bosh.   Chris was either the one both Dwyane and LeBron could blame for their shortcomings, or the one that kept the two levelheaded and dominant. I'm not saying a rift between LeBron and Dwyane 100% would have occurred without Bosh; I'm saying his presence kept the two from ever having to go down a bad path.   He picked up for the two of them when they had off days, and they picked up for him when he had a 1/18 shooting night. Dwyane Wade and LeBron James were the clear stars and Chris Bosh was the glue that aligned them.  Oklahoma City had James Harden in a prime position to be their glue, but they traded him. Without him, OKC didn't have their glue, and off went Durant to Golden State. It exploded.  Minnesota needs their glue."
Comparing PEDs and steroids to a private workout in terms of cheating is just so exaggerated and dramatic. If any team isn’t working out in some way together then they deserve to get dusted in the playoffs because they really don’t want it. I’ll never say players getting together and putting more work in than the next is cheating. I’m sorry but lebron James self quarantining won’t end Covid 19 and it works in the opposite way that them privately working out isn’t gonna be the cause of an outbreak. It’s not like these guys are out publicly doing this shit and putting everyone at risk. The league gave a date so these players should do whatever it takes to be ready by then.    Also the whole well everybody is doing it so why shouldn’t I is a good argument when you’re just talking about the general public. These dudes are locked up in a gym not walking through the streets infecting everyone
"Vince had to settle jumpers after being more injury prone &amp; diminishing athleticism. He continued with that even at New Jersey Nets. It was a necessity for the sake of longevity. All players have to reinvent their play style, not everyone is LeBron James who is still amazing at attacking the rim even at 35 years of age. Vince made a game-winning shot against Portland Trail Blazers in one of those games where he had a 20+ points game. Is it also ""quitting""? left the games early due to nagging injuries where he only scored fewer points. Vince was never great at FT% &amp; players can have slumps with their shooting.  Again, Vince's stats looks worse due to other things than him ""giving up""."
Is Vince Carter better than Lebron James? Skip Bayleess with the hot take tonight
Lebron James is just an athletic Draymond Green with better offense and worse defense  Luke Kennard would be an allstar if he got more playing time and wasn’t white   Giannis will join the Warriors
"Its simple, Lebron James will not pander.  He knows the plight of the common man.  He sees every day (from his limo or helicopter) the struggles that people go through, and can speak to us on a much more real level.  His first movie is going to be a non-pandering Chinese propaganda piece."

"Now you will get the opportunity to be pandered to, ignored and underserved by NBA Legend LeBron James"
CAN LEBRON JAMES CONTAIN JASON TERRY
"""underserved""?  I don’t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Lebron James, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand"
"&gt; **~~LeBron James is building a new media company that aims to give a voice to Black creators and consumers who’ve been pandered to, ignored, or underserved.~~**   Lebron James is building a new media company that aims to make lots of money, produce wealth and employ friends  FTFY"

"&gt;&gt; On March 11, the same day the NBA suspended its season and a little more than a week before their adopted hometown ordered residents to shelter in place, James and Carter formed the SpringHill Co. after raising $100 million. They describe it as a media company with an unapologetic agenda: **a maker and distributor of all kinds of content that will give a voice to creators and consumers who’ve been pandered to, ignored, or underserved.**  A bit inaccurate to say Lebron is only helping black peoples, right?"
Man! Our all time prime team could go toe to toe with anyone- assuming everyone is in their prime.  PG: Derrick Rose  SG: Dwayne Wade  SF: Lebron James  PF: Shawn Kemp  C: Shaq
"LeBron James is motivated by money. You will be disappointed if you expect long term altruism from him. That's not to say that helping disenfranchised communities won't be a byproduct of this endeavor, but it will ultimately be shown to be a financially motivated decision.  Lower your expectations in accordance with his past behaviors and you probably won't be disappointed."
James harden. Great player but he’s not LeBron good where he can win a title by himself. He needs some help but doesn’t take to much of it. He will always win at least 1-2 series per playoffs
"Holy shit we get it: you don't like that LeBron James, the basketball billionaire, wore a three piece Thom Browne suit with shorts instead of trousers  Why fucking care when y'all only have a vague interest in fashion anyway?

"*red laser appears on Dwight's head*  &gt;""Ugh.... I can't wait to support the greatest basketball player of all time, LeBron James, in his quest for another championship.

"&gt; that's like saying Manu is better than Shaq cause he has a more diverse game  The qualifier was 'to the same success and accolades'. Manu did not achieve that level of production or success, and so it is irrelevant. This is more related to why Russell Westbrook is considered better than Oscar Robertson.  &gt; this has nothing to do with their basketball abilities  Yes -- it speaks to the first item above, and is driven by the value of the mid-range. Second, this is used as last-bullet value points, and intended not to be the strongest reason.  &gt; i have no idea how 08 olympics proves he was the best player longer than Duncan was.  Ok. Here is the subtext. Most people on this sub will not give you 2008 as Kobe Bryant being the best player in the game. They might give you 2005-2006, exclusively. In the 2008 Olympics, the top 10-12 players in the league were on the Olympic Team. This includes Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, etc. In the only competitive game during the only competitive moments, all players completely deferred to Kobe Bryant. This indicates that, in fact, Kobe Bryant may have actually been the best player in the league during that time, quite possibly for a minimum of a 3 season span. This is backed by coaches' surveys during the time period, as well as the resounding testimony of players and player interviews.  &gt; You know who also has great PER and advanced stats that aren't bigs? Wade, Lebron, Curry, CP3, Harden, KD, Westbrook, MJ, Bird, Magic. Wade, Lebron, CP played at the same time Kobe did (~'03 - '11 if you wanna compare same era stats).  Ok, so PER is the one you want to go with. Tim Duncan's highest PER season is BELOW Kobe Bryant's highest PER season. PER is among the weakest of metrics, and by your own admission, in that case all those players you listed are better than both Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant. Is that true? No. Then why fucking bring it up at all?  His advanced metrics are NOT lagging that far behind other all time greats is the first thing, but the point is that the formulation for most of those metrics weight specific things very clearly. In fact, many are also intended to put MJ seasons at the top -- as part of self-validation. If I create a metric and the season I expect to pop up on top does, it must be a valid metric. You can read about their distributions in their configuration in bballref. Many are patterned after a specific season prototype.  What YOU and others need to ask yourself is, if all of these metrics paint so many other players as so good:  1. Why do we only use them to disparage Kobe's rankings? Forget Kobe vs. Tim Duncan. Why not Lebron vs. Chris Paul? Why not Charles Barkley vs. Shaq? That's the picture that these advanced stats paint.  2. Why do these metrics not clearly translate to Kobe's obvious success, or winning basketball? 5 championships? 2 FMVP? Where are Barkley's? Stockton's / Malone's? Chris Paul's? Harden's? We saying we can replace Kobe with these players on each of the championship runs and they win? It's laughable.  &gt; It's hard for me to believe you love Tim Duncan to death, but use such weak and incorrect arguments.  You've confused your own misunderstanding and weak arguments for mine; you don't even have a cohesive understanding of what you personally value in a player, and don't even have clear understanding of the aggregate metrics you're using.  &gt; He never lost in embarrassing fashion in the playoffs.  2001 Western Conference Finals.  - Game 3, to go down 3-0. Lakers: 111, Spurs: 72. Tim Duncan: 3-14, -27 box.  - Game 4, elimination. Lakers: 111, Spurs: 82. Result: Lakers win, sweep, 4-0. Tim Duncan: 5-10, -17 box.  Seems like you're full of shit and probably didn't watch either play in their respective primes. You're literally just making things up.  &gt; Also you mention head to head matchups. In 2003/04 the Lakers spent 20M more on their salaries.  I didn't mention 2003/2004 in those head to head match-ups. But yeah, they won that one too. And Kobe led the team in that series as well.  &gt; In 2003 when the Spurs won, they won by having 10M less salary. To me that says way more. The Lakers couldn't beat a team that spent almost 15% less then they did.  Lmfao okay, whatever. How many team discrepancies are there based on salary? Who gives a shit. Some teams get good players and get to keep them on rookie contracts for a long time. Other teams have to dip into the cap to retain their RFAs. Other teams just need to pay more for star players.  Everything you've said is either irrelevant, contradictory, or straight up wrong. And you're calling me out for misinformation."

"[Here's](https://www.maxim.com/.image/t_share/MTU2MDgxMTc5Mjk1MDMzMDcy/lebron-james-suit-shorts-1.jpg) a better picture. Every time this sub brings it up people defend him, but I think he looks goofy as fuck. If those were full length pants he would great though. It's also fucking hilarious that that was the game that JR Smith fucked up against the Warriors. LeBron gets asked a bullshit question about WTF JR was thinking and he storms out of the press conference with his man purse and dressed like a 1950's British school boy. It completely ruins the dramatic effect."

Easy answer.  Lebron James
"Hell, even LeBron being on the Memphis Grizzlies would have been huge. LeBron James with Pau Gasol would have gone to the finals in the 2007-2010 range. They won 50 games with Pau in a super tough West, now throw a young LeBron on that team?"

"Magic Best PG, Mike best SG, LeBron James best SF, Tim best PF are all mostly undisputed at this point. The only real debatable one is C but I think it’s clearly Kareem given his entire career."
"LeBron James is the greatest player of all time, and no one will change my mind. In an all-time draft I’m picking him first every time."

"Steph Curry ($5) - Danny Green ($2) - LeBron James ($5) - Serge Ibaka ($2) - JaVale McGee ($1)  Defensively, Danny Green and LeBron are very good man defenders, and Serge + JaVale would be great rim protection.  Offensively, LeBron has a bunch of spacing to exploit with his passing (or to drive) and can run PnRs in so many ways. JaVale doesn't provide spacing but is a good lob finisher which will pair well with LeBron. On top of that you can have Curry running around off ball around Ibaka and Green screens where any of the players can pop, roll, rescreen, etc. and LeBron would find the right passes to exploit the defense."
"Lebron James should have been Finals MVP in 2015. Not Andre Iguodala, and certainly not Wardell Curry. The statistical gap between Iguodala and Lebron in the 2015 Finals was bigger than the gap between Iguodala and your pet fish."

"no it isnt, what?  he said manziel would be bigger IN CLEVELAND than lebron james  a) football is waaaaay more popular than basketball in cleveland  b) what had lebron done for cleveland? not win a championship and then left them to win championships somewhere else. oh, and he left in a fashion that made many clevelanders hate him."
"Yup, but that's a far cry from thinking he'll be bigger than Lebron James."
LeBron James got his feelings hurt and suspended Draymond Green in 2016 finals
"NBA should continue at 2021 and do something to enforce battling the corona situation.

"Probably. Precedent has been set with Kevin Garnett. He played, what. . . . 6 seasons in Boston and that apparently was enough to get his number retired.   Used to be an accomplishment to get your number retired. You either played your whole career with a team or you were a highly accomplished player during your tenure with the team.   Outside of 2008. . . Which, I’ll admit was a huge year for Garnett. . . He was All NBA 1st Team and All Defensive 1st Team, DPOY and the Celtics won a title. . . was his tenure in Boston good enough to have his number retired?   I’d argue its close. . . But I’d lean towards no. It’s the Celtics. . . . Not the Kings.   With that said. . . my guess is even if LeBron doesn’t win a title in LA, they’ll still retire his number because it’s LeBron James.   Guess the times are a changin"
"The problems with Melo were clear from seeing him in collage, everybody drafting him over Lebron James was a flat out moron."
"LeBron - 7 Smart - 2 Tatum - 4 OG - 1 Turner - 1  If I'm going to have any chance against these power houses, I'm going to need 3 things: 5 3pt shooters, 5 lockdown defenders, and of course LeBron James. This lineup is seamlessly switchable except for maybe turner. I could be convinced to switch him for JJJ for better perimeter d though."
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people. and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."

"&gt;he played with 16 hof’ers,  Underrated because people use this as a slight against him.   Bill was the only all-time great who could play with that many HOF'ers. His game had 2 core elements:  1. Pushing the pace to breakneck speeds which created more scoring opportunities for his teammates 2. Breaking teams with his defence, which stopped the fast-paced games from just becoming shoot outs  This meant everyone on his team had more possessions to play with than anyone else. Because they got a lot of shots, they also got a lot of points. Because they got a lot of points, they got into the HOF.  The 5th-6th option on Michael Jordan or Lebron James' team wasn't averaging 15 FGA per game. The 5th-6th option playing next to Bill could.   Becoming a HOF player is one part talent and one part opportunity. The reality is, most star players suffocate their teammates' opportunities.   * Steve Kerr was never getting 15 FGA per game playing next to Michael Jordan because those shots had to go to Jordan.   * Danny Ainge was an all-star the year he finally got some shots of his own, up until then the shots had mostly gone to Bird and McHale.   Playing next to Russsell, those guys would have averaged 15-16 shots per game. Likewise:  * Tommy Heihnson was a HOF player next to Bill because he was scoring 20ppg on those championship teams. He wouldn't have scored all those points next to other top 10 players because he wouldn't have gotten 21 FGA and 5 FTA next to those other guys.   There are some all-time greats who are really good at using possessions for themselves (eg. Jordan). There are some all-time greats who are really good at using possessions to help their teammates (eg. Magic). Bill was exceptional because he didn't really use possessions, he created them. Which meant there were more opportunities for his teammates to succeed.   Criticising Bill for having a lot of HOF teammates is like criticising Jordan for being able to hit really tough shots. It shouldn't be a criticism, it's what made him great.   You couldn't fit 4-5 HOF'ers on a Jordan/LeBron/Bird/Magic/etc team.  ***   Wilt was one of the only players who came close in the sense he was creating extra possessions, but Wilt used those extra possessions for himself. That's how he managed all those crazy unbeatable individual records."
[under rated.  dude had unmatched size and athleticism. ](https://youtu.be/JWelUNrJUMM). I'm talking LeBron James like.
"I don’t think it’s possible under these rules. The Hampton 5 is $25, at least. The Bulls may not be $25, but Jordan, Pippin, Rodman are $17-$18 alone.  Here is the best I can do. You GOTTA have Lebron or Kawhi. Impossible without one of those two.  Lowry - $3 Robinson - $1 Lebron - $7 Siakam - $3 Whiteside - $1  Three proven winners. Three high level defenders in Lebron, Siakam and Whiteside. A pretty good defender at times in Lowry. Plus shooting from Robinson and Lowry with Siakam and James hitting 2+ 3s a game as well.  I still don’t think this team beats either the Dubs or the Bulls, but it’s what I can do at $15."
I’m telling my kids this was Lebron James
PG: DeAron Fox  SG: Buddy Hield  SF: LeBron James  PF: Paul Millsap  C: Brook Lopez
PG: LeBron James (7$) SG: Eric Gordon (1$) SF: Paul George (5$) PF: PJ Tucker (1$) C: Marc Gasol (1$) OR Myles Turner (1$)
$3:  C Bam Adebayo $7: PF LeBron James $3: SF Jaylen Brown $1: SG Eric Gordon $1: PG Fred VanVleet
Lebron James?? 🤔🤔
What if Jan Vesely was Lebron James?
"On point! I'd pick this team over the Redeem Team on any given night.  No one is checking their big man rotation. If the Redeem Team opts to go fast, Lenny Wilkens can have David Robinson and Scottie Pippen to match up against a likely 4-5 combo of Dwight Howard and LeBron James.   This team has defenders at all positions. They've got shooters and elite creators in Grant Hill and Penny."
Your idol LeBron James has 3 cases of racism in the past 18 months alone. You've got bigger problems
"-They put up a statue of Donald Sterling  -They put up a statue of Kobe, but it's him taking a shit. They include the shit  -They give Lebron James Jr a statue before either Kobe or Lebron. Or before he's played in the NBA"
"I'm not saying he has to be a ""traditional"" PG. But his impact both in winning and advanced stats is nowhere near what his raw numbers suggest.   He played with 2 of the all-time greats in OKC, albeit early in their careers. Durant was already an all-time level player, and Harden an exceptional 6th man. It's not a stretch at all to suggest that with those elements in place that a merely solid PG could be swapped for Westbrook and you still have a finals capable team.   Let me ask you something else. Let's pretend for a moment that I could see the future and I told you that there was a player in the draft this year that would average a triple double for the next 3 years. You'd move heaven and earth to acquire him. You'd think this guy is Lebron James on steroids, an automatic ticket to contend every year. So something doesnt add up, it's about time people considered what it is about us solo act that really only produces great results for himself.  You don't have to buy the idea that making bystanders of the other 4 guys is bad for winning basketball but the fact is the results for his team are very underwhelming."
&gt;It will take ~~a superstar like Giannis~~ LeBron James getting affected for the NBA to shit this down.  FTFY
LeBron James doesn't have a father because Gloria was used in a government experiment to conceive a genetically modfied freak of nature.
lebron james........
"At no point has Harden been better than Steph.   Not sure why a high usage rate and taking a shitton of shots to get inflated stats has somehow catapulted James Harden into the upper echelon for some people. He has never been in the same category as LeBron, KD, Steph, and Kawhi.   Sounds harsh, but it's true. He has no crowning achievement when it really mattered, and he's had opportunities. He had a better team than Steph when KD went down and CP3 was healthy. He couldn't extend the series, much less win it. Steph instead came up big and won it."
"KD 2013: 28/8/5 on 64% TS   Steph 2015: 24/4/8 on 64% TS      KD beats Steph in 4 out of 5 advanced categories (PER, WS, WS/48, VORP), KD had an MVP season in 2013, he just got unlucky to get stuck behind a peak Lebron James."
"Players with 800+ games to average at least 13.5 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 1.4 SPG, 49% FG and 30% 3FG?  Magic Johnson  Larry Bird  Michael Jordan  LeBron James  ***Thad Young***"
"You don’t think LeBron James, who is 2nd in the running’s for MVP, will get first team?"
"Only 5 rookies have ever averaged 20-5-5. Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Luka Doncic,   And Tyreke Evans."
"What kind of logic is that? The IT Celtics were a better defensive team than offensive, their elite defence was very obviously not the reason they failed to make the Finals.  This is absurd goalpost shifting. A shit defensive guard makes the Finals as the best player on his team, doesn’t count because it was too long ago. Another shit defensive guard makes five straight finals trips and wins three rings, well the other team had injuries in the first one, he lost the second one (ignore the once-in-a-lifetime comeback that caused that) and he had too much help for the next two. Then he beat another team lead by *two* shit defensive guards but they weren’t real contenders so it doesn’t count. Then another shit defensive guard was the best player on an elite defensive team but that doesn’t count because he didn’t make the Finals, losing to a pretty average defensive team instead.  You can write off basically any player archetype that isn’t “literally LeBron James” if your criteria is *that* strict."
"If he would have left it at ""**LeBron James and Stephen Curry were born in the same Akron hospital**"", I would've been like ""hmm, didn't know that, pretty cool"", but he just made it weird."
"He’s done it twice, and the first time he just got swept because he was coaching a clearly inferior team against prime LeBron James.   I’m honestly amazed that series still gets held against him, like taking a Horford/Millsap-lead team to the ECF while making Kyle Korver and Jeff Teague look like stars is a bad thing."
"In 2014, the three best players in the NBA were Kevin Durant (won MVP), LeBron James (duh), and Blake Griffin.  It's a shame BG had to be all-NBA 2nd team since he/KD/LeBron are all forwards."
You know what's funny? If LeBron wins there will be several threads asking if he's the GOAT so if Kawhi is so close to passing LeBron James how close is he to being the fuckin GOAT? Smh y'all care something else
"LeBron James and Stephen Curry were born in the same ~~Akron hospital~~ Genetic Lab in Akron exactly 1,170 days apart."
"Also OP:  https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/gpb7gx/why_couldnt_lebron_overcome_against_kdwarriors/ hy couldn't LeBron overcome against KD-Warriors like Dirk could on Miami Heat in 2011?  &gt;LeBron James is a phenomenal player and is maybe the ""top 1 player in NBA"".  However, LeBron was gentleman swept against KD-Warriors in 2017.  Keep in mind that Cavs were a legitimate superteam with 3 All-Star calibers players (LeBron/Kyrie/Love), which is equal footing like GSW who also had 3 All-Star caliber players (KD/Steph/Klay). Also, the Cavs were among favorites to win NBA Championship 2017.  On the other hand, Dirk and Dallas Mavericks were massive underdogs in literary every matchup. And unlike LeBron, he had 0 All-Star caliber players on their teams. And yet, Dirk was able to overcome the advertises and defeated Miami Heat with LeBron/Wade/Bosh at their primes.  As the title says, why couldn't LeBron overcome KD-Warriors like Dirk did on Miami Heat in 2011?"
"Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Shaq  Bench: Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, James Worthy, Anthony Davis, Wilt Chaimberlain  Lakers Win"
"Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Lebron James, Nikola Jokic, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Ja Morant, Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant"
Lebron James. No reason.
Yeah and that’s why there will be a clear difference between Danny Green doing it vs Lebron James.
Steph's first MVP is kinda weak. KD has had multiple seasons better than 2015 Steph he just got unlucky to get stuck behind prime Lebron James.
"Stephen A also had LeBron and Bosh to Miami a week before the decision and people called him crazy.   &gt; On his radio show on June 28, Smith said ""Youre only as good as your sources, as a journalist, and from what Im being told, after hearing what everybody has to say, LeBron James will agree to team with Dwyane Wade, hes going to South Beach. LeBron James and Chris Bosh are going to South Beach; they are going to play for the Miami Heat.

Lebron James Harden.
Lebron because I never like to cheer for the best lol. James harden because while I respect his game I absolutely hate it. Zion because I respect his game but hate the constant attention he gets.
"What you just said doesn't make any sense. Melo's rookie stats were better than Lebron's. &gt;One might be surprised to see both of these player’s rookie stats. They both had incredible rookie numbers which are not hard to believe. What can be hard to believe is that Melo got the best of Bron is more statistical categories than one would think. For James, he averaged 20.9 points, 1.6 steals, 5.9 assists, 5.5 rebounds per game while averaging an effective field goal percentage of 43.8. On the other hand, Anthony averaged21 points, 1.2 steals, and 6.1 rebounds per game while averaging an effective field goal percentage of 44.9. The advanced numbers are also interesting. LeBron would finish his rookie year with a win share number of 5.1. Melo would finish with a win share of 6.1.  &gt;Melo would also outdo LeBron in the true shooting percentage category. Anthony would tally a true shooting percentage of 50.9 with James finishing with 48.8. Melo and LeBron would also finish with similar offensive and defensive ratings. Anthony would finish with an offensive rating of 102 and a defensive rating of 105. James would finish with an offensive rating of 99 and a defensive rating of 104.  https://crownhoops.com/2020/03/27/why-melo-should-have-won-rookie-of-the-year-over-lebron"
Politicizing entertainment often times leads to people abandoning that form of entertainment.  While I agree LeBron James is aloud to have his opinion use his 0latform etc...the reality is moat people dont watch him for his opinion...they watch him because he is good at basketball.
"Lol he didn’t do it at 34,35 but did at 36 on the worlds biggest stage? Idk what kind of mental gymnastics you are doing to avoid noticing that but it’s amazing. His ppg for the season matches up with much of what he’s been doing for years and there’s is no real sign of a decline of Lebron James yet"
what the fuck. in what world do you live in that Tim Duncan was arguably as good as prime LeBron James in 2013?
And Bosh never averaged more than 15 a game in the finals and Wade scores over 20 ONE TIME in the 2014 finals while averaging 15 ppg  and Bosh never scored over 20 while averaging 13 ppg? Stop going off their Names and start looking into what they did. Lebron James CARRIED the Heat and Wade on his back during those 2 chips not the other way around. Did he need help to win? Yes. Did Michael Jordan win SHIT until he got Scottie Pippen? NO. Did Kobe Bryant win finals MVP during his 3peat? NO. Point is all these great players need help to win it’s a team sport but it doesn’t apply to Lebron James he is the only player in NBA history expected to put up splits of 110-45-30 a night.
I mean the spurs also could not stop Lebron James in game 6 or 7 it was more than just a lucky break
Time to sell my Lebron James auto!! 😂
Do you think a young mike tyson could win 1 on 1 in basketball vs a 50 year old lebron james?
Okay bro and? The people he was fighting weren’t Lebron James.
What person in the entire world would pay that much for a LeBron James card?
"&gt;PS: try not to pick players like Giannis, LeBron, Ben Simmons, or James Harden as they are not your traditional point guards.. thanks.  Let's analyze this a bit, using basketballreference's Play-by-Play stats to help us understand how often these players play Point Guard.  Giannis makes sense here. Like Jokic, he is a distributor but zero of his minutes have appeared in the point guard slot.   Harden makes sense here too - partly that his minutes are mostly distributed between SG (40%) and SF (55%) and not PG (1%), but also that he plays beside a very traditional point guard in Russell Westbrook.  LeBron you could argue either way, I think. BBREF has 57% of his minutes as a PG.  Ben Simmons has 93% of his minutes assigned as PG. Why on earth would he not count?"
"""Sorry Lionel. I mean like, you ARE old, but not THAT old you know?""  \-HC Lebron James"
"If a fight like this ever went ahead, I will look you up, bet you every cent you have that Tyson would wreck LeBron’s shit like a cannon ball in round one. Taking your money would be like taking candy from a baby.   The fight would never happen though, because LeBron James would never step foot in a ring with Mike Tyson...because LeBron James is not a total fucking idiot."
"Lmfao.   Lebron is not Wilder in ANY fighting situation. Jfc, there are professional fighters, that you know, train every fuckin day to fight that still can’t use their size / length effectively and you think a basketball player is magically gonna know what’s up? Holy shit.   LeBron James has probably never been in an actual fight his entire adult life (or maybe ever). Anyone that thinks he has even the slightest chance is a dead-set fucking idiot."
Bruh he’s a 50 year old man who would have to go up against a 250 pound 6 foot 8 Lebron James. Like the fuck is he realistically gonna do? Jab his way to a win? Hell no. He’s not gonna knock him out either. Lebron is Wilder in this situation and the only person who beat Wilder was somebody bigger than him and more skilled. Skill only gets you so far.
Imagine coming off a hard day of pre calc then having to guard Lebron James
"You literally said ""fame"".... The top table tennis player in the world is a superstar whether or not he or she is famous. Or rugby, or MMA, or bowling, etc. Fame has nothing to do with being a superstar. If everyone that knew who LeBron James was got sick and died he would still be a superstar."
They have this decent guy named Lebron James who plays point as well.
"Do me a favor and go watch the last 1:45 of the 2016 Finals Game 7, after LeBron's block. What you'll see:   \- Repeated bricks by Steph Curry, including at least one that draws no iron and 100% backboard.   \- LeBron James panicking when he gets a defensive rebound and handing it to Irving like a ticking bomb.   \- Irving going on a full-court 1 on 3 fast break with less than 30 seconds left, leaving his goddamn feet on the baseline against said 3 defenders with nowhere to go, nobody to pass to, fumbling the ball into the air and miraculously getting it back - it looks like a travel, really - and, flailing along the baseline, falling it out of bounds, throwing a desperation fling that luckily makes it to Kevin Love  \- Irving inexplicably driving 3/4 court, instead of running the clock down, with the Cavs up 3 and only 14 seconds left in the game (and 11 on the shot clocks)  \- LeBron missing a critical free throw  My take-away: players and coaches in 2020 are significantly better and smarter than they were in 2016.   Or, perhaps, the last minutes of Finals Game 7s are so incredibly pressure-packed and intensely competitive that the greatest minds and players in the game make mistakes."
Maxamillion711 on YouTube has a playlist highlighting the GOAT seasons of NBA superstars and so far:  - 2016 Stephen Curry  - 2014 Kevin Durant  - 2000 Shaq  - 2003/2006/2008 Kobe Bryant  - 1991/1998 Michael Jordan   - 2001 Allen Iverson  - 2003 Tracy McGrady  - 2013 LeBron James  have all been included in such a playlist if you’d like to enjoy and watch: https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4ZuN60nhu_gBFSd0T6ZBs31mPeIocfGn
" So even though Wade was apart of one of the greatest trios ever but because he didn’t have the role players that Harden has somehow Wade is better? Harden only has role players my guy, imagine Wade winning a ship w/o Shaq or Lebron... it’s never happening.   Harden is expected to be just as good as Wade yet he’s never had a player like either of the ones just mentioned. He has Westbrook right now and Chris Paul for the last few years but neither are better than what Wade had and Harden is still expected to have the rings that Wade has. Right now his center is 6’9” and because of what Harden (and towards the end of the regular season Westbrook) has done, they still have a shot to win the ship. You put prime Wade in the scenario and it wouldn’t be any more of a lock than Harden at winning anything this year.   Harden is also one of the greatest scorers we have ever seen and has one of the most deadly signature moves of all time with how good his step back is. We don’t say the same about Wade on offense unless someone asks “who’s on your top 5 greatest shooting SGs ever” instead of “who’s one of the top 5-10 scorers ever, any position?” Like we can w/ James Harden.   You’re right as well with saying that the Rockets almost beat the Warriors if CP3 doesn’t get hurt, that team was unstoppable and because of Harden they almost pulled it off. You put Wade in that situation and you still get the same outcome.   So yes, if Harden somehow pulls it off this year or next and gets Finals MVP he is going to be better than Wade and that’s not a disrespectful statement. Wade will (most likely) always be top 5 SGs ever but Harden passing him shouldn’t be looked at with disgust. If you don’t want to talk because of that, have a good 4th my guy!"
"KD won back in 2014 and Lebron is still in the top 5 MVP voting 6 of the last 7 years which means he’s still a threat to take it at any time. Oh and Harden has to deal w/ the greatest shooter of all time and someone they refer to as the Greek Freak who could become one of the best players ever, yet James harden is still holding his own.   Overkill means Wade had too many weapons so again you are proving my point that Wade had more fire power than Harden ever has. Harden was the 6th man when he had KD and Russ so that doesn’t count, now he has Russ again and he’s still amazing but no one believes the Rockets will win this year unless they both put the team on their backs. Howard was ass in Houston and the rest of the guys you mentioned are good but they’re role players at the end of the day. Wade is still above Harden but if Harden was to somehow win it this year or next and get Finals MVP he will move above Wade based on what he’s done already."
"&gt; really? like for Michael Jordan the guy that beats Lebron in almost everything statistically except things that relate to longevity the only argument you've heard is his mindset???  Not what I said. I said mindset is what I attribute as the primary reason why Jordan was GoAT. I've heard loads of arguments and I think most of them are flawed...  &gt; The only thing that LEBRON has going for him is play making and longevity. Jordan is a better scorer and better defensive player.   Here's where it starts. MJ is not better at either of these things than LeBron... He just has the mindset to do it all the time. If LeBron didn't ret on D in the regular season or just decided he wanted to score all the time I am pretty sure he could have averaged a much higher number of points.   &gt;He has more individual and team accolades than Lebron, yet the only thing you think he has going for him is his mindset?  Team accolades are not really a fair comparison point. MJ was arguably playing in an easier league than LeBron was. He honestly didn't have a lot of team accolades at all before Pippen came along, whereas LeBron was taking the Cavs to 60 wins with guys like Hughes and Big Z. Wasn't there even a guy named 'Booby'? It wasn't pretty what LeBron was being given to work with.  2011 is the biggest stain on LeBron's career and the primary reason why he doesn't get realistically considered on MJ's level. But I don't know how anything he's done after that can't be viewed as just as impressive as anything MJ did... The Spurs and Warriors were deeper, stronger teams than anything MJ ever had to go against by a healthy margin.  But sure, if you want to only look at scoring and use that as your criteria for who is better, then MJ takes it easily and we should really be arguing him or James Harden."
"The thing that Greek freak mentioned that this will be the hardest finals, he has a point. There will also be an off-court strategy of trying to not get infected. Better believe that there will be armed guards guarding LeBron James/holding him hostage in his room for 3 months lol"

"It's almost like LeBron James has more power to impact the world than a random redditer, wow"
"He's a GIANT piece of shit.   Most fans just know about him breaking news, so they love him.  [https://deadspin.com/how-the-nba-flushed-out-the-exec-leaking-memos-to-adria-1672199058](https://deadspin.com/how-the-nba-flushed-out-the-exec-leaking-memos-to-adria-1672199058)  [https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/why-anything-adrian-wojnarowski-writes-about-lebron-james-needs-to-be-ignored/71827#:\~:text=Four%20days%20before%20LeBron%20announced,contributes%20to%20his%20biased%20agenda.](https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/why-anything-adrian-wojnarowski-writes-about-lebron-james-needs-to-be-ignored/71827#:~:text=Four%20days%20before%20LeBron%20announced,contributes%20to%20his%20biased%20agenda.)  &gt;Four days before LeBron announced he was going to Miami, [Wojnarowski wrote](http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=aw-lebronfreeagency070410) that LeBron had decided to stay in Cleveland. His inability to get coveted information on the most important player in the NBA no doubt contributes to his biased agenda."
"I don't see how this is so hard to understand.  The reason why so many people are annoyed is because Lebron James and other famous black athlete went hard against Drew Brees when he didn't support 100% with BLM regarding the national anthem. Lebron was quite vocal about Drew Brees back then.   So now, when a member of his own community that plays in the same league as Drew Brees(in other words, its as relevant for Lebron) or former players from the NBA started posting and saying faaar worse things, I mean Desean literally thought he was quoting Hitler(!!), people expect Lebron to respond in similar fashion because of his past behaviour.  Like seriously. How hard is that to understand?"
"Why? I would never forget the day after the decision, WOJ writing a hit piece on Lebron James. When he was at Yahoo! WOJ wrote a hit piece every other month on James or one of his insiders."
"To me his good drastically outweighs his bad.  The HK stuff sucks and is a bad look for Lebron.  The D. Jackson/ S. Jackson stuff wreaks of Ignorance (especially Desean, S.Jax being worse for doubling down and thus making him a bigot in that regard).  As a black man I've heard these crackpot Jewish conspiracies before and its a gd shame that people still spout that stuff off.    It would be a real shame if people start using any of the aforementioned as a whataboutism when James does speak out against issues facing black people in an effort to silence him because they're with the ""all lives matter"" crew.  But alas, and I'm speaking in general, people already are."
"I’m tired of the whataboutism that your comment relies on. People — including those with James’ platform — are perfectly justified in only speaking on things that “cost them nothing.” Not everybody needs to be perfect in all spheres, least of all the political or social views that they exhibit publicly. Be grateful that LeBron is willing to amplify anything with his platform. Too many of his peers have not and will not."
"i really went from anti-lakers for the chip but now i want to see the meme team win it all and we get to tell our kids how HennyGod, Waiters island, Javale Mcgee, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul  and our accountant won a championship led by LeBron James. Can’t name any other superstar who’s played with a more meme-potential team"
&gt; I've been concerned about the China issue since LeBron James made his infamous comments about Darryl Morey over a year ago.  Huh weird that you apparently never cared at all until that specific moment
"Not a troll. I've been a member of this community for over five years. I've been concerned about the China issue since LeBron James made his infamous comments about Darryl Morey over a year ago. You're right, I'm not for the riots or the looting or the violence. I think it's incredibly harmful to America and divisive and I think it pollutes the message that the protestors are trying to get across. That does not mean that I don't think that police brutality isn't a problem. I just don't think that defund the police is the answer. And that really more training and more funding would do a lot more so that police can be better at using deescalation  and other non violent ways of solving problems."
LeBron James is the new Aaron Burr
Not a troll. I've been a part of this community for over 5 years. I was a massive LeBron James fan until  his comments about China last summer which I just couldn't support. I've been upset about the NBA and their stance on China for at least a year now.

James Harden will wear LeBron on his jersey
You seem to underestimate how serious the HK issue was and is especially in light of the last two weeks. All the freedoms that HK was supposed to have for nearly 30 more years just evaporated.  Millions of families no longer have freedom of speech. Millions of those from HK are now stuck either living in HK with few freedoms or trying to move elsewhere and sell their property in a terrible market.   The fact that lebrons comment was that money was not educated on the issue showed just how idiotic the man is and how he morally doesn’t stand for anything that’s not already trending and acceptable.   LeBron James will likely never visit HK again because he’d be booed anywhere he went
"Lebron had to [issue an apology](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/12/24/lebron-james-apologizes-jewish-money-instagram-post/) one time for quoting a 21 Savage line about [""Jewish money""](https://imagez.tmz.com/image/10/1by1/2018/12/24/1044973b6901564fbb545d8dd9677015_xl.jpg)  Guess he didn't learn much from that situation."
"I see it this way. The NBA should denounce China for all its human rights violations. Hawley, as a sitting senator, should also not use it as a deflection point from a massive civil rights movement taking place in a country of which he is a citizen and an elected official. This movement affects much more of the NBA and Hawley’s own constituents than China’s situation. Players are speaking up because, as American citizens, they can have an effect on policy and civil rights. However, Lebron James can only do so much to influence China’s decisions while Hawley can actually introduce legislation to address Hong Kong and China if he wanted to. His letter was nothing more than an attempt to delegitimize the BLM movement and the civil rights concerns of the majority Black NBA players."
"That’s because you’re living a regular life. When you’re elite level, like a Lebron James, you don’t just think about your kids. You’re thinking about your entire future generations."
LeBron James is a commie.
Lebron James cares about one issue and one issue alone.
"But you see, the biggest injustice is anything that could take away money from LeBron James."
So what LeBron is supposed to offer up his opinion every time an athlete in any sport says something stupid? Who gives a fuck what LeBron James thinks? He's not the fucking pope of professional sports. I swear some of you take these guys way too seriously.
"Once again, fuck LeBron James. He had a chance to value human lives, more than his wallet. He chose his cashroll and even went as far to ask the league to fire Morey for tweeting #StandwithHongKong.  Can someone explain what Hawley said to the NBA because interjecting that the NBA should change its relationship with China is a weird position for him to take? I thought Woj was complaining about Hawley trying to get patriotic emblems on the uniform and I thought ""FUCK YOU"" was the appropriate response. Trying to diminish social justice efforts by adding empty platitudes is just pandering to your base. (I don't see Hawley railing against Trump for Putin's bounties on US service members or standing up get the Covid-19 problem addressed in the military.)"
What's that have to do with Lebron James?
I’m just glad China is letting Lebron James speak out on social issues again.
"What has he said about Jackson though? The relative lack of condemnation of Jackson for quoting Hitler from a league that a month ago skewered Brees for defending the flag is deafening. ‌   People see athletes picking and choosing their causes, some only when it’s convenient. It’s one of the biggest criticisms of LeBron James. He stands up for justice at home – admirable – but criticizes Houston's Daryl Morey for doing so abroad. ‌ It’s not consistent, and while this sort of inconsistency is certainly not limited to athletes, it muffles voices like LeBron’s from resonating as far as they could. ‌ In other words, if you're going to speak up, be consistent. If you're not, don't be surprised when some people tune you out.  I couldn’t give a fuck about anything these athletes say"

"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/24/lebron-james-jewish-money-comments-nba-asmr-21-savage  No matter what he’d say, we already know his true feelings on the matter."
"Yes, I (and most people) know China has detained our people before, but there's a distinct difference between them detaining a couple of low-profile teachers and detaining the *biggest athlete in the world* on a good faith, routine business meeting (exhibition game) if he were to not condemn Morey.  Detaining LeBron and the rest of the NBA players down in China, in *this* context, would be taken as a clear act of aggression as the US would not sit idly by while China tortures LeBron James."
"In response to ""fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,"" Lebron said, ""I think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could tweet or could say (could affect people),” James said. “We all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others, and you’re only thinking about yourself. “I don’t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.""   Anyone that defends the CCP gives no fucks about human rights. They execute those who criticize the government. Why do you hate human rights?"
Imagine being a 30 year old man getting mad online about the honor of Lebron James lol
"I did.  The user asked who has a better body for Basketball and I chose Giannis.  You mean to tell me you wouldn't pick a 7 ft, explosive player who can get to the rim, while having ridiculous length that makes it difficult to guard?   That's a cheat code!   Lebron james is a freak, but he doesn't have that FREAKISH body like Giannis."
Imagine comparing a Reddit user to Lebron James.
"Yeah, the **financial** ramifications. Not the best [source](https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/lebron-james-daryl-morey-punished-tweet/519049) nor the original one that I read but it will do. Not to mention that's not the point **at all**. If LeBron was really worried about his safety at that point in time because Morey put out a morally just tweet, than LeBron's anger should be directed at the CCP and not Morey. Why do you disagree?"
"Also Lebron:  ""I don't want to get into a [verbal] feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke,"" James said before the Los Angeles Lakers played the Golden State Warriors in a preseason game at Staples Center. ""And so many people could have been harmed not only financially, physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and say and we do, even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too."""
“Freedom of speech can have negative consequences” -Lebron James   I guess Woj agrees now.
"LeBron James moves product.  It’s about moving Nike products and keeping him away from UA, Adidas, etc"

"“If we have a single player test positive, whether an All-Star or a journeyman, that player would go into quarantine,” Silver said. Then medical personnel would track others with whom that player had contact.  As far as stopping a playoff series for a single positive -- whether LeBron James or a deep reserve -- Silver said the league would “treat that positive test as we would an injury.”  https://www.nba.com/article/2020/06/26/adam-silver-outlines-safe-and-responsible-plan-nba-comeback"
LeBron James versus the Warriors in the NBA Finals of course.  Everybody is still reviewing JR Smith's monumental mistake at the end of the game that could have changed everything.

Only reason LeBron is being a considered at all this year is because he is LeBron James and he plays for the Lakers.
Lu fucking Dort got a message in Haitian Creole added to the list. Apparent Dort has more pull in the league than LeBron James
LeBron is wearing a jersey with a cause on the back. The cause is LeBron James.
"Lebron is of course repping for the legendary Etta James while Dwight is wearing ""Howard"" in honor of Ron Howard who he thinks is black and dead."
Lebron James 51/8/7 against GSW has to be the absolute most heart breaking one for the way that it ended. He knew there was no way they could beat GSW in OT and had they stolen game 1 you never know how it could’ve changed the course of those finals.
"They are related if we’re saying that everything LeBron James has done in his life has only been to help himself, which is the claim that was made and the one that you said was 100% right. Everything he’s ever done is related to that claim, so you can’t just write off the good unless you want to die on the hill that he only did it for PR.  You keep trying to tell me that he’s got shitty views on China despite that having already been acknowledged."
LeBron “LeBron James” James
"Maybe you’re not comprehending...Unless I’m talking to Lebron James reddit account, you or I do not know."
Lebron locked Rose down 2011 ECF:   [https://theundefeated.com/features/rememberwhensday-lebron-james-puts-derrick-rose-in-the-torture-chamber/](https://theundefeated.com/features/rememberwhensday-lebron-james-puts-derrick-rose-in-the-torture-chamber/)  [https://nba.nbcsports.com/2011/05/27/who-is-mvp-lebron-shut-down-rose-during-series/](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2011/05/27/who-is-mvp-lebron-shut-down-rose-during-series/)
Lebron only cares about the struggle of James-folk
Using that logic Lebron James shouldn't have said anything about Drew Brees.
"Copy-pasting from an above comment:  &gt; Wilt's team had a win-loss record of 13-12 after this game, while the opposing finished the game with a record of 21-7. The opposing team had 6 current/future all-stars, including a young Elgin Baylor (63 points) and Jerry West (32 points) while Wilt's team, including Wilt, had only 3 all-stars.  &gt; In my view, neither Michael Jordan, nor LeBron James, nor Kareem, nor Larry- if placed on a team with no other major names and only 2 other present/future all-stars- are likely to beat a team with Elgin Baylor dropping 63, Jerry West tossing in 32, while backed up by Frank Selvy, Rudy LaRusso, Ray Felix and Hot Rod Hundley."

I'm saying caring varying levels for different social issues is not hypocrisy and claiming it is only helps those fighting against social change.   Lebron James saying something dumb about Hong Kong doesn't negate his efforts to support the BLM movement.   The NBA not saying much about Stephen Jackson saying stupid anti-semitic stuff isn't hypocritical and doesn't negate their support for the BLM movement.
"Political views? Why are you so angry and why are you cursing at me for speaking the truth? What ?  I’m talking about LeBron James’ hypocrisy, which is will documented. I have evidence as to why whatever he says should be taken with a grain of salt, because he’s always out only for himself and his brand.  So yeah. Not sure where all that hostility came from. I hope you’re having a better morning. Don’t let the CCP get to you TOO much. Just post a little here and there praising China and discrediting the U.S., it’ll be fine. They’ll still pay you and you’ll still have a job."
"&gt; If LeBron was having Giannis season, it would be unanimous and some might call it the best season ever.      Definitely agree with you on that call, I reckon the same can even be said for Harden last year. Reputation plays a massive impact in these MVP races.        If it was James who averaged 36/7/8 I don't think anyone would've hesitated to give him the award. A 32 game streak of at least 30 points and nine 50 point games too!"
"&gt;I’d take Jokic above AD.  It depends on how your team is built. In the Lakers case, they'd take Anthony Davis 10 times out of 10 since he meshes great with LeBron James, while being a versatile defender and a DPOY candidate, which Nikola Jokic lacks unfortunately. Players like Giannis Antetokounmpo would take advantage of Nikola Jokic in the playoffs. At least with Anthony Davis, my team has a fighting chance defensively lol  For what it's worth, Anthony Davis has had the better part of Nikola Jokic this season as well lol  I find it funny that there's way more people in general taking Nikola Jokic over Anthony Davis these days compared to last year before Anthony Davis was traded to the Lakers though lol"
"Well, one thing I always find is that paraphrases can often be a poor reflection of the actual words someone says. How often have we seen a reporter tweet something about a player, and have the player in question directly refute this point? The whole Kyrie wanting to start another league thing is a perfect recent example of that.  Also, I think the emphasis here is more on ""he knew that if a player caused the same type of uproar with something he said or tweeted, the player wouldn't be able to skate on it."". That, along with the subsequent part of the article (which I quote below), makes me think that LeBron was coming from a perspective of protecting the players rather than actually wanting to punish Morey.   &gt;But James wasn't finished. Morey wasn't there to answer questions, he countered. Silver hadn't spoken to the media in China, either. Why would this fall on the players to address?   &gt;   &gt;James told the room that it was too much for the players to take on in that moment -- to explain a complicated issue with racial, socioeconomic and geopolitical layers while visitors in China. It was time to follow the league's lead.   &gt;   &gt;James told the room that he wanted both teams in total agreement on how they would approach the rest of the trip. His instinct was to shield his colleagues from a nearly impossible public relations chasm.   &gt;   &gt;""It's always a responsibility with me as far as players, a protection for the players,"" James said Monday. ""That's always \[on my mind\]. I never speak for just me, things that just benefit me. I try to be educated as much as I can and speak from a pure heart of how can I protect not only me, but protect the players as well in that situation."""
"Nothing worse than unrequited love &amp; trade deficits. China’s Foreign Officers Geng Shuang, Zhao Lijian &amp; LeBron James really should be backing Woj."
"If Lebron was restricted from being Lebron James, then I guess Kawhi."
"Even though he would only play SF once he get the balls he still has the ability to create plays, i think that and his athletism in his prime make him better than kawhi. Even though you say ""only SF"" he still Lebron James, he wont like take something out of his kit."
"This is like asking who would be better in a catch-and-shoot role, Kyle Korver or LeBron James.  It's pointless. You wouldn't pay LeBron $40m to stand in the corner and not initiate an offense. Nor has he tailored his game over 35 years to play that role."
"I think it's important to first recognize that the concept of positional basketball is somewhat outdated.  Not every team has their ""point guard"" bring up the ball on every possession, because players have evolved and guys like LeBron James exist who have the combination of PG-like ball handling, passing, and vision, combined with explosive athleticism and a ridiculously large body. This has led to modern basketball being largely based around heliocentric plays, meaning there is one primary ball handler who creates opportunity by initiating an offensive set, attracting defenders, then capitalizing on whatever mistakes the defence makes; that means they either score themselves or pass the ball. LeBron, Giannis, Harden, and Luka are all examples of this play-style at its best. Trae Young, Damian Lillard, and (to some extent) Steph Curry are examples of actual point guards who also fit this heliocentric play-style archetype.  If your question is intended to ask ""who is better at things that a traditional Small Forward would do?"", then it's a completely different discussion that I don't know that I have the answer to, but LeBron is markedly better than Kawhi precisely *because* of all the things that he can do that are not typical for a SF."
LEBRON JAMES WITH THE REJECTION
"Dude wants to make you think calling a spade a spade is mean or some false narrative. It's a dick move to steal an artists work, whether they're a big time creator or a small time independent. Especially true when the one stealing is someone like Lebron James who could've spent just as much time searching for the creator as you did or pay someone to do so."
Absolutely no way they are killing Lebron James over a fucking tweet. What does China gain from kidnapping one of the most famous athletes in the world? That’s not only extremely unrealistic but also extremely stupid.
the fact that it is news Lebron James has his last name on the back of his jersey is a testemate to how weird 2020 is
"I guess it depends on how you feel like defining a small forward. LeBron James counts as one, but Paul George doesn't? Is Harden a small forward who happens to run point for his current team? Giannis Antetokounmpo? Tatum is a beast, IMO.  DeRozan is good, but the game just isn't played like his game is set up anymore. He can drive to the hole but is a little undersized and never developed a consistent three. Hell, I'd rather have Bojan Bogdanovic at this point."
"Lebron James, Lakers:  ""Consider Consuquences People!"" or ""CCP"" if it cannot fit"
"Because detaining lebron James would be an international incident that they don’t need, want, or could handle. If Lebron was so concerned about getting detained in a country, simply because some no name back office guy tweeted something negative about that country, then he shouldn’t have been there and he should never go back. This wasn’t a safety issue for him, this was a money issue."
"Sort of. Didn't explicitly ask Silver to discipline Morey, but certainly implies it if you take at face value a paraphrased account. [You can read for yourself what happened](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27852687/inside-lebron-james-adam-silver-make-break-moments-china), but the most relevant part is the following:  &gt;His question was related to Morey -- and the commissioner's handling of the Rockets' GM. James, to paraphrase, told Silver that he knew that if a player caused the same type of uproar with something he said or tweeted, the player wouldn't be able to skate on it. There would be some type of repercussion. So, James wanted to know, what was Silver going to do about it in Morey's case?  &gt;Silver pushed back, reminding the players that the league never doled out discipline when they publicly criticized President Donald Trump. Morey was exercising the same liberty when he challenged China. Regardless of the financial fallout of one versus the other, that's not what should matter. Silver might have disliked the ramifications of Morey's tweet, but he would defend the right to say it."
"...  More reteweeted an image that was supporting Democracy in Hong Kong.   LeBron responded saying:  &gt; “I think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could tweet or could say (could affect people),” James said. “We all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others, and you’re only thinking about yourself.  &gt; “I don’t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.”  And then followed that up with:  &gt; My team and this league just went through a difficult week.  I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others.  And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen.  Could have waited a week to send it.  It’s pretty obvious James is in the wrong across the board here."
Imagine a team consisting of:  Chris Paul  Michael Jordan  LeBron James  Tim Duncan  Hakeem Olajuwon     Would be a heck of a balanced squad.
"&gt;Simply detaining him or some lesser player would have been something they could have done.  Something they could have done that would've escalated tensions among top superpowers to the highest they've been in decades.   Do you honestly think that the US would just sit back &amp; not take respond if they detained any notable US citizen, let alone LeBron Fucking James, who was there on business terms?  Naw, China could hold the biggest athlete in the world hostage, torture him and the US would've just bent over."
"Let me catch you to speed on the landscape: - OKC had 3 pre-MVP winners on one team - Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden. - Kevin Durant left OKC to go to the Warriors, the year after the broke the bulls regular season record, with 70 wins. - the Warriors have the two best shooters of all time still: Steph Curry and Klay Thompson - Lebron couldn't quite win a championship with Cleveland. He then went to Miami (look up ""the decision"") and won 2 of 4 years with dwade. - Lebron went back to Cleveland and carried his team on his back to the finals every year, even after Kyrie left (there was a great SNL sketch at the about the other Caviliers). But they still won 1 with Kyrie. - Kyrie is uncle Drew - Kyrie and Kevin Durant are now with the nets, validating the other New York team, and they are known as the whiniesy players in the NBA. - the Knicks owner is a joke. - the Toronto Raptors traded a star player (sorta) for one year with Kawaii Leonard, and they won last year. - Kawaii and Paul George are now on a super team LA Clippers. - LA now has two super teams, now the Lakers have Lebron and Anthony Davis - the last two years have been the greatest draft years ever - two years ago Luka and Trae Young were drafted 6 &amp; 7 and model their games to be the next Lebron and Steph - this year we got Zion and Ja Morant. Zion needs no introduction, but Ja Morant was an awesome surprise who is athletic, drops dime passes, and has Russell Westbrook energy - Portland Trailblazers have Damian Lillard and CJ, who are great, but will never ever make the finals it seems - the Greek Freek is Giannis, and he IS the bucks (they have good role players) - San Antonio dynasty is over - Boston and Miami have great young teams that will be great if kept together - Philly could be great... But see Portland - DC sucks but John Wall has been out two years and Bradley Beal turned into Allen Iverson suddenly - Houston Rockets didn't work with James Harden and Chris Paul. People thought Paul was washed up and he went to OKC (after Russ and PG left) and they've been winning a bunch, reminding us he's one of the best point guards ever - now Rockets have Harden and Westbrook, which was awkward at first cuz they made Russ shoot 3s, and he can't... Then they got rid of their center to open the floor (small ball 2.0) and they clicked. - the rockets coach, Mike Diantoni will likely get fired if they yet again don't win/make finals, for his unconventional ways, but it's statically the best offensive style. - Denver Nuggets have an amazing center who stays far for no reason  Did I miss anything?"
[BREAKING] Skip Bayless HEATED reacts to Lebron James jersey decision
"They wouldn't have to murder Lebron James to make a point, if they were as monstrous and psychopathic as people on here claim. Simply detaining him or some lesser player would have been something they could have done.  Also the whole point of this exercise is to point out that Lebron *wasn't* wrong in why he was like ""wtf comments are those Morey""."
"&gt;You should tell that to the numerous people on Reddit who think the CCP are the greatest monster in the world.  I mean, they pretty much are, but they're not stupid.   Murdering LeBron James and the rest of the NBA players over for a simple exhibition game if LeBron *didn't* denounce Morey would be **very bad optics.**"
"Lebron James, famously, is an NBA player. He works full-time for a for-profit organization that does a significant amount of business with China. He’s only an “activist” on the side, to the extent you can even call him one.   If you think doing business with China is such a problem, you should probably boycott the NBA. Otherwise you’re complicit.   More to the point- if “silence is violence”, why on earth would you criticize someone for breaking their silence? That’s exactly what you claim to want them to do..."
"If the CCP kills LeBron James, of all people, that’s going to direct attention from multiple countries in the world. That’s the precise opposite of what China wants right now. China doesn’t need the NBA, the NBA needs China."
"Eventually I want a 30 for 30: Pandemic at Disney episode.  Brook Lopez beating up Goofy, James Harden trying sweet talk Minnie into the Jacuzzi while Mickey watches, Lebron hanging out with only Mulan and no one else, Embiid stealing a costume and walking around with a Captain Hook head"
it's not just the internet when you're lebron james and you have the ability to propel someone to a livable income by just mentioning them in an instagram post.
Lebron James is the newest member of The Eagles actually
"&gt; A number of the NBA's biggest stars have already chosen a social justice-related message that will be displayed on the back of their jerseys at the start of the NBA's restart this July. Yahoo Sports' Chris Haynes reported Tuesday evening a sample of some of the player selections. Additional jersey alterations were announced on Wednesday. NBPA president and Thunder guard Chris Paul will replace the name on his jersey with ""Equality,"" per The Undefeated's Marc Spears.    * Rudy Gobert, Jazz: ""Equality""  * Damian Lillard, Trail Blazers: ""How Many More?""  * Enes Kanter, Celtics: ""Freedom""  * CJ McCollum, Trail Blazers: ""Education Reform""  * LeBron James, Lakers: ""Consider the Consequences"""
https://sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/report-lebron-james-pressed-adam-000504291.html  He didn’t. But Lebron wanted him to be. And asked Silver to do it.
"Here this is what a mad person would say:  Why the fuck is he putting James or Lebron on the back of his jersey? This is disgusting. He could be sending a message. So irresponsible, just like he’s been all season on social affairs. Explain to me, why the fuck for god’s sake, is he not using Raymone on the back of his jersey?  That’s his middle name and by intentionally not using it, he appears to be embarrassed of it. Does he have something against the Raymones of the world? Is he ashamed of it? Absolutely heartbreaking! Michael Jeffrey Jordan would never dishonor his middle name like this. He didn’t put it on his jersey, no, he was even greater than that. Michael names his first born Jeffrey!  Disastrous and disappointing of LeBron"
LeBron “Sweatshop” James  LeBron “Uninformed” James  So many options
"I would tend to agree if you didn't use the word ""trajectory"". There is a player on that trajectory and there is hardly an argument against that. Giannis is likely a 2-time MVP at the age of 25. Lebron won his first chip age 27, Jordan age 28, both won MVPs before that. Also, what are Zion's and Luka's ""trajectories""? Do I believe, that it is likely any of those 3 will ultimately beat out someone like Shaq for a top 10 all time spot? No, but Zion's first 19 games are better than Lebron's were, Luka's first 2 seasons are pretty much of equal quality to James' and Giannis is at age 25 very much at the same Level as James was this age."
Money matters more than black lives for LeBron James as it seems..
"Lmao.  &gt; “I don’t want to get into a [verbal] feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke,” James told reporters.  What exactly was Daryl Morey uneducated about? Please let me know. If Lebron was saying that Morey should not have spoken up because it would hurt the NBA's bottom line in China, I could understand that. But nope, that's not what he said.  Morey tweeted:  &gt; Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.  Please, let me know what Morey 'wasn't educated on the situation at hand', in Lebron's words.  And how fucking gullible are you that you think Daryl Morey deleted his tweet because he was 'ignorant'. Daryl Morey deleted his tweet because he was told to by the NBA and his team owner. If you really think Daryl Morey deleted his tweet because he no longer believes his tweet, I have a bridge to sell you."
"&gt; The dude isn't a public figure, James is  What does that have to do with what I said?      I said this dude just pretending to care about Hong Kong only after lebron spoke so he can pretend to be outraged   That’s fake as fuck, and he doesn’t care at all about justice for Hong Kong. Just pretending to be mad to talk shit about bron  Theres plenty of people like that on reddit."
Let me lay it out for you bigot. BLM is racist one of the faces of the movement is racist and instead of coming out against it they were silent. LeBron James is racist when it comes to black issues he always fights but when it comes to others he has actually told people to be quiet because it effects his money. He will tweet at other players in other sports to stand with his issues but he is quiet when his own race is racist. As you have scoured my reddit you know that I was apart of several liberating forces that brought freedom and ended oppression for people so I am not against it at all. I dedicated my life to it. The difference between me and you is a lot of things but one thing is no matter who it is if it’s wrong I will say it is wrong. You take a bad position and support it. You hold no one accountable and you have done nothing to bring about meaningful change.
"Or he wanted the League to push this ruling, so James doesn’t take any blame since the NBA/LeBron are aware of their hypocritical stance on social change when they are literally pandering to what China wants."
"He dosent have to come up in EVERY damn thread. It's turning into Dave Chappelle ja rule meme at this point.   ""someone get LeBron James on the phone please"""
Save a click: LeBron James is going to put something on the back of his jersey.   Also... Who cares?
"Remember that LeBron James is a shill and advocate for a brutal and genocidal authoritarian regime in China that is largely based in an extremely racist ideology of Han nationalism. Minority groups are tortured, sterilized, and murdered in death camps!"
Lebron is mvp. Legoat James 5 more rangzzzzzzzzz
"You know what, let me take another approach.  For the NBA to rig something, they have to benefit from it.  Knicks winning the Ewing lottery?  Okay, there is a benefit to the NBA to have Ewing on the Knicks.  Lakers beating Kings?  Okay, also a benefit because Lakers are better for ratings.  General consensus is Portland is the biggest threat to LA.  LA is LA and they have Lebron fucking James.  LA losing in round 1 would be awful for the NBA.  Why would the NBA rig games to give LA the best chance to lose?  The best outcome for the NBA is a crippled Memphis team makes it and LA moves on easily.  Your conspiracy theory has no basis in reality.  Letting a team into the playoffs with the best chance to knock out the NBA team that brings in the highest ratings is stupid."
Nah i gotta respectfully disagree with you there mate. Kawhi was amazing that year but had clear playmaking deficiencies and a system/teamates that had immensely more help than James Harden or Westbrook.   Kawhi played elite basketball but he was 3rd or 4th in that MVP race depending on where you'd rank Lebron.
It’s all fun and games until you meet Lebron fucking James.
&gt;Bonus question: What if I swapped Lillard with James Harden?  Could you swap them both for rookie Lebron?
"I mean, he is relevant.   LeBron James makes baskets to keep himself relevant, you don't have to keep repeating it every time he does it though."
you think lillard will have a better series than lebron james
"&gt;Lakers are fucked if they're playing the Blazers in the first lol  What? Please tell me that you're joking. The Portland Trail Blazers play absolutely no defense unlike the Lakers, and need Damian Lillard to score 50+ points in some games just to barely get a win in the Orlando bubble. The Trail Blazers don't have an answer for LeBron James and Anthony Davis as well lol"
"And nobody’s gonna be like “ahh LeBron James likes that candidate, lemme go vote for them”😂"
Lebron James
"I don't think the Fox News anchors are all serious either, doesn't make their whole organization less disgusting.  Skip Bayless owes every bit of success of he's had  and money he's made since 2003 to the existence of LeBron James. ESPN literally created the hype machine around LeBron and then profited for more than a decade off of creating an ""anti-lebron"" character. It's disgusting. I also hate the ""'people watch"" defense of his rhetoric, preying on the public's tendency to gravitate toward sensationalism is unethical. He's scum. The people that employ him are scum."
"Chuck on jobs: "", I'll tell you, there's five real jobs in the world: teacher, fireman, policeman, doctor, and somebody who's in the armed services. Those are five real jobs. I dribbled a basketball my entire life, and now I get paid to watch LeBron James and Kevin Durant play.""  I love the ""five real jobs"" thing. Reminiscent of Michael Scott: ""There are four kinds of business: tourism, food service, railroads, and sales. And hospitals/manufacturing. And air travel."""
"The Lakers are definitely a lock for the wcf. They've never not been a lock for the wcf since AD got there. If Lebron James and Anthony Davis don't make it to the conference finals, ill eat my own ass with a rusty spoon, hold me to it."
"LeBron James faked a hate crime in 2016 or 2017. Look it up. I mean, you can't really look it up, because there's no proof it ever happened besides from him saying it did, but still."
Remember when LeBron James came to the defense of China saying that the players that criticized China didn't really understand what they were talking about? The players that were talking about China were smart LeBron James is not
lol give me a break. you don't know anything about me. to think lebron james of all people has it harder than an average person is ridiculous.
How is he talking like he's Lebron James?   And Dame is clutch. How is that a joke?
"Not shut up but he is talking like he is LeBron James, he has literally done nothing special in this league. Great player don’t get me wrong but he says that he is one of the most clutch players in this decade, what a joke."
"In the era of Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry and James Harden- not alot of mvps and chips going around. Y'all want Lillard to do what, sit down and shut up like he's a bum entitled to no opinion? Stop it."
Couple things   &gt;Butler he was not a superstar   Really that's what you're going with?   &gt;In the first year with Embiid and Simmons they beat the Heat in the first round in five games. I don't know what  What happened the next round? They lost in 5 to the Celtics led by a rookie Tatum and a sophmore Brown. Also included a game where Simmons scored 1 (1!) point and another where the team prematurely dropped confetti in a game they ended up losing.   &gt;Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum have won nothing by themselves except a playoff series.   2 playoff series and another where they took the Lebron James led Cavaliers to 7 games in the conference finals. Playoff highlights included beating aforementioned Sixers in 5 games the previous round and the birth of the he boomed meme   &gt; not have even made the playoffs. But they didn't have to because they had Kyrie Irving to help them  How did Kyrie lead them? They were actually much worse the following year under Kyries tutelage
Kyrie also played 0 minutes on the Celtics team that got to the Conference finals. That's why Jaylen and Jayson get the benefit of the doubt that Embiid and Simmons dont As a sophmore and rookie respectively they took Lebron James to 7 games. Best Embiid and Simmons have done is go to 7 in the 2nd round. And that's with Butler as well.
"NBA leaders and players said that Daryl Morey's comments were ignorant and that he didn't know what he was talking about!  Daryl Morey said that he believed the way protesters in China were being treated were wrong.  The protesters in China were victims of violence just for protesting.  Some of them were killed for simply protesting.  At the same times these NBA leaders and players are here in America defending protesters and condemning those causing violence against them.  People like LeBron James who advocate for people's free speech literally tried to shut a NBA GM for advocating free speech for a different country by calling it ignorant, then he turns around and says that his avocation of free speech is warranted.  That is why he is either ignorant, or willfully ignorant."
"You're right. The only player you could maybe argue was overpaid is Love, but that's about it. Everyone else was appropriately paid or a bargain. The economic part of team construction is something that many people miss. If team A is giving a max contract to Lebron James and team B is giving a max contract to John Wall, then team A has a massive advantage. There is a production/cost equation that the majority of championship teams maxed out. Like the Raptors with Siakam on a rookie contract or the Warriors with Draymond and Klay each making $15-17M/year."

What are you expecting from him? Lebron James performance?  He's a rookie. Missed a significant time. Lol.
"What an infantile, antiquated argument.  Damian IS one of the leaders in the NBA.  Also, Lillard doesn't speak as if he's LeBron James, that's a tangential, fallacious argument, something completely beside the point.  We've already established that rings enhance greatness, but greatness isn't defined by championships alone because there are far too many factors to account for.  Lillard has proven since he's been in the league that he's one of the most capable scorers in the league and he's become one of the best in that regard.  Absolute nonsense."
"I don’t know. They’ve looked awful. I think we’re just used to LeBron finding a way and therefore assume that he will. I don’t think the Suns beat them ..,but the Blazers could.  Edit: I’m so used to the Suns being bad that in the same way Im used to LeBron winning. I’m as equally used to the Suns losing. Both seem unfathomable (even though James missed the playoffs last year)"
Clearly is not “whataboutism” - I’m pointing out Trump’s blatant hypocrisy in disparaging the NBA for not stopping something that he himself is actively encouraging.   Addressing human rights abuse in China isn’t the job of LeBron James or the NBA - it’s the job of the US State Department and the US Gov as a whole. Focus on who is actually failing here.
“He speaks likes he’s LeBron”   What does this even mean lol. This dude is so full of shit   I guess any player who isn’t LeBron James needs to shut the fuck up and dribble
"2 weeks later, when LeBron plays poorly in a playoff game.  ""King James? He's no king. He should be looking at retirement homes for next year. WASHED!""   - Skeeup, probably."

"excerpt from an article that touched on this:  &gt; Let's say you trade Embiid for a smaller, faster team around Simmons. Philadelphia's fallback plan when possessions break down is now gone, as is their defensive anchor. For all the praise Simmons has earned on defense this season, it is still their center who drives their defensive success, propping up lineups with cast members big and small. The glare of every Simmons flaw is amplified by 100, and his inability to deliver as the game gets tighter in the playoffs now defines the team.  &gt; Let's say you trade Simmons for more shooting and ballhandling around Embiid. The Sixers are now even more reliant on a player whose availability is always in doubt. There's no counterpunch when teams bog the offense down in the halfcourt. The gap in defensive metrics can't account for Simmons' versatility and importance against the bigger wings — Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Jayson Tatum, and on down the line — who decide playoff series in today's NBA. Leonard was 2-for-11 while guarded by Simmons in last season's dramatic Game 7 loss to the Raptors. He shot 50 percent from the field on 28 more attempts against everybody else.

"How is it dumb? People heavily underrate how physical the center position is and how badly AD gets sonned by true centers.

He has his own signature shoe ... he’s in a lot of commercials... he gets credit for actually being a good rapper .. hes constantly going viral over social media ... idk this is a tough one for me ..idk what more he could do to cement superstar status .. but at the same time I don’t think my mom would know who he was if I showed her a pic... but she would know Anthony Davis lebron James harden curry even Kyrie
"Asked about Jayson Tatum dunking on him, LeBron James said he is ""very, very good and frankly, got me"""

"&gt;In 2011, the Chicago Bulls' front office got more votes than Pat Riley of the Miami Heat after he signed LeBron James, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade.  This is an odd example. The 2010-11 Bulls were an organically grown 62 win team. The Heat were great, but it was LeBron, Wade, and Bosh that decided to team up and pick Miami. I think creating the Bulls with awful ownership is more impressive than clearing cap space."

"&gt;I mean tbf in thisay d age it seems like 2 stars are not enough. But I trust LeBron and Ad  I disagree with you there. The Golden State Warriors and Miami Heat super teams were relative outliers when it comes to star power on a championship team compared to most other championship teams in NBA history. Those teams warped the view of what you need to win an NBA Championship. If you have 2 superstars, (superstars being a tier above stars, for example, Pascal Siakam is a star, but not a superstar yet), especially with the decent parity in the NBA right now, and some decent role players, which the Lakers do have, then that should be enough to win an NBA Championship. But yeah, I agree with you on the second point there, I trust in LeBron James and Anthony Davis as well lol 💯💯💯"
"&gt;[""LeBron James says Kyle Kuzma has to be the Lakers' third-best player if they want to win a championship.""](https://twitter.com/RadRivas/status/1293041270005235713)  Lol. The 3rd best player on a team doesn't equal the ""3rd star"". Key word: STAR. As in be the Chris Bosh or Klay Thompson ""3rd star"". Please read my comment again. I said that all Kyle Kuzma needs to do is be a star in his own role, since that's what he is right now, a role player. Kyle Kuzma hasn't even been the 3rd best player for most of this season, and the Lakers were just fine since other role players stepped up like Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Alex Caruso. All the Lakers role players need to do is chip in here and there offensively, and play some defense. LeBron James and Anthony Davis should take care of the rest if they play up to their standards lol"
"Luka is an anomaly. It's like if you took Lebron, and took away half his athleticism and you combine it with half of James Harden."

Lebron James was 30 seconds away from recording his fourth game ever with 0 rebounds.   He had two games with 0 rebounds in his rookie season and one in his first season with Miami.   Kind of surreal that he could play 38 minutes and only get one rebound and it was a free throw miss.
Kuzma shouldn’t ever be the definitive closer while LeBron James is a Laker
Seeing LeBron James on Western Conference made me see why people have been hating him all these years on the East. The guy also wears #23 while playing for the Lakers. LeBron is the basic bitch of the NBA.
"On Monday, Nuggest coach Mike Malone shipped crates of “Laker food” to the bubble court for a feast.Danny Green, Dion Waiters, Alex Caruso, Kyle Kuzma, LeBron James. AD from New Orleans. Malone said the BBQ chicken was so good that the Third String came over to be fed"
Lebron “dame lillard” James
"It's always ""the Lakers reaaaaaaally don't wanna see the Trail Blazers in the 1st round"" but never the other way around, like the Lakers don't have 2 superstars in LeBron James and Anthony Davis lol"
"Damn, LeBron James is out here writing children's books and MPJ wants you to not vaccinate your kids."
Kind of like MPJ is straight up abusing Lebron James. Since Lebron also isn't guarding MPJ.
"Jared Dudley: is fat and looks ugly, bonafide scrub for his entire career and yet talks like he’s some star player who has earned clout)  Dwayne Wade: Dirty ass player who gets away with being dirty and was never really a true mvp candidate, but people suck the shit from his ass because he benefitted from super team titles, and there was that shady business in 06 nba finals. False rings.  Lebron James: Perennially quits when the competition gets hard and instead forms super teams so he doesnt have to compete cause he’s scared of the grind. Psychologically delusional and has constructed his own alternative reality in which he lives because he’s so insecure about his legacy and public perception: “I never played for a super team.” False rings also.  James Harden: Entire game is predicated on being a soft bitch and baiting the referees. His best skill is flopping and traveling. Benefits from the sissification of contemporary basketball. Would not be nearly as successful a player as he is now in the 90s.  Chris Paul: little bitch who socks people in the balls, taddles, complains about everything, and takes everything up the ass. Has a little man complex. I wish Boogie would make him his girlfriend.  HM: Kendrick Perkins: Same reason was Dudley, but worse."
LEBRON JAMES THAT LAZER PASS
Lebron James?
"Paul George, Ben Simmons, LeBron, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Kendrick Nunn, James Harden, Gerald Green, Evan Turner, the Morris brothers, Kyle Lowry, Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, Rudy Gobert, AD, Jabari Parker, JR Smith, Grayson Allen and pretty much any other Duke guy, Rondo, Caruso, still fuck Dwyane Wade too."
"I don’t agree, a lot of people thought he would be a bust on this sub. He’s a sophomore putting up MVP numbers and the best rookie since Lebron James, that’s why he gets a lot of praise and attention"
Holy fuck that’s a massive lineup.  PG: 6’9 LeBron James  SG: 6’6 Danny Green  SF: 6’9 Kyle Kuzma  PF: 6’10 Anthony Davis  C: 7’0 JaVale McGee
Lebron James  Rudy Gobert   Joakim Noah
"Not in the big media studios like fox sports and espn. Then again, their topics are literally 80% dak prescott, tom brady and lebron james lol"
Lebron James shooting 88% at the line.
"Alright, I'll indulge you seeing how you don't seem to be trolling. Maybe you can elaborate on some of your more mind-boggling points.  &gt; Klay has some of the craziest scoring accolades.  Not nearly as crazy as Harden.  &gt;1 example. 37 point quarter. 0 misses. case in point.  Do you know what ""case in point"" means?  You think one single quarter of scoring illustrates the entire Klay/Harden debate?  You're using 12 minutes of basketball to compare two players?  Is Klay better than LeBron, Wilt, MJ, Kareem? None of them ever scored 37 points in a quarter.  &gt;Like Klay pops off, regardless if he doesn’t have every move Harden has.  Harden pops off much much more frequently.   Last year, Klay's season high was 38 points. Harden averaged 36.  &gt;He still puts the ball in the basket at a higher clip and efficiency.  No he does not. Your argument is based on stuff that's half baked and not even true.   In the last three seasons:  * Harden - 61.6%TS, 22.4 FGA * Thompson - 58.6%TS, 17.3 FGA  As you can see, Harden is the one that puts the ball in the basket at a higher clip and efficiency.   In the Playoffs, Harden is also more efficient on much higher volume.  In every single season that these two played, Harden was more efficient and shot more. Every single one. So you can forgive me for thinking you're trolling when you say stuff like that.     Klay has never had a single season in his entire career with over 60%TS. Harden is at 61.1% for his career.    &gt;AND his style of basketball lends itself to WINNING BASKETBALL, something James Harden doesn’t yet have.  Again, how can you say something like this and not expect people to think you're trolling?  Harden got to the WCF two times as the best player on the team. The Rockets have been contending for years with him as a leader.   In the last 5 years, he has won more Playoff series as the best player on the team than anyone except for LeBron, Curry/KD and Kawhi.  You're confusing the concept of winning with the concept of playing winning basketball. Klay is a great player, but he would get absolutely nowhere as the main guy.   &gt;Kobe even reminded us, Harden will never win a ring playing how he plays.  Maybe that's true, because Harden will always be the de facto superstar on any team he plays. It still has no relevance on the Klay comparison, because Klay isn't even in that conversation. He is an extremely good supporting player, but was a winning player because he plays for GSW.  But let's look at what Kobe actually said instead of taking quotes out of context.  The interview you're referring to took place when Chris Paul was coming from injury and Harden was basically playing a one man game during his absence. When he said ""i don't think that style is ever going to win championships"", he was talking about the Rockets sans Chris Paul.  Immediately after saying that, Kobe says - ""Now when you have Chris Paul coming back, and you have more movement, when you move guys around, when you're harder to find"". He follows it up with  saying ""What he's doing is absolutely remarkable though, and its a testament to how remarkable it is that people are now trying to minimize what he's doing. I mean he's doing some phenomenal stuff.""  &gt;So wtf does it matter if Harden has more moves if at the end of the day he doesn’t win shit?  It matters because it's not an individual sport. Every year a lot of players that are worse than a lot of other players win rings. Plenty of players better than Klay have failed to win the NBA Championship.  Is Klay better than Barkley, Malone, Stockton,   Klay is a great player, but Harden is an MVP caliber player. There's a huge difference between them. Thompson has never even made an All-NBA 2nd Team, and has recieved one MVP vote in his entire career.  Literally the one single thing that Klay has and Harden doesn't is rings. So the only way to have Klay as better than Harden is if you only count rings and nothing else. Which would make Horry better than Jordan etc.  Harden has more MVPs (1 to 0), more All-Star selections (8-5), more All-NBA 1st selections (5 to 0) and more overall All-NBA selections (6 to 2).  Klay has never even won Player of the Month.  Every single catch-all stat ranks Harden as the significantly better player.  I've already written way too much so I'm not going to go into playmaking which you seem to ignore in your comment.  Hopefully between the falsehoods and ridiculous leaps of logic in your comment I pointed out you can understand why I thought you were trolling."
"That's because people have spent so much time comparing Lebron to MJ, they don't notice that he's the modern day Larry Legend. James is a better scorer and Bird is a better rebounder, but they are both rare players who can play all aspects of the game at an elite level."
"Uh yeah. We have Lebron fucking James and Anthony fucking Davis on our squad   Understand that regular season =/= playoffs  If the Celtics somehow made the finals, the Lakers would beat them in an easy 5"
The NBA is sounding like a normal business.   Waiting for LeBron James to get scolded for ordering more than $45 of food.
There is no way Luka would ever be more popular than someone like Mahomes or any of the other top QBs in the NFL. Even if he became LeBron James great and his mother used a time machine and had him born and raised in New York.
"why mention Bird but not mention Rondo as the negative?  Edit: https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/6/15/21290999/top-5-nba-playmakers-lebron-james  Harden was #2 ahead of Luka at #3, article was from Jun. 15 2020"
"I feel like Luka is more of a LeBron James Harden type. LeBron like in the playmaking and team leading, but offensively very Harden like."
"On this sub specifically, many people claim he's already better than James Harden, and even some keep on mentioning how he will be GOAT over MJ.  Luka's a great player and has potential, but we should wait to see how he does in playoffs before we start comparing him to LeBron and MJ"
"The closest I can think of LeBron being anywhere involved with Skip Bayless’ name is that one rap song that KD and LeBron made during the lockout season, where KD’s verse goes:  &gt;	Every hater all the same, I feelin’ like the world is Skip Bayless and I’m LeBron James.  But KD is the one saying that."
"LeBron, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russel Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis are all more famous in America than Luka or Giannis."
"1. Steph misses a lot of games the last few seasons. 2. Damian Lillard has on several occasions publicly demonstrated respect for LeBron James, the r/nba darling, while Steph is on the squad that said LeBron was ""in his feelings"" and prematurely celebrated victory before losing a 3-1 series. 3. Guys who are less serious and more ""jokesters"" tend to get the ire of this sub (Dwight, Embiid, Lance Stephenson, probably about 10 other examples). Steph is not quite on that level but he has a far less serious attitude than Dame. I'm not saying that's bad but for some reason those personalities get a little less love here."
"DNP-Minor Things  LeBron James, DNP-Minor Coasting Things  Lou Williams, DNP-Minor Wing Things  Karl Malone, DNP- ya know... nevermind..."
Is Luka not one of the most popular players in the league rn? I would think that this year he’s been more popular than anyone not named Lebron James or Zion. And the only reason we talk about Zion so much is because he was the most hyped up prospect in recent memory.
Because Patrick Mahomes and LeBron James exist
Crazy Jimmy Butler gets nearly twice the amount of free throws as LeBron James.

All of Canada and LeBron James
LeBron James Harden would tear up the league
"Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!” Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"There is a guy named Luka Doncic. He’s the best prospect since LeBron James. If anything, Emoni will be the best prospect since Luka."
"this says lebron was the youngest, but in amount of games he was 9th https://www.nba.com/milestone-baskets-lebron-james-career"
"Like brandon roy, lebron james or chris Paul?"
The real question is who is better MJ Warren or Lebron James.
"Bronny James. Already has national name recognition, would get massive media attention, a signature shoe line his rookie year, and it would be a natural transition as LeBron starts to age."
LeBron James I cannot stand ever. Never been a fan of his. Ready for him to retire. My prom with him is that he’s an egomaniac he thinks the world and the rest of his team Revolve around him
LeBron Harden and James James.
"No, I think it's hypocritical for people as a whole (it's not only black Americans who are associated with the league) to talk about human rights and racial justice while profiting off of slave labor and playing by the rules of what is essentially the modern equivalent of Nazi Germany while they speak out about slights, real and imagined, where it is safe and popular to do so.  I've participated in protests long before the media decided that it was popular to do so, as a Staten Island resident that was disgusted by what happened to Eric Garner. LeBron James doesn't give a shit about equality if the people who are suffering A) don't look like him or B) impact his financial bottom line."
"Crushed by the Lakers? I mean, I think most any team in the West has the potential to be crushed by any given team, but I'd say that about most any team that has LeBron James on it. That said, the Lakers aren't likely the Blazers first or even second weakness in the West, assuming every team is healthy. The Clippers, Jazz, and the Nuggets are arguably tougher match-ups, though you can definitely make the case that LeBron is the tougher match up by default. What I consider is that Nurkic, Collins, and Whiteside combined are a problematic rotation for the Lakers if you're playing against the 8 seed."
"Dame is going to drag this team into the playoffs.  Then, oh then, he will make Lebron James his girlfriend in the first round."
Right? Like why would they even worry about some guy named LeBron James when Mario Hezonja is on the team? /s
How do the Trail Blazers deal with LeBron James and Anthony Davis?
"I’m the biggest rockets homer but let’s not get carried away here. They have lebron james and Anthony Davis, they're definitely a worry and will be favored against us"
"Yes ur totally gonna be able to trap lebron James, one of the greatest players of all time with one of the best basketball IQs ever, for 7 straight games with Mario Hezonjia and Gary Trent Jr"
"It's common knowledge that the NBA wants Lakers vs. Bucks. It's what casual fans want, so it's what the NBA wants - period, full stop.  Just like the NBA practically crafted the play-in rules so that the Pelicans (and Zion) could get into the playoffs. Unfortunately, Zion came in and played like a potato, so that didn't work.  The NBA is in the business of entertainment. The Lakers are a big-market team with nationwide appeal, led by ""face of the league"" Lebron James - it would be highly beneficial to keep Lakers fans nation/worldwide engaged in the playoffs, because keeping them engaged means they watch the games, buy jerseys, buy merch, etc.  The league will do everything it can reasonably do to see the Lakers advance. Watch the officiating next game. Let's see how quickly they load Blazers players up with fouls, or how much they swallow their whistles if the Lakers get a head of steam and start putting up some points.   This series can go one of two ways: Lakers in 7, or Lakers in 5. Sucks for the Blazers, but the Lakers are too big to fail in the 1st round.  That being said, I hope that's a reverse jinx and the Blazers pull it off. I might hate them, but I love chaos."
"How about Lebron James adjusts his game to his roster for once in his career? The roster is set, learn to adapt. Maybe learn to play off-ball and actually practice and get a pull up J like the other greats.  What has made Kobe, Jordan, Durant and Duncan so good was their ability to adapt to their roster throughout their careers. Sometimes they’re slashers, sometimes they’re facilitators, sometimes they’re playing on-ball, sometimes they shadow and play off-ball.   Lebron’s game is incredibly 1-dimensional because he doesn’t have a lot of shot creation. You know exactly what he’s going to do. He’s going to drive and lay it in, or he’s going to kick. There’s no floater, no pull up J, no step-back J etc etc"
"...ok, well what else are you going to do then? Be Lebron James, sign AD, talk Kawhi into joining you, convince Dame to demand a trade to the Lakers, and kidnap James Harden?  ""These other bums"" are what you get when you force a team to bring in AD."
"In the most important games, you can actually expect LeBron to play all 48. Hell it was just two years ago where Old James was doing 45 just for his team to survive. That's what it takes sometimes to get to the finals and win some chips. You gotta be hungry and put your body on the line."
"&gt;Almost no one shoots these midrange shots anymore because it's just not worth it  Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Luka Doncic, James Harden, Chris Paul, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, Kyrie Irving, and pretty much any other efficient superstar in the NBA shoot the mid range regularly. Why do you think they're able to do that and still be some of the most efficient players in the game? They shoot more mid range than anyone else, why are they still efficient?  Because being able to hit the mid range means that teams have to hone in on that section of the floor.  Also, in the playoffs, the mid range is more valuable than ever. The paint defense gets much harder to get past, so being able to pull up from mid range makes a huge difference for guys like Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard. You know, guys who win NBA championships."
"Man. Love me some Barkley, more than any commentator out there tbh... but 17 years later and there still aint no respect on LeBron's name.  If there was one active player in the game you could and should be like ""Yeah even if my guy was down 3-0 I still feel the comeback can happen"" it's LeBron.  I mean.. down 3-1 agaisnt arguably one of the best teams of all time... in the playoffs... the finals... and that happened.   So why is it pre and now post game one people out here forgetting the magic James does with teams in pressure and important situations.  Ahh shit I dunno, that's my little rant. They don't respect the game until you're gone sometimes."

"Nailed it. If LeBron didn't collapse in that finals Flash would have four chips and two fmvps and it would be a little harder to relegate him as someone who ""needed"" Bron. Not discounting James either, he was lights out against Chicago that year."
Either Portland in 4 or Lakers in 7.  The longer the battle the less advantage for Portland.  Right now they’re are firing on all cylinders while Lakers have been rusty and generally not playing well in the bubble.   Think we will see some rigged ref calls in the coming few games.  Nike and NBA are not going to let Lebron James lose so easily and so early
"Because LeBron just passed up an open floater to throw it out to Caruso with the clock wondering down and the other teams best player guarding him.  That play was a horrible play by James, and he followed it with that early three point attempt. And after missing the free throws.  Yeah KCP and Green suck, McGee is trash, but Lebron and AD are supposed to be the superstars and they failed miserably with the game on the line. Kuz is more confident and aggressive than they are."
"they definitely won't retire it based on ""he's LeBron James""  it will take rings"
"Truth  First person I've seen not up the Lakers booty hole lol  I've gotten atleast -100 downvotes tonight for simply stating and having fun saying vintage Lebrick James was in full effect, same dude who lost in the finals for being a passive and scared offensive player.   Yet ALL the blame goes on AD and company, but I could have sworn LeBron James was the best player in the league and best player on the Lakers, but I guess I'm wrong. 23 points and his shooting performance was bad, yet he gets a pass for all the assists and rebounds. Lakers won't win until LeBron steps it up. No excuses."
"Ahhh 2012 where the Heat led by LeBron James faced off against the Thunder featuring James Harden, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook in the NBA Finals."
"It tells you that Lebron didn't play well. Prime Lebron would have put 50 on hid head. Put trent on KD and kawhi and they put 50 on him. How the hell fucking Lebron james let guards like Beverly and Trent play good Defense on him, i don't understand, he needs to punish them"
"He’s not a pussy on defense against star players. He clamped Lebron, and ik Lebron isn’t Harden scoring wise but it would help us a lot. He kept James Harden to 1-9 from 3 his first game. He’s been defending opponents #1s since he got into the starting lineup"
What? The media consensus has been Giannis wins MVP with Lebron coming in second. Harden is competing for a distant third with Luka and likely won't get a single first place vote. Just look at how crazy the betting odds are at -2400   **PlayerOdds**  Giannis Antetokounmpo-2400  LeBron James+1100  James Harden+8000  Luka Doncic+8000
"&gt;21/17/16...not bad for a 36 yr old, they'll likely win it in 6 and if it goes to 7, it's Bron all day  Triple doubles aren't the answer to everything.   Lebron's shooting was only TS 49.83%, significantly below his career averages and league average.  His assist numbers are solid, but nobody brings Lebron James to their team hoping he gets you assists and rebounds in the playoffs. He is literally supposed to be a one man offense, and that includes being able to score."
That's a terrible team how about...  Steve Nash  Michael Jordan  Lebron James  Tim Duncan  Shaq
Would be crazy to see Tom Brady and Lebron James both get bounced in the first round in the span of a few months
"&gt;When I posted it Lebron actually had a higher percentage and now they are basically tied  They were basically tied then and they are basically tied now. OR Lebron had a higher percentage then and Harden has a higher percentage now. You can't have it half one and half the other. Funny how you word things such that it seems to prove your dumbass arguments. Both before and after the last game, the difference in percentage was miniscule.  &gt;Second LeBron is the third best player of all time  You're talking about these things like they're factual? To you he might be the third best, to someone else he might be number one.   &gt;You are counting only Harden's games when he had nobody taking the ball out of his hands  Lebron has been the first option ever since he entered the league. Harden was a 3rd option for much of his career. Just because he is a late bloomer does not negate all what he's accomplished or the offensive skillset that he possesses right now. It's not like James Harden didn't play along superstars (like Westbrook and CP3) when he was a 1st option, just like Lebron James played with some great players.   &gt;On top of all that Lebron was a better defensive player  We were talking exclusively about offense and now you're switching.  This entire debate is meaningless anyway because you are taking the number of 30+ playoff games to decisively judge a player's offensive ability. Which is pretty stupid. I don't know why this stat means so much to you."
&gt;[NBA] LeBron James  Guy with this flair trying to say my life is sad lmao
"He didn't even deserve to go to the line. Also:  &gt; LeBron James missed 2 FTs with 12 secs left in OT and the Lakers up 1. In the final 15 seconds of the 4th qtr/OT, LeBron is 10-21 (48%) on FTs in one-score games since the start of 2017 season. That's the worst FT pct of any player with at least 10 FTA in those situations.  Back in 2009 playoffs refs tried very hard to make the LeBron vs Kobe finals happen and LeBron consequently averaged 15 FTA. If he were even a bit clutch and made a couple more FTs, he easily would have made the finals that year."
Your best player is LeBron fucking James yet you still lost to the 8th seed
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"37 is half of 74, I figured you wouldn't be an ass about me not giving exact percentages since 34 and 37 are close enough.   I was referencing to the other guy who compared lebron's percentage to harden's, apparently he got the numbers wrong. Either way, Lebron and Harden have the same percentage of 30+ games in playoffs since. Since we're being pedantic here though, you're wrong, Harden actually has a slightly higher percentage than Lebron does.   Again, this is all with James Harden being double or triple teamed at times. Lebron does not face that nearly as often as Harden does. You can't account for the opportunities that that creates for his teammates. It's asinine to argue against Harden's offensive abilities on the fact that he doesn't have as many 30+ playoff games as the best player of all time."
Hell Yeah! fuck that hypocritical literal bastard lebron james
"Don't ask me about my business - LeBron ""Michael Corleone"" James"
"He also wasn't playing a team with Lebron James and Anthony Davis, to be fair."
Only because KD and Steph aren't active right now.  I'd go:  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 1. LeBron James 1. Kawhi Leonard 1. Kevin Durant 1. James Harden 1. Stephen Curry 1. Anthony Davis
"pretty much happened to the bucks today too. Idk how much valid criticism could be placed on lebron today besides subpar FT shooting. Yes he had a mismatch against trent jr, but with 2 7 footers packing he paint hes not reliably getting to the rim even as lebron james."
I’ve heard this about literally ever LeBron team. I heard this *every single year* during his second stint with the Cavs   Has anybody considered the possibility that LeBron James makes his teammates worse?
**LeBron James is the first player to record a 20/15/15 statline while losing to the 8 seed in NBA playoff history.**
"They do. Every shooter that shoots with LeBron James gets worse. They take a back seat, the offense stagnates, they barely touch the ball unless they’re shooting and that’s why they get cold. It’s a fact no knows or don’t want to admit. It’s why teammates always seem to choke with ball dominant players.   Just look at Lebron on the heat where they actually ran offense that weren’t pumping lebron’s assist numbers. The Heat’s shooters shot well because they actually were allowed to touch the ball. It’s why championship teams never have 1 player with a lot of assists and the assists are spread out"
"LeBron James in a heroic effort , dropping a triple double on Portland , while his team still lost due to their ineptitude at shooting the ball.. Playoff Bron needs some Playoff minded teammates."
"You do whatever LeBron James tells you to do if he's on your team, regardless of how rational it is"
"All i saw was LeBron doing what he does best...choking like a bum. All that Social Justice bull shit got Karma on his ass like white on a paper plate. Lolol  Hope and pray the Blazers sweep, so MJ, Kobe and all the other greats that people neglect when crowning LeBron the undisputed GOAT...can rest easy, knowing LeBron rock that fake ass hair of his bc he too scared to go the way off Kobe and MJ.   Lebrick James and all his all star supporting cast, I assume he will opt out of his contract asap and try to join the Nuggets, or Bucks in order to catch up with the greats well ahead of him on the totem poll"
"""He only scored 30 or more in 50% of his playoff games with the Houston""  Your stupidity knows no bounds, imagine criticizing a player because in a sample of 74 games, he scores 30 or more in half of them.   If Harden was given the usage of Lebron back in OKC, he would have way 30+ point games. He has a significantly higher percentage of 30+ games in the playoffs with Houston than Lebron.   Not to mention, Harden often decides to take it a notch down because teams decide to double or even triple team him, in which case he defers the offense to someone else and simply makes assists.   Just because you triple teamed James Harden doesn't take away from his offensive abilities. He then opens up opportunities for his teammates."
"Lebron had a bad game, nothing else matters.   Dude has had nothing but diamond class supporting casts to rely on in order to win his 3 rings. Tonight was vintage Le-Brick James and no matter how many rebounds and assists he gets, being ""The best all around player of all time"" dude ain't never gonna carry a team for a chip. Period.   LeBron won't pass Kobe's greatness...Let alone MJ."
"Classic Le-Brick James!!! Lololol How many all stars/ex stars does this dude need to carry him?!?!  Dude needs to shave his fake ass hair, change his jersey number, and convince the movie makers to edit those whack ass Space Jam 2 jerseys ASAP. Dude ain't Jordan...never gonna be Jordan, even he knows it which is why he refuses to shave his head, bc he don't want to give in to the Jordan riding he been doing since high school.   Was hoping LeBron woulda been more motivated after the Last Dance doc...MJ made that shit to clown on Lebron for thinking he the goat, and all his butt buddys with the same mindset.   Dude is hot garbage."
That was terrible shot selection. How the fuck in your right mind are you going to take that knowing well and truly you have LeBron James and Anthony Davis on your team...
"AD basically just got all his points at the free throw line, he's doing his best James Harden impression, while doing absolutely not much else than getting the odd bucket from the fast break. The least aggressive Top 5 player in the league. LeBron solid performance. Danny Green selling the bag."

Our offense is awful. Our defense is awful. We are just a straight-up awful team. Everyone on this team not named LeBron James or Anthony Davis is a complete fucking embarassment.

LeBron James is just amazing...
Lebron James really is the man
Hello Lebron James. Nice to see you after 2 years.
SURPRISE SURPRISE YALL FORGET IM LEBRON JAMES
"Yeah that looks about right.  LeBron James, folks."
Lebron James woke up
Lebron James
watching the TNT feed -- just lebron james highlights during the break with some hype music.   nice marketing NBA
I never seen LeBron James look this underwhelming in a playoff quarter since the 2011 playoffs.
Lebron James and Anthony Davis
Lebron 'Jeff Green' James with a nice drive
Paging Lebron James
You said it yourself they were close games each time. You think Lebron James isn’t enough to be the difference in the game? Stop blaming it on the coach. The difference between you guys was they had one of the greatest players of all time playing ending the game. Your coach didn’t underachieve at all in that series.
"Sources: Lebron James has started production on a wrist cast for the duration of this playoffs Incase he loses, to use in the post game presser"
Jeff green is basically lebron james at this point
"Jeff ""Lebron James"" Green"
Jeff Green = LeBron James but good at 3 point shooting?
James harden beating Lebron and the Lakers would be something so pure and beautiful
Jeff Green or Lebron James?
I know I know it’s tiktok and stupid. But someone from TikTok claimed on August 18th Lebron James will score 60 against the Blazers. He said this before the bubble even started. Hes a time traveler obviously.
"Right now, you are most certainly right. However, two years ago I bought a Jayson Tatum RC graded 10 for $30 bucks and I'm selling it next week for $1000. Same deal for an Ingram RC and LeBron James RC. Except the LeBron card might get me $5,000."
Didn’t we see it last year when he “activated it” only to miss the playoffs?  [source](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2821693-lebron-james-says-playoff-intensity-activated-for-rest-of-lakers-season)

People don't pay hundreds of dollars to see ten year olds play ball. NBA is a product and throwing out the guy people paid good money to see over a referees hurt feelings is putting out bad product. Some of those people in the crowds may never have the opportunity to see Lebron James play in person ever again. Maybe their tickets were a gift. Maybe they scrimped and saved for the chance to see the game up close. Then Lebron gets kicked out because Kane Fitz is a weiner.
"People forgot his hawks team? I don’t give a shit if you’re going against Lebron James, a 60 win team DOES NOT GET SWEPT WITHOUT BAD COACHING"

"The BubbleTM in the NBA is a unique environment that'll be impossible to duplicate in a more traditional NBA arena. Once teams go back, new players who have shined in The BubbleTM may find themselves coming back to earth a bit. Obviously superstar players like Dame and young talents like Booker won't be a part of that category, as even if they get a little worse, they'll still be superstars in their own rights.  &amp;#x200B;  Anyway, here's my list of superstars for the future in no particular order:  * Kawhi Leonard * Lebron James * Giannis Antetokunmpo * James Harden * Anthony Davis * Luka Doncic * Kevin Durant * Kyrie Irving * Steph Curry * Damian Lillard * Joel Embiid"
"""Our economy's based on Lebron James"""
"So far Fultz scored more in these 2020 playoffs  than Lonzo Ball, Ben Simmons, Dame Lillard and Lebron James combined."
"imagine not being better than LeBron James/ to the G League with you, scrub"
The ole LeBron James treatment.
Is he supposed to start over LeBron James and Anthony Davis?
"&gt; Kane Fitzgerald is one of the most selfish referees in the game. He has such an inflated ego and constantly tries to make the game about himself.    Swap Kane Fitzgerald with LeBron James and referee with player, would also be a true statement."
I just had a flashback to when we beat the Lebron James Heat all the time in the regular season just to get eliminated by them in the playoffs like every year.
At least we win without having to bring in random stars like daddy Lebron James.
"Luka’s the only one to blame. He perfected the flop so well that even his own teammate came into to defend him, which resulted in the second tech. And this is the fault of all the flopping that has become so mainstream with superstars doing it like Lebron James and Dwayne Wade. Smh my head."
"The primary difference is LeBron didn’t play with a top 5 all-time NBA player for most of his career like Magic Johnson did.  That’s not to slight Magic - IMO he’s a top 10 all-time player - but it helps when you play with a still prime level Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the first half of your career.  I’ve long said LeBron James is a hybrid of Magic Johnson and Scottie Pippen, and better than either of them, though Johnson and Pippen were better at certain attributes (Magic was a little bit better passer and Pippen was a better defender than James)."

&gt; Getting by Melo or Trent a few times isn’t proof “lebron James is getting to the basket how he always has”.  &gt; Lebron didn’t get to the basket nearly enough considering it was Melo and Trent guarding him  27/10/10 on 71 TS%. I’d say he got to the basket plenty
LeBron James! With no regard for common decency!
Luckily AD has some guy named LeBron James to help him out.
well yeah.... he's lebron james
"It is a bit of a hyperbole, but Bron has the best argument for being number 1 in the game because he’s showed up year in &amp; year out like this and still looks like he’s coasting.  Kawhi is balling and has always been consistent in the playoffs recently, but his body of work isn’t anywhere near LeBron’s nor is his entire game as well rounded as his. Neither is Giannis’.   Credit to both of them, but if I’m taking one player to carry my team to the Finals, it’s *still* gonna be LeBron James."
"Few positives to take away from this series:   Portland  - Melo definitely belongs in the league. In fact his mid range jumper is one of the few consistent things that happened throughout the series.   - GTJ is a great 3 pt shooter. Every time he shoots the ball, i almost always feel like it’s gonna go in.   - CJ is playing with a fractured back. Looking at how he balled out at the last game of the series, and playing &gt;40mins. I hope he’s fine and nothing serious happens to him.  Lakers   - AD’s mid range is butter. Throughout the regular season, you can tell he always settles for his mid range jumper when he’s uncomfortable in a post-up scenario and he usually misses more than he makes. For some reason, it’s really good now.  - LeBron James can definitely turn it up in the playoffs. Here’s to my fellow lakers fans who doubted him after game 1.   - With Alex Caruso playing more minutes with Rondo out, he definitely lived up to expectations."
There are a lot of LeBron haters and James Harden haters and Westbrook haters and Lakers franchise haters
"Lots of people who hate the Lakers, LeBron, occasionally AD, the Rockets, James Harden, and occasionally Russell Westbrook"

Lebron James has now won 25 straight non-finals playoff series
imagine lebron james holding you like youre his girl in post-game handshakes.
"LeBron is not good at basketball. He is only good at passing, blocking shots, playing passing lanes, making his teammates better, finishing in traffic, scoring in the post, shooting threes and SUCKING DICK at basketball.   More like LeYawn James cause he’s also boring"
My dad asked if LeBron James owns the Lakers. Normal people don't know anything.
That State Farm commercial would be so funny if it was Kimbo Slice and LeBron James
"I mean, I'd love to see it... but because they're playing a rested LeBron James... with a team held together with bandaids and super glue"
Because it’s talking about LeBron James...Is this a serious question or am I being wooshed?
"**For $1,000,000: Who invented the cultural phenomenon known as “Taco Tuesday”?**  A) Mark Wahlberg  B) LeBron James  C) Glen Bell  D) That’s ridiculous, nobody can claim to have invented “Taco Tuesday”."
People keep bringing up the 2016 election but didn’t even bother reading the first paragraph.    “LeBron James helped form a group that will spend millions of dollars to battle voter disenfranchisement in predominantly Black communities ahead of the Nov. 3 election between the Republican Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.”  Doesn’t guarantee those communities will vote for Biden but is great to see people use their right to vote.
The lakers gonna come out like they got their asses beat with a belt in the parking lot behind a pissed off lebron james.
"I get sad over JR Smith hate. I really like him, seems like an alright guy and is (or at least was) a total baller. Lot of people seem to think only as a shooter but he has some of my all time favourite dunks and also used to be a solid defender. He wouldn't be back on a LeBron team if James didn't respect him"
LeBron “grey beard” James.   I got the same shit going too my dude. Ball out.
"See Game 1 2018 Finals, LeBron James draws a charge on KD that leaves that refs **bamboozled** on whether it was a charge or block lol. The ref from New York who always shows up to elaborate on calls, was stumbling and mumbling lol, he didn’t what know what in the world was going on."
Lebron James was on the cavs in 2016. The election was less than 5 months from when the Cavs won the title. Lebron James actively supported Hillary Clinton. He even campaigned for her during rallies. Donald Trump won Ohio by 8%. Lebron James is irrelevant when it comes to politics.
I really like James Harden 3pt shooting dude. what a thrill to watch. feels like he's missing something tho to put him in that LeBron Giannis echelon.
"Nepal does not have the clout and power of the United States.  As garbage as Trump is, China threatening an American as high profile as LeBron James would absolutely be met with consequences. Hell the whole reason our military is as overblown as it is, is so we have that big stick to stand up for shit like that.  China already knows that the US isn't going to give a shit about what China does to its own citizens. Isn't that the whole idea of privilege? Having privilege is not inherently bad, but the entire social justice movement is about engaging privileged allies to help address the disenfranchised.  That said, I absolutely expect the US and American athletes to have more of an active role in supporting domestic issues. They've done a fantastic job of that, and the china situation does not take away from it. However, the response of making Morey walk back his words along with LeBron's condemnation rather than support or neutrality, is disappointing. The NBA does not need to free Hong Kong but I'd at least expect them to stand by their employees in support of a social movement- even if it isn't an American one."
LeBron James.
These players beneath Lebron James should just line up and comply! Anybody who does not will be cancelled!
"Olshey has signed some terrible contracts though, and there aren't really many trades that have helped the Blazers either.   Olshey however ruined the Clippers by trading the Kyrie pick and missing with Al-Farouq Aminu [when Hayward and Paul George went immediately thereafter], then lost Wes Matthews, Nic Batum and Lamarcus Aldridge without finding good replacements.   Olshey drafted Meyers Leonard, one of the most useless NBA players I've ever seen, flipped Will Barton [a Nuggets rotation option] and a 1st for the corpse of Aaron Afflalo, signed Evan Turner in one of the more offensive contracts in NBA history, and has made a ton of other terrible decisions.   That's all ignoring the fact that he didn't bring Paul George to the Blazers because of his own beef with the Pacers, allowing the Thunder to pay Victor Oladipo and Sabonis at a time when neither of them were considered to be real assets. Paul George could've brought the Blazers a ring, in my opinion. Instead, Zach Collins, Anfernee Simmons and Gary Trent will have to lead the line against the likes of Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard and James Harden in the playoffs next year."
Lebron James' superteams have been 7-15 versus those same Warriors. Almost as if they're tough to beat.
"Keyboard warriors are inherently lazy people, morally and politically, so of course they will never boycott Disney, Marvel, Apple etc. Doing so would actually require effort, and they'd rather list all of the ways LeBron James is a hypocrite than contributing to any number of solutions."
"But that’s not evident at all. PR teams certainly help when it comes to things like endorsements, but LeBron James tweeting about politics or Curry instasnapping his daughters are not the same. They don’t do the “majority” at all.   Advertisements alone aren’t how you build a brand. Have a social media in 2020 can prove to be crucial especially for roleplayers. Someone like Nick Young has pretty much created a following through it."
"&gt;I mean Butler has the heat as the 3 seed, and the T wolves were also on that pace before he got injured  This doesn't mean anything. This isn't a good way of measuring how actually good a player is since every player has different circumstances.  Also, the Miami Heat are the 5th seed in the Eastern Conference right now lol  I guess by your logic, Kyle Lowry or Pascal Siakam (depending who you think is the better player for the Toronto Raptors) are better than Anthony Davis since those 2 players helped lead the Toronto Raptors to the 2nd seed in the Eastern Conference this season.  You're using AD's past against him where a lot of his New Orleans Pelicans teams were injured and not the most well built teams. I can easily just say that Anthony Davis, along with LeBron James, helped lead the Lakers to be the 1st seed in the Western Conference this season and this conversation would be over, but I guess that wouldn't count since you would just say that Anthony Davis has LeBron James when the truth is that both the Lakers superstars need each other (and this goes for ever star/superstar duo in NBA history) lol"
LeBron James and not a penny less
"LeBron named himself king James and stunk it up in 2011 with his first real chance to win a chip, no one talks about it because that’s a 6 game series versus his entire fucking career. PG has proven he’s a superstar, 5 games vs Dallas doesn’t make him shit."
"I got bored - decided to look up all 30 team's top scorers for the regular season and what they were shooting from three - as long as they're shooting five or more a game. For teams where the top scorer isn't taking enough threes, I'll use the second highest scorer - if neither is taking enough threes, I'll leave that team blank.  Teams where I used the second highest scorer are marked with an asterisk.  Celtics, Jayson Tatum - 40.3%  Nets, Kyrie Irving - 39.4%  Knicks, Marcus Morris Sr. - 43.9%  *76ers, Tobias Harris - 36.7%  Raptors, Pascal Siakam - 35.9%  Bulls, Zach LaVine - 38%  *Cavaliers, Kevin Love - 37.4%  Pistons, N/A  Pacers, N/A  Bucks, Khris Middleton - 41.5%  Hawks, Trae Young - 36.1%  Hornets, Devonte' Graham - 37.3%  *Heat, Goran Dragic - 36.7%  *Magic, Evan Fournier - 39.9%  Wizards, Bradley Beal - 35.3%  *Nuggets, Jamal Murray - 34.6%  Timberwolves, Karl-Anthony Towns - 41.2%  *Thunder, Dennis Schroder - 38.5%  Trail Blazers, Damian Lillard - 40.1%  Jazz, Donovan Mitchell - 36.6%  Warriors, D'Angelo Russell - 37.4%  Clippers, Kawhi Leonard - 37.8%  *Lakers, LeBron James - 34.8%  Suns, Devin Booker - 35.4%  *Kings, Buddy Hield - 39.4%  Mavericks, Luka Doncic - 31.6%  Rockets, James Harden - 35.5%  *Grizzlies, Jaren Jackson Jr. - 39.4%  Pelicans, Brandon Ingram - 39.1%  Spurs, N/A  That's every team in the league's top scorer that actually shoots threes enough. Embiid shoots worse than all but 1 player listed - a sophomore star on a team that has nobody else to lean on for the kind of scoring he can get.  Every team in the league knows, if you can't shoot the three well enough, you just shouldn't be shooting it, __and that includes the 76ers.__  Other than the Mavs who are trying to build a potential future dynasty around an extremely young star, nobody else has their top scorers shooting threes unless they can hit them at a good enough percentage.  33% isn't good enough, so the 76ers don't have Embiid shoot that shot all that often. He shot it even worse in the playoffs - dropping down to 25%.  There's other centers who shoot the three ball better, so they take more threes.  Or are you going to keep acting like KAT is some kind of unfair comparison?"
If LeBron James is going to be part of an ownership group they’re going to make him the face of it
"It helps put into perspective how far reaching the influence or presence of the actor is. Kinda like saying ""I don't watch basketball but I know who LeBron James is"". He's so influential that people who don't even watch NBA know his name"
What? You think LeBron James complaining about off-court issues plaguing the Lakers in the seeding games was about Chadwick Boseman's private suffering?
The average NBA team valuation is $2.1 billion. This past year valuations increased by 14% on average. That’s over $250 million jump. The cheapest team is the Memphis Grizzlies at $1.3 billion. Their value increased by over $100 million this past year.   I don’t know what Lebron James net worth is but I don’t think it’s more then $500 million. And I dont believe he earns more then $100 million a year in salary + endorsements + investments.  My point is the NBA team valuations seem to be outpacing Lebrons net worth. He’d likely have to partner with an investment group. NBA has limitations of leverage for buying a team. And obviously Lebron can’t liquidate all his net worth to begin with to buy a team.
"This was a shit take of his tbh. People had absolutely every reason to criticize LeBron and the NBA for how they handled the China and the Hong Kong protests situation. For starters, it wasn't that LeBron didn't say anything about the protests to bring awareness. No, he actively DEFENDED China and called Morey uneducated on the matter when he was calling for justice for Hong Kong. People wouldn't have cared if he just didn't say anything on the issue, as he doesn't have to. But he took the worst possible route by siding with China over the Hong Kong protesters. It made LeBron out to be a huge hypocrite, especially after how much he preaches about how much he cares about human rights and social justice issues. He only cares about the ones that don't put a dent in his already infinitely deep pocket, and the NBA is the same way. Us working class people don't have the money or influence to make even a remote change in China and Hong Kong. But the NBA and LeBron James sure as hell do. SVG completely missed the point with this."

"that makes sense, but its not a guarantee either they will be, but with injured players I like those odds.  Load management works. If they won't want load management, they either have to reduce the schedule or reduce the back to backs to almost none.   I like watching the regular season but I think the nba has done a poor job of marketing the regular season. That's even before the load management stuff. the nba haven't created stars and rode lebron james too much. The biggest star outside lebron james was steph curry and whatever momentum was had was killed when KD(nike) joined the team."

"The Odd Couple discussed this in depth a couple of days ago on Youtube. Their take is James will not be on Ali's level since he pretty much risked everything and went years without income due to his beliefs. However, Ali made huge mistakes which he was never called out for like ""The rumble in the jungle"" which was a ""black"" country but was a dictatorship, which committed horrible crimes against their people, and he kept his mouth shut. Meanwhile, Lebron has done more things that have a tangible impact for minorities. It's a really good listen."

"Just like people said LeBron James and the NBA should be taking stands on this because they can without losing their jobs like regular Americans, I'm sorry I expect the same for this considering he's actively profiting off the modern day version of Nazi Germany. And that's not even hyperbole. China is a big fucking problem and, unfortunately, you're right, I do lack the power to do something.  Anything LeBron has to say on social justice should be taken with extreme levels of salt. He's cares about his money. That's it. And that's okay to say on a topical thread like this one."

"&gt;I found it troubling when Lebron James chose to not speak on the injustices occurring in China when he was asked and is now a social justice warrior . Seems a bit ingenious   Completely warranted. But is it really worth holding that grudge when he's backing a topic not only with near-full colleague support, but with a message that can potentially cause good? If you've ever voted, there was almost certainly a person you supported who did something at t one point which you disagreed with. But it didn't change the vote or render that particular candidate obsolete.  And to his credit, Bron has been fighting for social issues and reform long before the China incident so it's not like he's pulling this act out of thin air. But I don't wanna even go into that because it shouldn't play a role in this.  Nike shit, yeah. Again I  don't wanna go into it because it's not the point. The point is that we can't do nothing and expect change. And sadly even if we do something, it's not likely to take. So we start at the bottom by voting. And hope that it leads to the kind of reform which will inevitably never come. If we accept that things won't change and only get worse, then we're fucked. And....we're fucked. I'm booking it to Sweden first chance."
"I think you're underestimating what it would look like for them to try to continue to play without Lebron James and the ripples it would have.  If Lebron stepped away there's a bunch of players who would step away with him, guaranteed.  The NBA goes where he goes."
"I'm glad you brought this up.   Because people have come out and criticized the players and the NBA for having the convenience of their bank accounts and an occupation that won't fire them immediately for boycotting work.   The defense has been, ""Well yeah! That's exactly why they should be leading the fight and leading the example. Because they can.""  And that's a fair and proper response.   The NBA and LeBron James are an international brand. They pick and chose to not only ignore the injustice in China despite having the platform to do something, but to actively censor any discussion at all."

He's saying that to speak out like that while representing an entire franchise will negatively affect people. The people LBJ and others care *most* about. Society isn't some all encompassing thing where we are glass figures and placing more value on those you value more should be condemned to damnation. That's some grade A bullshit and just virtue signaling if you advocate for such a thing as you yourself don't live it. No one does. Everyone places intrinsic value on those they care most about. Unless you are traveling to every country for every negative event and helping, you are being just as fucking hypocritical.   Everyone has their own problems; placing your problems ahead of others doesn't make you a bad person; it makes you *human* and by doing so you are probably doing more good than bad anyway.

"I remember the one sane kid that ran out onto the court like an insane person, but instead of just a message of hate, he only asked Lebron to come back.  Genuinely wonder if that helped Lebron decide to return.  Just found an interview with him actually.  Seems like a badass dude:  &gt;I would have to agree I guess it is considered my ""claim to fame"" even though that was never the intention out of it. I would like to say that my claim to fame is my high school valedictorian speech, something I did for a charity or helped an individual, but that definitely is what people recognize me or know me by.  https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2017/05/31/lebron-james-james-blair-talks-cavs-stormed-court"
"Yes, we are all aware of his sources. We are also aware that SAS has been wrong as often as he’s been right.   Especially when old biddy gossip like “I’m hearing Lebron James has expressed an interest in punching Kyrie Irving in the face” comes into play..."
"&gt;While all of this is said to have occurred, one of the major voices of reason or aggression reportedly in this case perhaps, was the Miami Heat’s, Udonis Haslem. Not only did he reportedly grill George Hill of the Milwaukee Bucks, but he checked former Teammate LeBron James about the process.  &gt;That’s just it! How many other players have the cache, the bravado, and/or the clout to do that? The answer is not many.  &gt;That’s why he is still on the Miami Heat’s roster today. You need a guy that is fearless when it comes to saying the things that need to be said.   This article doesn't state what he actually said. That's what I'm really interested about"
"&gt;Yeah, in the first round against bad teams.  Bad teams? Lmfao   #1 seed 2015 Warriors   #1 seed 2018 Warriors   #3 seed 2018 Blazers.  &gt;If you are only looking at stats and not watching the games, yeah it has been impressive. If you actually realize that he has been the best player on his own team once out of four games and that   Dude, every player in the world is worse than LeBron James...that’s not a knock on AD.  &gt;he is playing a god awful squad that has been blown out in almost every game, then it doesn't look that good.  That “god awful squad” beat the Rockets...  Have you also considered the reason they’re getting blown out is because AD and LeBron are really good?..I know it’s hard for you to comprehend that."
"here's his exact quote, bolded emphasis mine.   &gt;“I think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could tweet or could say (could affect people),” James said. “We all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others, and you’re only thinking about yourself.  &gt;“I don’t want to get into a word or sentence feud with **Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially,** but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.”    in case you forgot or never saw what Morey originally tweeted  https://twitter.com/NormanHermant/status/1181035449973800960   just going back to this  &gt;“I think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could tweet or could say (could affect people),” James said.  That's so fucking ignorant of him to say when Morey was standing for the protesters of Hong Kong who were being snatched off the street and shipped off to concentration camps or dumped in the ocean and ruled suicide. Lebron James spoke out against someone speaking out against that shit, it's inexcusable at every level as human being.  - The only one that wasn't educated at the time was Lebron and he shoulda shut the fuck up."
"&gt; The fact they've both have done it before? TIL Nurkic and Whiteside (the block hunter himself) are good defenders, who knew.  Done what?   Dominate in the playoffs? AD has done that.  Play well against Houston? AD has done that.  &gt;James Harden is averaging 32/8/9 on 60% TS without LeBron James giving him easy looks and taking defensive attention from him, that's a pretty big difference.  Yeah and that’s just offense. Want to compare their defense now?  &gt;There's also a pretty big difference between the 44-28 OKC Thunder with their 7th ranked defense to the 35-39 Blazers and their 28th ranked defense.  There’s also a big difference between the 1st seed Lakers and 4th seed Rockets.  &gt;Portland is a bad team and even then AD hasn't been that impressive. Wake me up when he drops 40+ and shows up in the fourth quarter against a good playoff team.  Holy fuck, 30/11/5 on 59 TS% per 36 with DPOY defense isn’t impressive?  What even is your argument? The Lakers are the 1st seed in the West by far and are up 3-1 against the Blazers even with a historically terrible shooting night in Game 1. They will be heavy favorites against the Rockets (assuming they even advance lmfao)."
"It's like Lebron James playing for African country because he's African American. Zubac and his family is born and raised in Bosnia Hercegovina, but he identifies as a Croat and plays for them."

"&gt;They had LeBron James.  And still lost in 6 to the Magic, even with a miraculous buzzer beater by LeBron.  It’s probably because Dwight was being guarded by Ilgauskas..."
They had LeBron James.
"   ## The Miami Heat took part in the heated NBA strike discussions over the last few days. It is reported that the OG, Udonis Haslem, had a ton to say.  The [**Miami Heat**](https://allucanheat.com/miami-heat-commentary/) and the NBA came to a stop. A standstill. A complete and utter shutdown of the NBA restart and playoffs as we had come to know them in this bubble.  As a result of the senseless and horrendous [**shooting of Jacob Blake**](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/27/us/jacob-blake-shooting-what-we-know/index.html), a Kenosha, Wisconsin man who is now paralyzed after an officer fired seven shots into his back from near barrel to back range, the NBA players took a stand. For them, apparently enough was enough.  Having not played a game since Tuesday, the players eventually voted to resume the season. That whole process wasn’t without drama though.  Reportedly, things got heated between some players. Some players wondered about the lack of communication. Others wondered about how some of the players that were out front had put some of their fellow players *out there* or hung them out to dry with their statements.  While all of this is said to have occurred, one of the major *voices of reason* or *aggression*[ **reportedly**](https://sports.yahoo.com/inside-the-emotional-48-hours-that-saved-the-nb-as-bubble-050354990.html) in this case perhaps, was the Miami Heat’s, [**Udonis Haslem**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hasleud01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-). Not only did he reportedly grill George Hill of the Milwaukee Bucks, but he checked former Teammate [**LeBron James**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-) about the process.  ## The Miami Heat continue to roster Udonis Haslem, even at the age of 40. This has a lot to do with the reason why.  That’s just it! How many other players have the cache, the bravado, and/or the *clout* to do that? The answer is not many.  That’s why he is still on the Miami Heat’s roster today. You need a guy that is *fearless* when it comes to saying the things that need to be said.  You need a guy who understands the *bigger picture*, whether that be a team’s ultimate goals or the ultimate goals of a movement or demonstration such as the one put on by the NBA over the last few days.  I would dare to say, if the Miami Heat had of had *this* Haslem or a guy like this Haslem in the 2011 NBA Finals, they wouldn’t have lost.  *This guy* or a guy like him, wouldn’t have ever allowed them to go down that way. He would have never allowed the second greatest basketball player ever in LeBron (arguably the greatest), a top-three two-guard ever in [**Dwyane Wade**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wadedw01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-), and one of the 50 greatest players ever in [**Chris Bosh**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/boshch01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-), to lose that series.  I won’t believe that. That is what has been on display from Haslem over the last few days, according to reports."
I am praying to the basketball gods that our lord and savior Lebron James can demolish the Clippers and send them back to their irrelevant step son rightful position in the LA basketball team hierarchy.
&gt; Stephen A. Smith reports that younger players told him that LeBron James spoke during the players meeting like he was above the rest of the NBA.
"I mean, you can just check out this article if you really can’t comprehend what LeBron’s was talking about or what he really meant: https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2019-10-14/lebron-james-comments-show-how-business-tops-nba-china-agenda-an  Beyond that, I think we’re done."
"Too many nephews on here want to treat labor union and social justice activism and real life shit into an extension of their NBA season story lines.   ""Lebron James failed to get a unity vote at the last hour, NOT CLUTCH!"" ""Patrick Beverly yelled at a union representative during a union dispute, DIRTY PLAYER!!"" ""Jaylen Brown top 5 activist players after this season?"" Go watch pro wrestling"
I'm waiting for LeBron James to release a statement himself instead of listening to these second hand knuckleheads interpret what people said LeBron James did and meant.
"I believe SAS  I know I'll probably get downvoted because most of yall feel like Lebron can do no wrong but from the outside looking in, Lebron always seemed to be that type. The type to ""lil bro"" you to prop himself up. The dude goes by King James for crying out loud. It's all about delivery and you can rub people the wrong way by how certain things come out. Just because you're the best basketball player in the league doesn't make you the most knowledgeable and just because someone is younger doesn't make them clueless"
"My post was just an attempt at some obvious sarcasm unrelated to your post . After reading your post I did think “what can we do?” I think the reason people are so frustrated on both sides is because we can’t really do anything . Wether you feel systemic racism is abundant and effecting people today - or wether you feel the police have an impossible job and are not being treated with the respect they deserve - no matter what side your on - “what can you do?” NBA players sitting out a game is an empty jester , I don’t think it will help save a life or prevent a business from burning down . NIKE “just do it “ slogan should be “just do what “? with a bunch of suggestions .  I found it troubling when Lebron James chose to not speak on the injustices occurring in China when he was asked and is now a social justice warrior . Seems a bit ingenious  I"
"If we're going to be honest the players aren't willing to make the sacrifice of not earning any money.  The idea that they were going to just cancel the season wasn't realistic. It would require them basically giving up their standard of living. People always think of the NBA in terms of the Stars. They forget that not everyone has f u money like LeBron James.  Many NBA players support their entire families. I'm guessing that during the pandemic this is become even more of a burden.  Because of the Morey tweeting China has stopped broadcasting NBA games. Because of covid-19 there are no ticket revenues. The NBA salary cap was already going to take a devastating hit.  cancelling the rest of these playoffs and not even making the television money would have been devastating for the league. sooner or later those television networks are going to ask for some of their money back for games not being played. They will say the NBA failed to honour its contracts, and they will likely win in court.  NBA players aren't ready to potentially kill the NBA.  and to be fair to them let me ask you the question are you willing and ready to make no money? If every single person in America refuse to go to work until we had racial Justice it would also cause rapid change. The problem is we all still need to eat to live."
Say what you will about the guy but there is pretty much no denying that LeBron James is a leader on and off the court.   You may disagree with some of his stances or think that his leadership is wrong (it certainly has been at times) but objectively the guy is a proven leader and has been for well over a decade now.
Different type of coaches. Kenny is great for a developing team that needs to focus on making its players better first and winning games second. Lue on the other hand has won a championship while coaching Lebron James.   Kenny is the perfect coach for the Knicks while Lue is not. That doesn’t apply to every team
"Per the LA Times:   &gt; Many players demanded answers from the Bucks about why they blindsided everyone. Celtics star Jaylen Brown reportedly rose to their defense. It was their sudden willingness to not play a game without a fully formed plan for what to do next that irked many, including James. Especially after Milwaukee players made it known that they wanted to continue the season.  &gt;  “The whole thing is, what if it happens again, someone else gets shot in L.A., are we not going to play? Or in Utah, or Portland.”  [Source](https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2020-08-27/how-lebron-james-and-nba-players-decided-to-continue-playing)"
"LeBron has and always will be calculated. He doesn't do shit off the cuff because he understands every choice he makes is scrutinized and analyzed to a ridiculous degree. So it makes a lot of sense he's upset that they just decided to boycott but had no plan or ideas really in place. It was a move that the Bucks made and I don't fault them for it, just putting perspective as to why James is probably upset about it"
Of course that’s not what I’m talking about. Lebron James has a lifetime endorsement deal with Nike allegedly worth over a Billion dollars. As do most other NBA players for tens- hundreds of million dollars. This is what LBJ was protecting when he told Morey that his comments could affect people financially. Do you really not get the point.
"Wilt's peak volume scoring regular season was 1961-62 (I'm not going to mention the flaws in his offensive game that season, why it wasn't even his best season, et cetera). During that season, he scored 28.7 PTS/75 on +5.7 rTS. Here are regular seasons where people scored more PTS/75 on better rTS (with Wilt's 1961-62 season for listed for reference):  |Player|Season|PTS/75|rTS| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Wilt Chamberlain|1961-62|28.7 PTS/75|\+5.7 rTS| |Stephen Curry|2018-19|28.8 PTS/75 |\+8.4 rTS  | |James Harden|2016-17|28.8 PTS/75 |\+6.0 rTS  | |Adrian Dantley|1985-86|28.8 PTS/75 |\+8.8 rTS  | |Kawhi Leonard|2016-17|29.2 PTS/75 |\+5.7 rTS  | |Karl Malone|1997-98|29.2 PTS/75 |\+7.3 rTS  | |Ricky Pierce|1990-91|29.3 PTS/75 |\+7.1 rTS  | |Kevin Durant|2015-16|29.3 PTS/75 |\+9.3 rTS  | |Yao Ming|2006-07|29.4 PTS/75 |\+6.0 rTS| |Shaquille O'Neal|2001-02|29.4 PTS/75 |\+7.0 rTS| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|2018-89|29.5 PTS/75 |\+8.7 rTS| |Kevin Durant|2009-10|29.6 PTS/75 |\+6.4 rTS  | |Shaquille O'Neal|1998-99|29.7 PTS/75 |\+7.3 rTS  | |Stephen Curry|2017-18|29.9 PTS/75 |\+11.9 rTS  | |Michael Jordan|1988-89|30.0 PTS/75 |\+7.7 rTS  | |LeBron James|2009-10|30.0 PTS/75 |\+6.1 rTS  | |Karl Malone|1996-97|30.0 PTS/75|\+6.4 rTS  | |Shaquille O'Neal|1997-98|30.1 PTS/75 |\+6.3 rTS  | |Karl Malone|1989-90|30.5 PTS/75 |\+8.9 rTS  | |Kevin Durant|2013-14|31.4 PTS/75 |\+9.4 rTS  | |James Harden|2017-18|31.7 PTS/75 |\+6.3 rTS  | |Isaiah Thomas|2016-17|31.8 PTS/75 |\+7.2 rTS  | |Stephen Curry|2015-16|31.9 PTS/75 |\+12.8 rTS  | |Michael Jordan|1990-91|32.0 PTS/75 |\+7.1 rTS  | |Michael Jordan|1989-90|32.0 PTS/75 |\+6.9 rTS  | |Michael Jordan|1987-88|32.7 PTS/75 |\+6.5 rTS  | |James Harden |2018-19|36.2 PTS/75|\+5.9 rTS  |  This is purely judging them based on scoring. People will bring up the argument that Wilt played 48.5 MPG, but I think that speaks more to his endurance and physical shape than his scoring ability.  If you want to discuss post-season scoring, where most players tend to have a more difficult time, Wilt still wouldn't be the best (Jordan for one is definitely better, and there's quite a few more you could add to the list)."

Yea you don’t watch basketball.   Warriors beat 1 seed mavs in playoffs year dirk won mvp.   And na again for somebody who doesn’t know how scheduling works you play 2 games against everybody on the west and like 4 against people in your conference. Meaning not only is Lebron cursing to the playoffs. The teams he was playing (and himself) are getting beat the fuck up by the west in the reg season.   Meaning all of them collectively have fewer wins on that side as a whole.   And you know why the folks in the west don’t have more rings (which is stupid we will revisit that in a sec) it was because they were having 2-3 60 win teams brawling over there while Lebron plays some 48 win team in The ECF    Also.  Kobe got 5 rings  Tim got 5  Curry got 3  Durant got 2  Why am I not shitting on them for having more rings? Are you seriously this fucking stupid.. THEY WERE PLAYING EACH OTHER FOR THE CHANCE TO SLAUGHTER LEBRON IN THE FINALS ESSENTIALLY. AND SOME OF THEM HAVE MORE IF NOT THE SAME AMOUNT OF RINGS THAN LEBRON ON LESS TRIPS TO THE FINALS.  Do you know what parity means Jesus Christ    And yes you do when you have good teammates surrounding you like half of the top 25 in the nba consistently. Nobody else in league history has had it like that and lost this much cut it the fuck out and stop dickeating Lebron.    Name another player that has gotten his handpicked choice of teammates on 4 different NBA rosters.   Lebron will never be on the same level as Jordan Kobe Kareem Bill Bird Duncan he not built like them and he didn’t dominate like them.    These people denied mfers rings. Lebron let people who weren’t even supposed to get a ring win.  2011 mavs and 2015 warriors.   Lebron will go down as the same player Magic Johnson was. Out shadowed by the people that beat him.   And Durant joined a team that complimented him he didn’t go trying to force roster moves and (he also had a way worse GM the man traded harden for a bacon sandwich) He still  tore Lebron ass up for 35 a night. Durant up  2-1 on Lebron btw.   He had the best record in a season that was cut short by like 15 games too........... but hey let’s leave stuff out cause king James the goat with one scoring title and an assist title in his whole career lol. And 23 all star teammates to help him get to 9 finals.    Still waiting for you to show me somebody remotely close to that lol
"People are stupid, they also said the Blazers, a team that was 26-39 before the bubble and struggled to win games with Dame dropping 50+, were the most dangeours 8 seed ever.  Portland didn't have wing defenders to throw at LeBron James, CJ McCollum is hurt and their bigs can't keep up with Anthony Davis. The only thing Portland had going for them was Damian Lillard and even him (as it is becoming the norm btw) didn't show up.  I don't think people understand how bad Dame is playing in this series against the Lakers and how bad he played in last year's WCF vs Golden State. Him and CJ were the strong points for Portland and both have been underwhelming.  If you think that James Harden and Russell Westbrook will struggle like this, then yeah, Houston will get obliterated, but even then Houston has guys like RoCo and PJ Tucker to throw at LeBron and is a FAR better team than Portland ever was.  Just fyi, there are plenty of teams that the Lakers would love to play, those are: Denver, Utah, Dallas, Milwaukee and Miami. Lakers will obliterate any team that depends on size and interior play, but their bad matchups are against guard heavy squads (Houston) as their perimeter defenders are lackluster af, how hard is that to understand?"
"Every franchise player you ever had has left the Raptors. Damon Stoudamire, Chris Bosh, Vince Carter, T-Mac and Kawhi. You have to recruit internationals before they actually see the USA to keep them in Toronto. Your franchise made the finals a total of 0 times before last year and is a notorious LeBron James playing ground. We literally won 2 chips in the 3 years before the NBA and ABA merged, only if you ignore that are Brooklyn and Toronto comparable.  Hope that helps."
"Has he? Tyronn Lue has never won a single NBA game as a head coach without Lebron James on the roster. Even the year he took over for Blatt mid season, they had a better record with Blatt as coach than they did with Lue."
You can also be on the side that is consistent. What is happening to black people in America is wrong and how Lebron James handled China is wrong. Of course what happening here is more pressing especially for his community however that doesn’t give him an excuse to say what he did about the gm.

You're definitely [missing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/us/politics/stephen-ayesha-curry-endorse-biden.html) some of the [activism](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/lebron-james-trae-young-and-other-stars-form-voting-rights-group-ahead-2020-election).
"Well you need to do some more research, because LBJ called Morey uneducated, and actively lobbied Adam Silver to have him reprimanded in some form for speaking his mind. That is hypocrisy.  Once again, you are comparing a working class income person who would fail to eat in this day and age if I completely boycott Chinese products, which would almost certainly be impossible anyways.  I discuss the logistics on that more in this comment here: np.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/ihz86n/comment/g34u49y  Remember that almost every digital device there is had PCB or some item that was made or sourced in China way up the supply chain. Just finding a product would be difficult, forgetting the price.  But also, you are comparing that sacrifice of living standards to LeBron James, who is worth nearly half a million dollars, owns a movie studio and a piece of the Liverpool football club. To make even more money than me or you could dream of, he then persecuted Morey for speaking his opinion (the same thing he is doing now) and attempted to get him reprimanded and spouted Chinese propaganda while having the biggest platform in sports.  The NBA and LeBron James thrive without China, but actively support the oppression of people to get more money. Isn't that what the walkout is all about? Trying to get people who are richer than God to take action that supports peole being wrongfully oppressed? The players like LBJ, could've agreed to not go play in China, just like they walked out of these playoff games.  But they didn't. What do you think the difference was?  Another point: Holding gov't officials accountable for issues with China doesn't mean I can't hold LBJ accountable as well. It's weird that people argue that it doesn't matter since ""what could LBJ do anyways"" when that's one of the biggest arguments people have about the walk outs right now. ""How would it change anything anyways? Like that's gonna make a difference.""  The double standards here are very apparent"
"so much Trump hate it these threads, folks need to get a grip.  LeBron isn't going to be a political force.  He was actively campaigning for Hillary.  Everyone knows he doesn't like Trump.  Those that would actually allow someone like LeBron James to sway their political opinions are already swayed by him."
LeBron James Madison
"It's more about boosting voter turnout than it is trying to swing undecided voters in one direction or the other. Basically, someone like LeBron James is trying to help people get registered and use their voice. Obviously he has his preferences on who they vote for -- but his role is not to sway the undecided voters of the country, it's to get people out to vote.   Better voter turnout in a few key states (including his home state of OH) could very easily impact this election in a major way.  People outside of politics (and a lot of pundits) are infatuated with undecided voters but really the vast majority of effort, especially on the Dem side, is just making sure your base turns out to vote. LeBron's celebrity and influence can most definitely be a helpful tool when it comes to that."
The heat had 3 top 15 players on it al in their prime.   The mavs starting lineup was 32-36 years old and led by two guys that were exiting their prime in their last finals match 4 years ago. Peja was 38 years old and barley kicking it out there smh.    You aren’t really trying to rationalize Lebron losing to old men he shouldn’t have.... you’re fucking autistic lol   Esp considering d Wade beat that same team with less help and dirk won the mvp that next season In 07....   So in a nutshell the mavs literally got worse and the heat got the “best player in the nba” didn’t even make it to 7 games against old men   /n I can’t comment every 30 fucking seconds lie you can it’s a slow mode on here slow the fuck down and stop trying to talk over me with that dumb shit.  I’m also commenting to you saying the number of all stars didn’t matter.....   Yes it does even if you take out the ones that weren’t all stars while he was there he still has 7  more than  Jordan did lol.   Lebron had more  help than any nba superstar and has done jack shit with it.Which is a weird contradiction    The goat shouldn’t need all this help to be great if he is the goat right?    92 trades 23 all star teammates 3-6 in the finals....... but I’m the troll here lol. You calling for a glorified Magic Johnson(that’s who his legacy will be just like)    Both of them compared while playing the list was made in 18 so it’s missing somebody :)   https://fadeawayworld.net/2018/06/15/lebron-james-has-played-with-more-than-double-the-amount-of-all-stars-than-michael-jordan-has/
"&gt;did you just say both are leaders behind championship runs?  Um, yeah. That's the whole premise of this post *if* he wins it this year. Did you not read OP?  &gt;Also, Wade is a 3-time champion   Ugh, I really hate ring counting. As far as I'm concerned, Harden has had multiple playoff runs on par with Wade in 2013, Wade just had LeBron James.  &gt;increase in playoff performance   This is hilariously irrelevant."
"Honestly when he was talking about quitting every time you lost and finding an excuse I couldn’t help think of LeBron James. LBJ will go down in the books as a MUCH better teammate as Wilt (as he should) but I can’t help but think that he has a similar career. All the talent in the world, unreal stats and a physical specimen but never won as much as they should have."
"Going to piggy back off the top comment:  Hey u/SmokingFrog don't you think it's kinda crummy to post a response but ""lock"" your comment so people can't respond?  So just because that one thread includes the one line about having 0 points in the 4th quarter it's all encompassing?  This thread specifically calls out LeBron's 4th quarter performance:  [ESPN Stats and Info] LeBron scores 0 in the fourth quarter of a playoff game for the third time in his career  As does this thread:  Lebron James scored zero points in the fourth quarter in the Lakers game 1 loss to the Rockets  Yet the thread you're leaving up is:  Kawhi vs Denver Nuggets tonight - 13/10/7 with 4 turnovers on 24/0/71 splits  And the second to last sentence in the post being ""oh also Kawhi scored 0 in the 4th"".  The two LeBron threads I found were discussions specifically around his 4th quarter performance. The Kawhi thread is around his overall performance with a nod to his 4th quarter performance.  These are not equal.  Edit: furthermore, the fact that there are multiple LeBron 4th quarter performance threads still up is equally problematic if the mods really prefer the ""one thread per topic"" sort of rule. If I posted the same Kawhi thread with his stat lines but focused almost entirely on his 4th quarter play, that would be allowed then right? Because multiple LeBron threads on the same topic were allowed up."
"https://www.nba.com/celtics/news/sidebar/misc-052319-kyries-historic-season-earns-all-nba-second-team-honors  “during the 2018-19 season. That would be a mistake. The reality is that Irving wasn’t just good this season, and he wasn’t just great. He was historic as he tallied averages of 23.8 points per game and a career-best 6.9 assists per game while shooting 48.7 percent from the floor and 40.1 percent from long range.  Yes, he was the only player to reach the numbers outlined above this season, but that’s only the tip of this statistical iceberg. There is far more gravity to this story. Let’s walk up the ladder of significance.  There are now two names in the Boston Celtics history book that have recorded a 23-6-48-40 season. One is Irving. The other is Larry Bird, who accomplished the feat four times.  There are only four names in the NBA’s history book that have recorded such a season. One is Irving. The others are Bird (four times), Stephen Curry (three times) and LeBron James (one time).”"

I want to add this post made by the mod in question:   #An Op-Ed to r/nba: Why I Hated LeBron James  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/awln7j/an_oped_to_rnba_why_i_hated_lebron_james/
"Essentially, +/- is the score difference for when they were on the court. Bad wording, but here are some examples:  &gt;LeBron James has a +/- of +15. When he was on the court, his team outscored the opposing team by 15 points throughout the entirety he played.  &gt; Patrick Beverly has a +/- of -73. When he was on the court, his team was outscored by the opposing team by 73 points, and he even tacked on 14 turnovers and 6 personal fouls.   That's basically the gist of it."
"The fact you mention Cazzie Russell in 75-76 when he was averaging 12 a game is just hilarious. You say:     "" And, think about this... in Kareem's 71-72 season, he averaged a career high 44.2 mpg, and a career high, 34.8 ppg, on .574 shooting. That Bucks team went 63-19, and had a scoring differential of +11.1 ppg. So how come a more physically prime Kareem, could only play 41.2 mpg, and only average 27.7 ppg on .529 shooting in that 75-76 season, when his Laker team obviously needed him to step up?""     So you just ignore the higher pace and the fact he didn't play with a single good ball-handler/playmaker who could help him increase his scoring.     Also, why the fuck are you making a big deal about 44 minutes vs 41 minutes. The guy didn't stat pad we have seen guy's efficieny drop when their teammates can't hit the tough shots. Hell, he had one 19 PPG scorer and one 15 PPG scorer and that's it.  The team clearly had terrible perimeter defense proven by their attrocious 13th place defense. Also, you do realize how god awful this laker squad was the year before was right? They had the 16th out of 18 best offense in the league and the literal worst defense. This team was just trash.      I agree tho with the fact that Nate Thurmond outplaying him is kinda bad. Wilt doing so isn't suprising tho. Ben Wallace use to give Shaq the fits more than any other player because he was a guy who used all of his energy on defense and rebounding. Wilt was an iimproved version of this due to him mainly only throwing outlet passes while Jerry and Gail ran a fast pace run and gun style that created one of the best offenses ever. This gave Wilt the ability to save all his energy on rebounding and defense. Wilt's defense was so good he could finish top three in MVP voting some years (72). Wilt should've been the one to give Kareem efficienct fits. The reason above is one; however, it's also important to realize how inefficient Oscar and Dandridge played in those series' which forced Kareem to carry the scoring load entirely. We have seen these things in series' like Lebron against GSW in 2015 where a player has to carry the load and is matched with a strong defender (i.e. Igudola).      I don't really want to keep going but basically I think there is a lot of context that goes with all this. I do, however, kinda agree with 78. I think that the Lakers had a lot of great names (Adrian Dantley was putting good numbers on a bad team. Had he stayed on the Pacers they would've only been on pace for 32 wins. Jamaal Wilkes wasn't great yet), but they probably should've beaten the Sonics. But who puts that much stock in a best of three series. Kareem played well.      NVM I'll keep on going! Look, Magic was always great, but the Lakers won in 1980 because of Kareem. Magic was the final guy needed for a ring. In 82' Magic was the best player on the squad, but this was kinda a 2014 Spurs situation, just with stars. Magic was the best, but he certainly was not massively better than Kareem in the regular season. In the playoffs, Magic was still the best, but the team was stacked with talent. Norm Nixon, Jamaal Wilkes, and Kareem all averaged 20 PPG in the Playoffs.     From 83 to 85, I always felt it was more of a 1a. and 1b. situation. Magic was better obviously, but in a given series Kareem could be the better player. It's kinda like with Kobe and Shaq in 2001/2002 or KD and Steph. Really, I feel we don't give Kareem enough credit for these years.     In 86, Magic was clearly #1, Kareem #2, James Worthy #3.    In 87, Magic was #1, Worthy, #2, Kareem #3   In 88, Magic was #1, Worthy #2, Byron Scott #3     I do like your mentions of Moses Malone; he was clearly the Best Player in the World those years. Sad most people don't realize."
"Roughly in no order  1. Michael Jordan 2. Bil Russel 3. Elgin Baylor 4. Jerry West 5. Dr J 6. Wilt Chamberlain 7. Hakeem 8 Kareem 9. Magic 10. Larry Bird 11. Charles Barkley 12. David Robinson 13. Shaq 14. Tim Duncan 15. Karl Malone 16. Kobe 17. Lebron James 18. Chris Paul 19. Kevin Garnett 20. Harden 21. Kawhi 22. Curry 23. Giannis 24. Pippen 25. Zeke 26. Dwight Howard 27. Kevin Durant 28. Oscar Robertson 29. Dirk Nowitzki  30. Dwayne Wade 31. Steve Nash 32. Moses Malone 33. Iverson 34. Stockton 35. Lowkey guys like Chauncey Billups, Tony Parker, Paul Pierce"
"Also his FMVP in 2014 was one of the least clear-cut I can think of, only one that comes close in recent memory is Iggy in 2015.   For some reason that FMVP he got while on the Spurs is talked about as though his impact was superstar-esque. In reality, he got the award for basically just being the player assigned with defending Lebron James (and doing it well); that was probably the most well-rounded team effort I’ve seen since the 2004 pistons. Kawhi was great, don’t get me wrong, but that first FMVP award will always feel a bit more hollow than others in comparison"
I cannot tell you a single time that LeBron James has lost a playoff game or series due to poor free throw shooting in the clutch.
“In an unprecedented move Thursday morning NBA commissioner Adam Silver has approved a trade that will send LeBron James to the Brooklyn Nets for a future second round pick.   This news comes as a shock as the NBA trade deadline is supposed to be in February. When asked for comment both Adam Silver and the Los Angeles Lakers both has the same thing to say: ‘Lol’”
I remember people criticizing his fitness and blaming the lack of it for his FT misses in OT while completely forgetting that the man was on court for 60 minutes in that game. Motherfucking LeBron James would be knackered after playing that much in a single game.
Lmfao no he didn’t. 🤣 LeBron literally gave himself the name king James. You guys are stupid.
The lakers matchup really bad vs the rockets. It’s like the rockets vs the thunder but even worse. They don’t have anyone to stop James harden. There guards aren’t good enough to create beat there man like OKC guards. AD might eat but at what cost. Doubling harden works occasionally but it will lead to a lot of open shots. If they run the bigs they will get abused on offense and the rockets have a good enough team defense to stop the ball from getting into a bigs hands consistently. Westbrook has cooked against the lakers since microball. It’s just not pleasant. LeBron and AD need to combine for 70 for the lakers to overcome the disadvantages the team has
That's a hell of a photo and I love it  But I mean more of this angle (Lebron game winner on Butler): https://www.fearthesword.com/2018/2/8/16990164/watch-lebron-james-game-winner-cavs-timberwolves
"One thing I noticed in last night's Houston-Lakers game was some confusion when the announcers used ""James""--sometimes they were talking about Harden, sometimes about LeBron."
There is also literally an NBA player called LeBron James.  And another one called Kawhii Leonard.  This list is a shambles.
"Never thought of it that way. My theory was more along the lines of the NBA becoming boring, so people turn to watch the Chinese league instead, which the government uses to place subliminal messages in americans minds watching the broadcast. One day a Jimmer Fredette dunk unleashes all of the so far hidden messages in this people's head ""we need to destroy the white House, China will prevail"", hence a Civil War is fought in America. Cut to 10 years later, The United States of Beijing are created, Lebron James is the Vice-president and Xi Jinping is the supreme ruler. The end of the world as we know it. It's crazy how opposed our views are."
Kawhi “LeBron ‘Scottie Pippen’ James” Leonard
"I also do not claim to see the game better than a pro NBA coach. What the response was about was whether I think a LeBron James power play for more Rondo minutes was more likely than a coach being headstrong about a PG who ""runs"" his system well."

"Last time I checked Lowry is 34 and James is 35.  And Lowry doesnt give up period. LeBron is having multiple lazy defensive possessions a game.  Either LeBron hasnt aged as well, or he just doesnt have the drive anymore and this in LA is just his cushy retirement job."

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.    People on this subreddit hate Nikola Jokic.    The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you haven’t been watching him in his prime.    Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only like the Lakers. So you never watched anyone but Lebron James.    And because you haven’t watched big honey in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores.   But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.    Joker’s game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the greatest C ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.    So when I hear somebody say that Kawhi Leonard is better than Nikola Jokic, I laugh, because I know that anybody who has watched the Joker in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Jokic is better.    You might be jealous of Jokic’s 2 all star rings and 2000+ assists, or jealous of his status as one of the greatest players in NBA history, or whatever.   Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.    This sub would make you think that JOKID isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~Kawhi Leonard~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Jokic talk to the adults. Fair?"
"[Serious] LeBron played bad, Giannis played bad, Kawhi played bad, is James Harden the best player in the NBA?"
Lebron is literally Lebron freakin James he doesn’t have to do anything the coach tells him to do lmao
"Starting lineup in LA lead by head coach LeBron James will be Giannis, Tako, Bol Bol, Kristapz and Boban."
Lol people did this to LeBron James of all people after a mediocre performance last night. Nobody is proven enough to be immune.
Either works.  The vast majority of times Lebron is mentioned it’s by his first name but you still hear “James” every now and then
"&gt;Look at LeBron’s drive rate this season compared to past seasons  Uh, it's the highest it's been since they started tracking it:  &gt;LeBron is actually averaging more drives this season than he has since tracking data became publicly available seven years ago. Right now he’s tallying **13.8** drives per game. In reverse chronological order starting with the 2018-19 season, his drives have been 12.4, 11.7, 11.3, 11.1, 13.2, and 9.4  He drives 2.5 times more per game and gets roughly half the free throws Giannis does (1.7 v 3).  That's a 43% lower FTr than Giannis does.  Even compared to his past self, he drives 43% more than he did in 2013-14 and shoots 25% less free throws.

Lol. Thank you for showing how dumb you are. You think lebron played better simply bc he dunked on a guy twice. My God reddit never fails to amaze me  Next up James Johnson better than Curry because he dunked on him
"If he was at least an average shooter( from the field and the line), he’d be indisputably the best player in the league, like no argument. I don’t even want to think of a Giannis with an above average jump shooter. A guy who is one facet away from being an unquestionably all time player at his age is not overrated, or rather, he is by people who just look at highlights, headlines, and stats. Everyone in the world knows his weaknesses, they just were not as glaring when they were dominating the regular season. If anything, I’m sure not playing bottom East teams so many times would have have people see him for what he is rather than just looking at the point differentials, his stats, and then concluding he’s lebron James. Furthermore, the heat played him well all year, they have a game plan. So if you’re listening to narratives and not analysis as to why he’s had such success, you’d think he was something he never was."
Most people here are not LeBron James and don't know the ins and outs of his life
"The 5 most used players from each team for last night's game, from shortest to tallest.  **Houston Rockets**  * Russell Westbrook: 6'3'', 200 lbs, 6'8'' wingspan.  * Eric Gordon: 6'3'', 215 lbs, 6'9'' wingspan.  * James Harden: 6'5'', 220 lbs, 6'9'' wingspan.  * PJ Tucker: 6'5'', 245 lbs, 7'' wingspan.  * Robert Covington: 6'9'', 225 lbs, 7'2'' wingspan.  **Los Angeles Lakers**   * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope: 6'5'', 205 lbs, 6'5.5'' wingspan.  * Danny Green: 6'6'', 215 lbs, 6'10'' wingspan.  * Kyle Kuzma: 6'9'', 220 lbs, 7'0'' wingspan.  * LeBron James: 6'8'', 250 lbs, 7'0'' wingspan.  * Anthony Davis: 6'10'', 253 lbs, 7'6'' wingspan.  Talking about build, the 5 Lakers are only about 5.5 inches longer than the 5 Rockets when it comes to wingspan. Rockets be shorter, but they are not too behind in weight and they are long af."
Especially since you'll take all the heat when things dont go to plan. Nobodys defending you over LeBron James
"If the rockets don't make and win the finals, I REALLY want the Raptors to battle hard and win these next 2 series off buzzer beaters a in 7 games each, get to the finals fully healthy... And then get swept and blown out by the LeBron James led Lakers lol. Just for laughs."
Lol u seriously believe that LeBron fucking James can't give the ball in a position for Giannis to score?
"Houston- I've slowly but surely fallen for James Harden. When he's locked in and not focused in drawing fouls he's so damn fun to watch. Also Westbrook is the basketball energizer bunny from Hell.   Nuggets- Jokic is hilarious and amazing, how can you root against this guy?   Heat- what a likeable team, they play hard they play smart JB is finally getting the love he deserves.   Raptors- Canadian team, named The Raptors, great fans and uniforms and shoving a title in Leonard's face after he left would be really fun.   Lakers- i hate the lakers, laker fans are the only fans that are worse than Celtics fans, I respect Lebron and what he's managed to do at his age but really don't want him to win, don't care for AD either. That being said do it for Kobe."
Lebron James
"But we also didnt have iggy and jae, much better than James Johnson and injured winslow. I still think lakers win because lebron but I think we can handle them better now than in the regular season."
the team that LeBron James play on
"JaVale McGee can't catch the ball. It's bizarre.  The team also misses Avery Bradley in a bad way.   They paid Danny Green too much money.   Rondo and LeBron James can't play together, it just doesn't work."
Lebron “and thats why im the goat” James !
He is an excellent coach if LeBron James is the one coaching the team
"On the James Harden Skills stat, Lebron is near the top."
I mean having LeBron James helps
"Free market economy dictates aftermarket prices for championship rings and a bunch of other variables such as the precious metals used in the ring but for argument sake let’s say the rings are comparable in precious metals I think you would still get more money for two championship final mvp rings  than one. Especially when you factor in the fan base of the teams with golden states fan base being in Northern California, which includes San Francisco and silicon valley and is more affluent. Now if KD two rings were won for like a small market team than it’s possible that one Houston championship ring would go for  more than two.  If you are talking historical worth it all matters if james harden finishes his career in Houston. KD has moved on to Brooklyn, just as Lebron moved on from Miami after 2 championships. Both players will never be the face of their franchises. Those obviously belong to wade for Miami and curry for golden state.  Harden stays at Houston he will be face of Houston franchise and thus one championship will be more meaningful than the two ‘mercenary’ rings KD won for golden state. But that is just my humble opinion."
"Ok allow me to rephrase, I don't think Luka is being over hyped because he is white. I'm sure some people like Luka more because he is white, but I don't think he is being overrated because he is white.   His performance and age are the main factors for his popularity. Do you think he's currently being overrated because of his race? Objectively I think Luka is the best performing young player since Lebron James. His hype seems totally reasonable to me."
"Anymore is the key word, the point is that there were countless of Bucks fans defending Bud before for the way he handled Giannis's minutes in last year's ECF.  Your best player can't play less than 40-42 minutes in the playoffs, that's absolutely ridiculous. The reason deep teams who lack an MVP caliber player generally struggle in the postseason (2015 Hawks, Nuggets now) is that rotations shrink and the best teams are relying on 7-8 guys.  LeBron James averages 42 mpg in the playoffs, i'm not sure Giannis has played 42 minutes ONE GAME under Bud in a game that didn't go to OT in the regular season or playoffs. The funny part is that under Jason Kidd in 2017, he played 46:39 in an elimination Game 6 against Toronto and was absolutely fantastic."
A mediocre Cavs team with Lebron James versus mediocre teams in the east .
"Don't forget about his other son, [LeBron James](https://youtu.be/0spXnX0l638)"
"I'd say LeBron was the one we Lakers fans should be worried about. 20 for him is just not working hard enough. Obviously I wish AD + LBJ would top 50 each night, but 25 points is hardly something to worry over. Kindly look back on the OKC series to see that you won't be able to rely on Russ and James combining for 60 every game."
"Have people literally forgotten LeBron's last playoff run with the Cavs. He was abysmal in Game 1 for the Pacers and Celtics series, with the exception of the Raptors (we all know why) and the Warriors (best chance for him to take control of the series). He uses game 1 as a feel-out game and then uses what he learns throughout the series. Look the Rockets have a chance to beat the Laker, but if I'm the Rockets I want to close this out in 6 if possible. I wouldn't want any part of a game 7 with LeBron James"
"Here's a shitpost that I made in the Miami-Milwaukee game 2 thread that turned out to be prophetic and I wanted to toot my own horn about it.   Guy with Lakers flair says ""Jimmy Butler is Lebron James. Prove me wrong."" I guess that's supposed to be a compliment.

[LeBron James Sends Scary Warning About Anthony Davis: 'We're Just Scratching the Surface'](https://imgur.com/a/6fg3MDO)
"There is some cause for concern for the Lakers, but it's not time to panic yet.   A few thoughts:  • PJ Tucker took AD out of many possessions by simply fronting him. Due to the Lakers offensive inefficiencies from 3, Houston guards were able to come over and ensure that lob passes did not result in easy shots for Davis. The Lakers turned the ball over a lot (especially LeBron) when trying to force it in to him despite the front.  •Typically, what you do as an offense in that case is go high-low by flashing a big to the foul line and lobbing over the top to AD. However, since LeBron was almost always standing out top behind the 3 point line, the Lakers didn't have anyone capable of doing this. Javale McGee has stone hands; there were at least 4 first-half possessions where LA failed to score only due to the fact that he couldn't catch passes properly.  •Houston constantly managed to shrink the floor whenever LeBron had the ball in isolations out top. While James got a few power drives going in the 1st quarter, he was forced to pass out to 3 point shooters a lot, and they simply didn't make their shots. KCP, Green and Kuzma were the biggest culprits.  •The Lakers decided to show Harden to his right on almost every possession where he had the ball, in order to stop his stepback 3s. This was a complete disaster, especially in the 1st half. Harden is most efficient when he drives and either floats it in, draws fouls or kicks it out.  •The Lakers adjusted and showed Harden a few double teams in the second half. These were effective, as they not only stopped him from scoring, but also forced turnovers and made Russ shoot 3 pointers, which he is terrible at.  •Westbrook dominated in 5-out sets when he isolated on the wings. His pull-up jumper from mid-range was money tonight. Vogel put McGee on him to start the game, which went pretty OK, all things considered. However, whenever Harden went out, Russ kept Houston afloat.  •I don't know who Rondo thinks he is, but him constantly pounding the ball time after time when LeBron was on the court right alongside him is crazy. He hit a couple open 3s, but otherwise he was a negative factor, especially with the blown layups. He's been doing this nonsense all season long, and I'd have hoped that Vogel would understand that Rondo and Bron should never be on the court together.  •LA was right in it until the 4th quarter, and they simply appeared to give up mentally in the 4th. A terrible quarter, but something I am certain will not happen again."

"I swear if you combine the box score stats with the superlatives that Westbrook fans say help his team but aren't in the boxscore, you'd expect to find a track record that looked like Lebron James."
"Rondo and James should not be on the court at the same time. Caruso works best with LeBron and AD. For the second unit, when LeBron rests they should get Rondo on the court, which I still feel is replaceable with Dion."
Michael Jordan &gt; Lebron James.
LeBron James had ZERO points in the 4th quarter
Jimmy Butler outscored the Bucks and Lebron James 17-13 in the 4th quarter
That's simply not true. I have better bbq than LeBron James
I expect LeBron to do LeBron things in time but he has a task to keep up with Houston offense. I honestly don’t know how you can be confident in LA’s defense when your best wing defender is sitting at home. There’s nobody to stop Russ or James and tonight showed. Lakers will have to throw doubles at James and for the rest of the rockets to make shots if they want to have a chance. Rockets are bulky guards and forwards that collapse and group defend. Lakers best inside presence is LeBron and he’s already task with everything else WHILE ALSO RUNNING POINT GUARD. I find it hard to believe Rockets lose this series but hey anything can happen
"The overreactionary nature of r/nba is in full effect tonight, and that's ok. The Rockets played and coached a near perfect game they had to play to win. It's not expected the Lakers will continue shooting 40% FG and 26% from 3.      IDC how much I get downvoted for it, but LeBron has always said [this](https://www.wkyc.com/article/sports/nba/cavaliers/lebron-james-on-cleveland-cavaliers-loss-game-1-has-always-been-a-feel-out-game-for-me/95-551881526) (then won the series), they lost game 1 to the Blazers (Houston is a different animal I know).     I just wanna say good game Houston, good thing Bestbrook showed up, and I hope we change rotations to maybe even putting LeBron at center for a few minutes. It might go to 6 or 7, but I still have the Lakers winning."
"LeBron James, Defense, Size if we utilise it.  We were 2-1 against the rockets in the regular season if you don’t include the bubble game where AD and Bron didn’t play.  Either way I never said Lakers are overwhelming favorites, but I do expect us to win."
Lmao so many people post takes like they know more about basketball than Lebron Fucking James. Jesus people the guy has dominated the post season for over a decade lets give him more than a quarter of basketball before we start making declarations.
"I’m saying that in regards to the fact that AD was drafted by Houston’s division rival, New Orleans, which was the same year Houston traded for Harden. Harden and the Rockets have game planned and beat up Davis and NO for 8 straight years. Everybody was over reacting how Davis would just dominate every game but Houston knows his weaknesses. They played him 4 times every year for 8 years (minus the games he was injured). Just look at the game a couple weeks ago when LeBron was out for LA and West was out for Houston. James Haden dropped 34 in 28 minutes blowing an Anthony Davis led LA team out by double digits 💀"

"Jimmy Butler plays winning basketball regardless of his stats. Period. Kawhi Leonard, Lebron James, Jimmy Butler, in that order, is who I’d draft in today’s league for a 7 game series.  Injured players notwithstanding."
"“Game 1 has always been a feel out game, for me, if you've ever followed my history,""  https://www.wkyc.com/article/sports/nba/cavaliers/lebron-james-on-cleveland-cavaliers-loss-game-1-has-always-been-a-feel-out-game-for-me/95-551881526"
We can thank LeBron James. Superteams are his fuckin' legacy.
"I can't possibly be the only one who feels this way.  First of all, the Heat are awesome. Jimmy Butler is who he says he is, and those guys aren't afraid of/impressed by anyone. If they get the Celtics in the ECF, we're getting a Lakers-Heat Finals and I would not engrave the O'Brien Trophy just yet.  Second, what on *Earth* is going on with Giannis? If this is who he is then he needs to keep James Harden's name the flip out of his mouth. You know how I could tell LeBron was the best player in the league? When stuff stopped being someone else's fault. When they stopped saying, ""Shaquille O'Neal isn't a good enough sidekick, guess he needs to go hang with the 2nd-best player in the league."" I'm probably going to die on the ""LeBron-and-Kawhi-are-gonna-run-the-league-until-further-notice"" hill, but I'd rather die on *that* hill than the one Giannis stans are rolling down right now. I was watching a Clippers-Lakers game and Smith called LBJ and Kawhi the ""two best players in the league,"" and Barkley goes, ""I don't see Giannis in here anywhere."" If the media is going to try and turn this antisocial Wilt into the Yasser Arafat of basketball while Adebayo and Beverley  are still in the league, he better be able to deal with a 6-7 Jordan impersonator with a beer ad and a bad haircut."
"LeBron James on the mausoleum floor... The stuff writes itself, I'm sure someone will steal it in time"
"I’m really not looking forward to it at all. Lol. I hate all the hype and people saying we can sweep them or win in five. Like, this is Lebron fucking James. Until this series is over and we’re on to the conference finals, we’re the biggest fucking underdog to me. Dude beat the 73 win Warriors after being down 3-1. No series lead is safe against this man."
"Lebron ""The only real playmaker"" James would disagree"
If that isnt LeBron james it's a charge
"1. The lebron/rondo minutes haven't been good in 2 seasons, Vogel has even admitted it, but says he won't stop doing it. 2. Vogel is in love with rondo 3. IDK why they don't just trap james and russ when one of the is on the bench.  4. Houston switches everything so that kinda affects your ability to run PNR properly.  5. Yea their bigs have to be more aggressive, also, they got beat out to a bunch of long boards, their energy was very poor."
"You can thank DeMar DeRozan who got completely torched by Kyle Korver (left wide open for practice triples due to DeMar's awful off-ball defense) and [George Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0q4z2I6UgY) (frequently beat DeMar off the dribble), as well as Coach of the Year Casey and his absolutely genius defensive scheme which included not doubling LeBron fucking James on the final possession of Game 3. No surprise, then, that both of them were gone by next season."
"Ty Lue was handed a golden ticket in Cleveland. David Blatt was using stale Euro/Russian league tactics and did not want Lebron to run his game. Please exclude him from that list, as the following 2 seasons, under his direct control, the Cavs managed 1 win in 9 games vs. The Warriors... other than that (though you could say the same about Spoelstra when Wade, James and Bosh were in town with Allen on the wing)"
The small market Lakers team lead by small market star Lebron James is so oppressed by the media.  I feel so bad for Laker fans.
"This is such a braindead argument when people say he didn't win without Pippen. Whats your point? That Jordan wouldn't have won his first playoff series if he didn't have Pippen coming off the bench averaging 8 ppg? Lol come on now, Jordan started winning as soon as he didn't have a shit team anymore. Simple as that. Its like saying ""Lebron as never won a single ring without James Jones on his roster"" which is just stupid."
“No superteams” - [LAL] LeBron James
my team was the opposite! who would win;   **PG: Chris Paul**  **SG: Michael Jordan**  **SF: Dennis Rodman**  **PF: Kevin Garnett**  **C: Ben Wallace**  ___  or your team?   **PG: Stephen Curry**  **SG: Klay Thompson**  **SF: Lebron James**  **PF: Dirk Nowitzki**  **C: Nikola Jokic?**  ___  i prefer my team tbh
"Starters: PG: LeBron James SG: Klay Thompson, SF: Scottie Pippen, PF: Dirk Nowitzki, C: Anthony Davis  Bench: Lonzo Ball, Devin Booker, Brandon Ingram, Robert Covington, Nikola Vucevic  Shooting + Defence   Championship favourites for sure"
Modern times.  Lebron James   Curry   Harden/Giannis      Anthony Davis   Jokic/Walker
"This depends greatly on how we adjust player skills for their era and if we're using peaks. I'm gonna make certain assumptions about adjustments, and use a single season peak, but I'd understand objections with that (I didn't bother the year for the bench players).   West 1966 - Miller 1994 - LBJ 2013 - KG 2004 - Walton 1977  Petrovic - Kirilenko - PJ Tucker - Kukoc - Arvydas Sabonis  I think you can make a reasonable argument for several of the players in tier 1, so I started with tiers 2 and 3.   KG (2004) - extremely portable player, one of the greatest defenders of all time, elite playmaker for a big  Jerry West (1966) - I was debating between West and Curry so I'd have an elite offensive guard, but West was significantly better defensively. People don't realize how good of a scorer Jerry West was. From 1963-64 to 1970-71, he posted rTS of +7.7, +9.3, +8,6, +6.6, +9.2, +6.6, +6.1, +7.7, and on decent volume (always hovering around 20-23 PTS/75. If we adjusted for era, I would personally give him near Curry level gravity - still not as good, but among the best of all time. This is all with elite guard defense.  Bill Walton (1977) - One of the greatest peaks for a center, behind only certain seasons of the tier 1 players (and David Robinson who wasn't included). Great defensively, really good passing season, solid rebounding. Just a great season.  Reggie Miller (1994) - I'm missing a guard and a small forward. Reggie Miller is the second best off-ball threat only to Curry in my opinion, was a great floor spacer, and would create a lot of opportunities for teammates with this.   LeBron James (2013) - At this point he was already an amazing passer, which would be great considering the movement from the guards and a bunch of plays that could be run with KG and Walton. He was also a great cutter, which would be great since he'll be paired with great passers. He was also a very good (and switchable) defender.  For the bench, I won't cheat with young players like Luka :)  Drazen Petrovic - great shooter, comes with a lot of good off ball movement, decent enough defender as a bench player  Arvydas Sabonis - original unicorn, big 7'3"" center who could find elite passes, space the floor, and was good inside  Tucker - switchable defender who can space the floor and set decent screens  Kukoc - would space the floor, provides value as a passer  Kirilenko - elite defender, provides some spacing (which I think would be increased in today's era), very efficient points, and good offensive rebounder"
PG: Steph Curry (tier 2)   SG: Klay Thompson (tier 3)   SF: LeBron James (tier 1)   PF: Kevin Garnett (tier 2)   C: Anthony Davis (tier 3)    Adios mutherfucker
"LeBron James III, Riley Currys son, and D Wades nephew win their first title on the same team after a historic season"
"No mechanical crap but I think maybe a 4 pointer, and we will see a lot of Lebron James caliber players b/c of increases in training method. Probably a 40 team league maybe an 8 team European division especially if planes go faster like a two hour trip from ny to London, arenas will probably super nice. 18 year olds can enter the draft. It’d be cool to see another league try to compete with the nba."
Hope he starts going by LeBron James Jr in 3 years
Winning an award for defending *LeBron James* is supposed to be a bad thing?? I'm confused.
&gt;Losing the maximum amount of games possible on your way to a championship is not impressive.  Yeah but beating a LeBron James led team will always be impressive imo
So my favorite player is lebron James. However I am biased and I think Jordan is a better player
"Haha I didn’t actually realize you were a Celtics fan too. Maybe your prediction was partly wishful thinking that someone would stand up to the unstoppable juggernaut that is the Lebron James Lakers, but I fear the worst."
Ty Lue has never won an NBA game without LeBron James 😂😂😂😂
&gt;There is no science or math that backs up your original claim re: KD vs LeBron on defense  Kevin Durant Defensive Rating past two seasons: 108  Lebron James Defensive Rating this season: 106
Lebron James being undefeated in his entire career when up 3-1 vs Nuggets at 1-3 this season.  Hmmm tough choice
Lebron james is the best basket ball player in the world.
The team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis
Bronny becomes the #1 pick regardless of him being the best in his class if LeBron chooses to sign wherever his son get drafted. Don’t think teams will choose to pass on a LeBron James BOGO deal.
one also plays with lebron freaking james
Kawhi Leonard isn't the best player on he planet. LeBron James is.
Lebron James didnt even make the playoffs last year
"Harden doesn't have the team around him he needs sure. But Curry is the better player and has been over this 5 year period. Despite averaging 10 points more in the regular season, you don't see that gap come post season with one exception. 2015 Curry outplayed him. 2016 Harden just slightly outplayed Klay! 2017 Harden wanted to hit the strip club so who knows. 2018 Steph played Harden about even, had better efficiency. 2019 Harden clearly outplays Steph, Steph bounces back in the next series against Portland.  Which tells you that the regular season numbers don't all the sudden make James the next MJ despite everyones sad attempt to anoint Harden the best offensive player alive. Do it consistently when its tough. Which I'm not saying Steph has done each and every time. But I know players that have many times. Acting like being a regular season scoring champ means jack shit is the first mistake. Having battled with both Harden and Lebron, I can tell you Lebron is somebody you fear. His teams have blown the roof off the building before when we faced them (2017 game 4). Lebron is a better offensive player than Harden and has been each and every year that the Harden hype has inflated. Steph has better help sure, but he's also a selfless player and accommodates his teammates skills better. Perhaps Steph fits next to a star better than Harden since he's not ball hungry."
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."
So you’re telling me that LeBron James can play for the Knicks in 3 years? Hmm....
All that and you forgot to mention Lebron James.
"Can we really say that when Jokic has made it to Game 7 of the second round as the primary option twice, but AD has only done once and needed Lebron James.  I'm straight up asking, because I agree with you in my gut...but being better at taking teams deep in the playoffs feels like ceiling raising to me.  While their type of talent definitely suggests you're right, the evidence on the floor seems to indicate the opposite - AD would get the Pels to the playoffs sometimes or make them competitive with a weak roster (high floor), but Jokic is man-handling championship favorites in the second round (high ceiling)."
"The obvious and truest choice is LeBron ""Assist leader"" James. Kawhi is top 5 for sure, but to definitively put him above LeBron seems silly. LeBron's team is higher seeded, won two series in 5 in a row, and he also happened to lead the league in assists this season."
"To add to this comment, in an interview with Chris Haynes, [he explicitly said that the behind the scenes stuff has nothing to do with the team and that they have 0 lack of team chemistry](https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1296174341445619713). Quinn Cook even wrote an article about the Lakers' chemistry with this bit, [""...with this Lakers team, it’s a real brotherhood.""](https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/nba-rumors-lakers-quinn-cook-la-los-angeles-lebron-james-anthony-davis-playoffs-chemistry-bubble-leadership)"
"He was ahead of Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard. Would you say that he’s better than any of those players?"
"Who won that talent show, you ask? Cindy Vortex and Libby Folfax. There is no coincidence that those names are anagrams for Anthony Davis and LeBron James."
Ya but we also have a Lebron James
"Imagine rejecting the opportunity to coach Lebron James and Anthony Davis on the Los Angeles Lakers because the offer was ""insulting"" at only 3/$18m."
I don't know why but the face of LeBron James smiling at Westbrook popped up in my head once I knew about the lost of Clippers.
In modern nba playmaking you have to be able to do everything as position less as it is. Most stars are literal systems. LeBron james Steph curry james harden kawhai and jokic all of them are the system which doed not apply  to Anthony davis as his  ball handling which is good but not great and his mediocre playmaking make it so he has to be a guy that sets you have to set up in the offense rather than the guy that sets up the offense
"Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and James Harden. I think he's on par with Luka Doncic and Damien Lillard just outside the top 5."
"Eh, there was a very slim chance it doesn't work. There was much better chance that adding arguably TOP 5 player in the league to fucking LeBron James will make Lakers win. The re-build also let Lakers build a team to suit LeBron's play more, add shooters etc."
Lebron sitting on the bench with his high school teammates during a suspension.   [http://media.cleveland.com/cavs\_impact/photo/lebron-james-on-bench-making-of-an-mvpjpg-3f6d7744609cab50\_large.jpg](http://media.cleveland.com/cavs_impact/photo/lebron-james-on-bench-making-of-an-mvpjpg-3f6d7744609cab50_large.jpg)
He's a guard who can't shoot well or play make exceptionally well. He's a good defender but that alone won't cut it on a team without LeBron James.
Thats fine I respect your opinion also dont tout 2 fmvp like kawhis first fmvp might be the weakest one beside Andre's. They just got the defended LeBron james award.
Depth is irrelevant when the other team has LeBron James and AD.
I think it’s safe to say the lakers have the best player in LeBron James. That dude completely elevates everything around him in an unbelievable way.
"The team isn’t particularly deep, they just have LeBron James to play with. They look clueless whenever he doesn’t play. You think most other teams are gonna get away with playing Alex fucking Caruso for 20 MPG?"
Breaking News: LeBron James is the best player in the world
yeah with LeBron James on his team
Westbrook came back from injury and had COVID before the bubble. saying we should trade him after one season is insane and we lost to fucking LeBron James dude
"No. If it takes more than two for Kawhi to pass LeBron, why would Joker get it in one?  I get people are hype. He was great today. But anyone who thinks Jokic is better than LeBron James is being silly IMO"
They are a good team but I gotta admit they arent experienced to take on LeBron. They're gonna get their ass whooped by daddy James.
"I don't like talking about the injured guys (KD, Steph, Kyrie and Klay), so this is my list without them:   1-Lebron James  2-Kawhi Leonard  3-Giannis Antetokounmpo  4-Anthony Davis  5-Luka Doncic  6-Nikola Jokic  7-James Harden  8-Jayson Tatum  9-Damian Lillard  10-Paul George"
"Well one thing's for sure, only one player on the court tonight deserves to be compared against LeBron James. And it ain't Kawhi."
"He's revolutionary in the regular season, yes. However, time and time again he lacks the ability to make good adjustments in the playoffs. He's run into Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, and the Warriors, which is unfortunate, but he's never reached a Finals once in his career. I think his playoff expertise is questionable."
"The fact that they ran into Warriors and Lebron James means that the only way they can get better is with more star power. Also Westbrook and Harden pairing is not ideal, Harden cannot work with a guy who cannot shoot to save his life."
Kinda bs imo. He's been pretty good. Sorry he couldn't beat the Steph Curry led Warriors and now the Lebron James led Lakers. No other coach would be able to make this happen.
i want to agree but this clippers team has been doing this shit all season long. they just don't show up certain nights or disappear as a group mid game. it's bizarre. the nuggets deserve a lot of credit too but i am not at all confident in this clippers team beating a team with LeBron james and anthony davis on it if they manage to win game 7.
the only guy that can say he was held to the same standards as lebron james is the guy with the crying and i pad memes. no one else
And what about LeBron James?
"I don’t believe that.   It’s recency bias for starters.   And for one - this sub isn’t one opinion, one day a player does bad and the haters come out. The next day he does good and the haters are silent while those who support the player or just enjoy watching great players perform great start talking. It’s not so black and white. And to top that off, people would rather see the bad in a single player or superstar rather than accept that the other team might just be very good. People would rather say “Russell Westbrook is shit” than realize that Lebron, AD and the Lakers are just a well oiled machine that clamped the Rockets. Neither Harden or Russ are bad. Anyone who thinks he’s not a good player is hating. Seriously, it’s Lebron James and the Lakers.   Same shit happened and Mark Cuban said it - Why is it that the losing team is always copped out with “they just didn’t want it,” or “they played bad” when the reality is the winning team executed perfectly what they needed to do to win rather than either being bad.   I will say he has one of the lower IQs of most superstars, but that doesn’t take away from his athleticism or how great of a player he is. He just has bad nights. But I don’t think he’s not HOF material.  He’s an MVP - his triple double season. Dudes a stud. Just needs to learn to play off the ball, hit his shots. That’s all it takes for him. He’s not bad tho."
Nah it's another team with a guy that goes by the name LeBron James
Monte Morris looks like a little lebron james lmao
"no you would not have to search far. he was literally one of the best coaches at after time out plays and made great adjustments in the playoffs, coaches knew it. read what griffin had to say about him  David Griffin: ""There's a really big disconnect between front offices and coaches. Ty Lue never got any love and respect from the front offices, and yet if you ask coaches which head coach makes the best in-game offensive adjustments , Ty Lue's name comes up very, very quickly.""  &gt;DG: There's a really big disconnect between front offices and coaches. Ty Lue never got any love and respect from the front offices, and yet if you ask coaches -- and I know this because I've seen this conversation take place among many coaches sitting together in Las Vegas -- if you ask coaches which head coach makes the best in-game offensive adjustments , Ty Lue's name comes up very, very quickly. But the front offices aren't revealing any of that because they're not in the war room every day with their coaches trying to draw plays to stop teams.   &gt;I remember vivdly, Dwane Casey looking down at Ty Lue in a second round game, coming out of a timeout and almost going zone half of the time because he's like ""you're not going to embarrass ME with one of those quick hitters after a timeout."" Ty's so good at it he's in coaches heads, but he gets no love whatsoever from the front office and I found that to be really, really interesting. And I think just as Steve Kerr is somewhat hamstrung by the greatness of his roster, Ty Lue was hamstrung by the greatness of Lebron James. I think the thing I'm most excited to see in the NBA is after this season, these questions about head coaches -- will Ty Lue start to get some of the respect he deserves?    https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9oop15/david_griffin_theres_a_really_big_disconnect/"
Why anybody thought/thinks any team had/has a chance against Anthony Davis and Lebron James is beyond me.
"Anything to make Lebron James' 8 consecutive finals runs to look easy.   The Celtics with the big 3 and in Tatum's rookie year, Bulls with Derrick Rose, PG's Pacers and in 2018, the Raptors, the Hawks, the 13-14 Nets weren't a terrible team and Doug Collins' sixers were not terrible either. They just ran into Lebron James. Those teams were good but Lebron James is no joke. Just because they lost to his teams doesn't mean that they were rebuilding."

LeBron James lmao
"Harden isn’t as good of a player as the last 4 FMVPs. Period. He’s at maximum effectiveness playing the way he does, all this criticism of Hardens play style ignores that it’s his teammates that are the problem. We will all see if Dantoni is gone, a less effective James Harden. I don’t like the play style. I don’t think it works in the playoffs. But pretending like this “generational” offensive player of Harden isn’t something being unlocked fully by Dantoni is an insult to him as a coach. The roster is constructed poorly. Dantoni needs a GM that tempers his worse instincts not feeds them. If they kept Chris Paul and Capella, they would have a chance. If they wanted to commit small ball hari Kari then they should’ve done so with CP3. The whole point of 5 small players was 3 point shooting. They had to lose Capela because of Westbrook. They screwed themselves. Harden deserves tons of criticism on his effort and on his wanting CP3 gone, but despite his several bad games, Harden played his best playoff ball in the bubble. Finally being a more efficient scorer. Just had a crappy team along side him. And I know Harden has some size and length, but he’s no kawhi, lebron or certainly no KD. So expecting him to just be “more like those wings” misunderstands him as a player. KOC pointing out what Harden could do at OKC as a bench player. Like Houston hasn’t gotten the most out of him vs his origin on the bench. If harden could carry a team alone he would’ve done it already. He needed a better costar and CP3 was the best he’s had and will have in his career."
based on what? not having LeBron James?
Nothing embarrassing about losing in the playoffs to Lebron James and Anthony Davis. Many many more will do the same in the coming years trust me ;)
"Kawhi Leonard or LeBron James would probably replicate that performance on that Warriors team, if not exceed it."
Wouldn't James Harden be on the LeBron roster?
"Not rooting for a team for a while has given me the clarity to realize just how much better a player LeBron James is than guys like James Harden and Russell Westbrook.  It’s like night and day.  I’m not sure how the Rockets can beat a team led by LeBron, besides recruiting a good defensive big man like Giannis Antetokounmpo.  They really need size and leadership.  This small ball shit doesn’t work against teams with a brain because it relies on scrambling defenses, and teams with good defenses are just going to guard man to man."
"Ahh yes, how dare someone lose to Lebron James"
"&gt;James Harden is the Peyton Manning of the NBA.  I'd say LeBron is that. Every team he goes to becomes a LeBron team going against great teams and coaches. Pop is his Belichick. The narrative is always the genius of LeBron against these crafty coaches with scrappy players (Bulls, Pacers, Celtics), and in the end the system wins enough to diminish LeBron to 2nd behind his Brady (Jordan, based on historical context)... Or more currently KD/Kawhi."
"I completely agree - to put LeBron and Ali in the same category as far as social justice is an indefensible take, completely unacceptable.  LeBron has been an *outstanding* voice for social justice and has contributed millions in resources and consistently spoken up in a way that puts him at the forefront of his generation in this regard. But he wears a Kap jersey for a reason - Kap made a legit sacrifice for the cause. He lost his career over it. Ali was arrested for his activism.   LeBron has incurred no personal sacrifice that meaningfully affects his quality of life and I do personally believe it is reasonable to ask him to consider forgoing an NBA championship (the pursuit of which he could return to as early as next year, unlike Kap, unlike Ali, unlike Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and a handful of other legends) in support of something much larger than himself, his career, or even the league as a whole.  On the other hand, of course LeBron, iconic though he may be, is still a human person. He has every right to be unwilling to make that sacrifice and/or he has the right to believe (potentially correctly so, though I do not believe this is the case) it is better for him to keep playing and leveraging the eyeballs that his play and his platform garner.   I imagine he's deadlocked on winning the finals and that the first words out of his mouth will pertain to social justice and BLM and that he - again, potentially correctly - views that this stage is the best way to get his message and goals actualized. I disagree, but it is legitimate.   All that to say - please don't compare LeBron James with Muhammad Ali or claim that it's a childish take given the absolute global frenzy and attention that would ensure if he literally shut down the NBA season singlehandedly (as he could very much do), elevating his cause and his legacy in doing so."
Lebron James: A lion doesn’t concern himself with the opinion of sheep
Lebron James
nothing fair and square about the lakers. see the fact that lebron james and ad decide to turn you into the best team in the nba despite being managed like a complete clusterfuck for the last decade just cuz its the lakers.
Leroy Jenkins has the same initials as LeBron James.  [Coincidence? I think not!](https://i.imgflip.com/4et5nx.jpg)
"do my ears deceive me? did Lebron James, who literally throws his hands up in disbelief every time he gets called for a foul, say “play ball”?"
LeBron James has spent more than half of his NBA career going to the finals
"LeBron James Kevin Durant James Harden Chris Paul Anthony Davis Kyle Lowry Jalen Brown Kemba Walker Jayson Tatum Giannis Antetokounpo Khris Middleton Jimmy Butler Kawhi Leonard Paul George Jamal Murray Nikola Jokic Stephen Curry Klay Thompson Draymond Green Luka Doncic Kristaps Porzingis Damian Lillard CJ Mccollum Devin Booker Ben Simmons Joel Embiid Donovan Mitchell Rudy Gobert Jrue Holiday Brandon Ingram Kyrie Irving Bradley Beal  John Wall Karl Anthony Towns Ja Morant Kevin Love Zion Williamson Nikola Vucevic Bam Adebayo Demar Derozan Zach Lavine  I'd easily take those players above Westbrook. Westbrook is raw talent but has poor basketball IQ. He can't make any adjustments because he only knows how to play one way. There's a reason the last time Westbrook shot above 50% in the playoffs besides game 4 was in 2016. All the players I mentioned above can adjust their game and are simply better pairings than Russell Westbrook. I felt bad for the Rockets because Harden should have had the ball every possession but because they couldn't figure out what to do with Russ, they just gave him the ball instead and had Harden stand around. Like I said, Westbrook is a top 20 player to me IF what you want is someone who can carry your team from the trenches and want to sell tickets. He's however, not a very good player from a championship building process. The fact that OKC became a better team without Russ shows just how replaceable Russ can be. The fact that the Rockets, with CP3, was a better version of these Rockets tells me enough. And the fact that Russ continues to play only one way is enough evidence for me to view him as a liability in the playoffs."
"I don’t think they are looking for LeBron James to literally step outside and join them, just to acknowledge the murder they are protesting."
"&gt; Kyrie still did really well with LeBron.  Any other point guard would have done well with LeBron. It's fucking LeBron James; one of the two greatest players in NBA history. Not saying that Kyrie didn't have important moments in their playoff runs, and especially their title run. But all of that worked well primarily because LeBron made it so.  LeBron was alpha enough to somehow force Kyrie to curb the off-court bullshit and just play ball. LeBron took all the attention and criticism, so that Kyrie could just focus on his game. Kyrie is an elite 2nd option, but he's a terrible first option.  But Kyrie is a veteran now, with a bigger platform and clout in the NBA. We'll see if KD can be what LeBron was to Kyrie. But if he isn't, I think the Nets experiment is doomed to fail."
Lebron fucking james as point and Anthony fucking Davis at 5 is small??? What???? It’s smaller ball than the lakers normally went with but how the fuck is that small
"Shit y'all were lucky it even went to 3-1, the way they define ""hostile act"" Dray would have been suspended the entire series after the 3rd or 4th dick kick. Multiple injuries? Everyone's banged up in the playoffs, it's a question of durability, will to win, and moreso will to not lose.  &amp;#x200B;  That team, spearheaded by LeBron James, did something that had NEVER been done before or since, and possibly ever again the way the planet is headed."
BREAKING NEWS : WEST TEAMS RELOCATE TO THE EASTERN CONFERENCE TO ESCAPE LEBRON JAMES
"Not at all. Protesting is fine, getting your message across is great. If they’re simply asking Lebron to use his platform for a case they care about I don’t see a problem there. Again, certain measures, though, have a counterproductive effect of turning people off to you and your message. I’m not talking protesting or taking a knee. I’m talking like those people getting in people’s faces demanding they raise their fist. I see this like that. Again, they threatened the bubble and Lebron has already demonstrated he is a willing and able listener.   What I see is people who attack their own because they’re angry. Anger is justified and ok but it makes no sense to go after the people who are with you. James and Westbrook aren’t the enemy."
"That's not what happened at all. He went for 8 finals runs because he's fucking LeBron James. Are you gonna say the west is going into rebuild mode if LeBron makes the Finals again this year? Celtics/Bulls/Raptors/Pacers/Hawks all built competitive rosters during LeBron's time in the east, but they just weren't good enough, which is completely different from the east rolling over and rebuilding for 8 years which you are saying. Then there were teams like the Wizards/Knicks/Pistons who were just straight up ran by bad front offices, but clearly made moves that were trying to compete instead of tanking so I don't think that counts either."
"It's because Chalmers called him a bitch. [No, really. Source](https://brobible.com/sports/article/mario-chalmers-lebron-james-bench-fight/)  This is my favorite Chalmers moment. UD cracking a smile because he knows the team's little brother almost died, but has balls of steel!"
"The kid from Akron, not Cleveland. There’re people from other cities even countries love LeBron James just as much as Cleveland’s. I remembered what Cleveland did to LeBron after 9-yrs boosting that trash Cavs and city’s economy. They love him with the condition: “give me a ring”. It’s not LeBron wanna be drafted by Cavs and surely he has never ever owed Cleveland anything"

"I say CJ McCollum, Lou Williams, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Devonte Graham in the sentence and you comment on Julius Randle? Excuse me, I should have doctored up my examples to benefit my point.  It’s also not well below league average. League average is influenced by 1) positions that shoot really high, like Cs 2) guys like Giannis and LeBron and James Harden who shoot ridiculous numbers. He’s above the median but not by a lot. 151st in about ~350 players.   Which goes back to my point. He’s not this insanely inefficient guy like so many people just endlessly want people to believe. He’s just not. He’s also not a very efficient scorer either. He shoots about as efficient as you’d expect a borderline all star to shoot with that many shots. Not good. Not bad. I’m tired of hearing the same garbage with this topic about how terrible he is or how great he is when it really, really doesn’t sit at either extreme."
"Father time has a lot of work, Brady, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ibrahimovic, Federer, Valentino Rossi, Lewis Hamilton, LeBron James, he needs help."
"Rosters are comprise of role players and stars. If you're in the West it's called western conference team roster, if you're in the East it's called Eastern Conference team rosters. In the West, if Lebron James ended up with a team like Spurs playing with Duncan, Parker, Kawhi, Manu with Gregg Popovich as the coach that would be a nightmare for the NBA not just in western conference, the same thing if Lebron would end up with Golden State Warriors with Curry, Draymond and Klay. Lebron will be far more dangerous in the West than in the East because Lebron has access to a far better team roster than in the east."
"We are talking about vs James in the finals. Nothing else. Curry carried the warriors in the playoffs until KD came. Then he played more off-ball and still had a huge impact. Don't get me wrong.   But pure finals performance, Curry never was close to LeBron. So the argument that only Kawhi's and Curry's teams challenged LeBron and warriors are back next year is not it imo. Without KD they ain't going to the finals or winning in at least 1 of these years, maybe even neither."
Western conference contain western conference team rosters. Eastern conference contain eastern conference team rosters. Western Conference has better rosters than in Eastern conference and Lebron James being in the West meant he has access to better team rosters than in the East. He could end up with a Team like Golden State Warriors or Spurs with Duncan because West has a better roster than in the East.
"perhaps you were trying to be respectful, but the 19-20 Clippers definitely fit that ""can't just put star players on the same roster.""  You know who breaks that rule, though? LeBron James. Be it Wade and Bosh, or Irving and Love, or Davis and former all-stars, LeBron James makes it work for deep runs every single (except last year lol) time"
I don’t think I could ever count out a team that has LeBron James with more than a second on the clock
"Paur Pierce tomorrow   ""Lebron james isn't even in the top 100....what?...nevermind why im wearing a diaper, im talking abotu lbj"""
I'm literally telling you Lebron james has the most game winning shots in NBA history. Like that's a fact. Look it up. You're incorrect on your statement.
Not surprising. I believe only Kareem and Karl Malone have played more total career minutes (regular season + playoffs) than Lebron James. It's outrageous he's doing what he's doing with so much mileage.
"Whoa whoa whoa whoa.   Lebron James is Lebron James and I'm not saying AD is far and away our best player. It will always be close, but AD has been coming through in the clutch for us and just been all around consistent and has been elite everywhere, including defense, which is why I'm giving him the edge."
You know it’s funny the way that the shot that Anthony Davis hit came about is very similar to a shot LeBron James hit in the 2015 Eastern Conference Semifinals. Because that play was designed for Kyrie Irving. And LeBron just said F it and (sadly) hit the game winner over Jimmy Butler which ultimately ended that iteration of the Chicago Bulls.
Skip: “LeBron James..is the LUCKIEST superstar EVER. EVER! I cannot BELIEVE that you: Shannon Sharpe! Put him in the same category as Michael.Jeffery.JORDAN”
LeBron “Europa” James
Only thing I can think is he expected to get screened but it was LeBron fucking James ofc hes looking for the ball not to screen your dumb ass
"""Are teammates *FED UP* with LeBron James??"""
LeBron James. He's been the NBA's main character for a while now.
Is Josh Hart better than LeBron James??
Bruh do you have any idea what it took for Jokic to get us here without a LeBron James? Just enjoy the win.
"They have Lebron James, they were always the main character."
AD out here bailing out lebron james!
"THE HOLY TRINITY: ANTHONY DAVIS, LEBRON JAMES AND ALEX CARUSO"
AD IS BETTER THAN LEBRON JAMES
AD IS BETTER THAN LEBRON JAMES
Like I said AD is better than lebron James
I wonder what the NBA wants to rig: Lebron James and the sexy ass gigantic Los Angeles market winning it all for the Mamba's legacy or Jamal Murray/Jokic to play Miami in the Finals.  Laker fanboys are back to their delusional selves
I feel like this is the game that crushes the nuggets. They've got their balls on the line and they're so close but the Lakers have Lebron James at the end of the game.
"Whatever the outcome of this game, LeBron James will be heavily criticized by Skip Bayless tomorrow on Undisputed."
Rough 4th quarter for Lebron James
didnt think id see a day when a bench scrub gets more star calls than lebron fucking james
PJ Dozier now has more FT attempts than LeBron James  But the refs tho
"Wow a charge called on Lebron James in the 4th quarter of a conference final, refs are gonna get struck by a lightning bolt from Mt. Olympus"
LOL lebron 'travel' james fucking shit sport I swear to god.
I smell a Lebron James game winner 👀
What have the Lakers ever done w/out someone named Kobe Bryant or Lebron James on their team looool. If we have Lebron on our team Lakers go back to not making the playoffs lol  Edit: This century
Announcer: Lebron James looking like Caruso out there!
"LeBron ""Caruso"" James!"
And that is why LeBron James is the best at lay ups in the NBA.
LeBron James looking like Caruso
"Lebron ""Alex ""Michael Jordan"" Caruso"" James"
Did lebron james just earn a Caruso comparison?  High praise
LeBron free trow james.. Mug refs
"Well the Miami guys are not scorers in the slightest outside of Butler really. Iguodala and Crowder cannot our the ball on the floor and do not post up with intention to score. They are defensive minded players at that size. With LeBron James, he is attacking full speed at his size and posting guys up."
"Javale Mcgee has a higher +/- than Lebron James, another reminder that that stat means nothing"
"How? I'm not sure what the DPS analogy is supposed to be for - position? Probably not. Then what? Basketball is a team game and even looking at individual skills, the ultimate measurement is how much (extra) wins you can get the team. That includes leadership, getting the team going, mental toughness, clutchness, on top of individual skill sets.   Allen Iversion did one of the biggest carry jobs of all time. KG with the ass wolves got to the conf finals. Hell even Jimmy has proven himself time and time again. What has AD done with the Pels?   Everyone knows regular season matters little when we talk about top 10, top 5 type of players, it's all about playoff results and their contribution to it. Has AD proven much by himself? However this current run is looking very solid alongside Bron and even as a No.2 he's proving a lot as a top player in the playoffs.   He's top 5 for sure ""right now"" if we remove the injured players. Otherwise, are you taking him over: Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Lebron James? Then you are in a debatable range with Harden, Kawhi, Giannis, and Luka (maybe add Jokic now too?) I know with the playoffs losts all of them look worse, but they are all their team's No.1 / leader. AD is doing great along with Lebron but would you really have him over all of the listed as the team's No.1 option? I'm not asking it in a way like it's impossible, I'm simply saying it's close. Top 5 is definitely not a lock."
Except they arent coming back from this team. Lakers have LeBron freaking James to keep them away from striking distance.
The Warriors blew a 3-1 lead to Lebron James (second greatest player ever) and Kyrie Irving. The Clippers blew one to Jamal Murray and Jokic. Clippers collapsed against a way worse team
"LeBron James never raised his hand to his sons, because they seen him block."
"Of course it was 2012. That was the same year where Lebron just started ruling the east and no one was allowed to enter the finals if you don't have a Lebron James in your team. But during 2013-2018 there were good teams too. Like the 60 wins hawks. The Pacers. And the best team in the east(until they face a lebron) raptors. Even the young celtics. Or the one year ""superteam"" nets. But nothing actually mattered because it was all just Bron. And that was the time analysts started talking the east is weak because they kept on seeing one man go to the finals every year like it's a regular season game."
"Brook Lopez, Blake Griffin, Jason Kidd, Lebron James, Serge Ibaka, the Gasols, Channing Frye, among others."
Imagine complaining about officiating with Lebron James on your team
"LeBron James at the half: 20 points (8-11 FG, 3-4 from 3PT, 1-1 FT), 4 REB, 1 AST, 1 BLK, 2 TO. -5 +/-."

Utah has been the but of the NBA for a long time and gets zero respect so again I will take it. I sure hope that they find a way to get past the lakers. How much money does a title cost? + I fucking hate LeBron James with a PASSION. They're constantly in his nuts regardless of what he does, and sports center? FORGET IT!!! Anyway I am a Denver fan for sure right now and what's looking like a Heat fan if they lose. I hate the whiney balding (AGAIN) BITCH. I don't understand why everyone always has him in the topic!!?? GRRRRRRRR, IT SUCKS. EFF23!"
How do I get a Lebron James flair?
You guys are NUTS if any of the remaining teams are beating LeBron James *and* Anthony Davis 4 times
"Steph, Kawhi, Lebron, Giannis, James, all of these guys are a tier above the rest, and that’s not even factoring in KD who before his injury was easily top 5."
"Its 2 prong. Gets the series in line, and makes the eastern finals avoid monday night football especially when they are already struggling with viewership.   The west has the lakers (La is a basketball city) and lebron james. It will be finez"
Would love it but it's not enough plus Pels become the New Orleans Lakers and we become the Los Angeles Pelicans featuring LeBron James
"Idk about that. Would probably need LeBron to retire tbh. Don’t see you guys having Davis on the Supermax, James’ $41M option, *and* a max tor Kawhi, all while trying to field a championship team of guys on minimum deals because there’s no more money."
"I literally was playing Warzone with a buddy last night talking about the games and unironically called LeBron ""Queen James."" Naturally, I told him to put some respeck on LeBron's name, but he just replies with ""I just don't want him to win anymore. The more he wins, the more people will think he's the GOAT when I don't want him to be.""  So there ya go. Some people just hate LeBron because it's an attack on MJ.  Also, my buddy and I are Dubs fans, and my buddy is also a Niners fan, so whenever his teams lose, he forever hates the players who beat his team. Naturally, the person he hates the most in the NFL is Mahomes."
"Worst summer to be a LeBron fan celebrating him winning a championship   And then to not even realize until later with hindsight that Kyrie was buddy buddy that whole summer with the GS trio (minus Curry) during the Olympics run   We (LeBron) went at them the best they could in 2017 and it wasn’t even close to enough despite and All Time offensive showing and then Kyrie dips because he didn’t like being the #2  Those 3 years after KD announced his decision were the worst as a basketball fan in his early 20s who grew up idolizing LeBron James   Bro, fuck that signing omg I can’t believe LeBron is barely winning another ring he’s been on some GOAT shit for a while but has little to show for it despite epic postseason runs"
"Sometimes I'll be in, like, another team's game thread, and everyone will be all, like, talking about the 2 teams playing the game, and not the Lakers, and it is sooo annoying. It really ruffles my jimmies when I scroll past 3 or 4 comments and *none* of them are about the Lakers. Like *hello* we have *LeBron James* and *Anthony Davis* c'mon people I don't want to hear ""Boston this"" or ""Miami that"" when the LAKERS are out there existing somewhere"
"“ He’s(Dudley’s son) a part of what the Lakers are doing in Florida because the Lakers make him feel that way. After beating Houston in the second round, James walked off the court pointing at Juju(Dudley’s Son), who replied by saying “nice game LeBron.””  -  ""Easily the world’s greatest basketball camp — with the world’s greatest coaches and players,” Jared Dudley said. “He’s played 1-on-1 with AD and LeBron. He’s doing ballhandling drills with Phil Handy. That’s why, once my wife left, I decided to keep him here. I don’t know how many years I’ve got left playing, and I want him to remember this."""
LeBron James  also need to get that pasta and headlines by monday
Two words: Lebron James
"??? You mean ""I'll play LeBron James"" isn't a genius coaching style?"
"We get it, you are sexually attracted to Lebron James to the point you cant understand what anyones talking about lol. I never said *shit* about 'dominance' you added that in your head because you want Lebron to dominate your bootyhole. Theres nothing wrong with that. But an NFL running back whos overcome multiple back and knee surgeries to play in more games than any running back on history is more impressive from a longevity standpoint than any basketball player could ever hope to match unless they played literally into their 50s. Hell, MJ won an MVP, 72 games and a title at the same age Lebron is now, without being alongside another top 5ish player in the league. How is Lebrons longevity the most impressive overall when its not even #1 in his own sport? That being said, i do enjoy watching Lebron ball, so please dont stalk him and kill him for not answering your letters, pathetic ass stan."
"AD should've done a Game of Zones: ""Lebron James definitely deserved MVP over Giannis...that being saiiid...one could argue he's not even the best player on the team"""
"It's disgusting to think about how much food those NFL lineman eat. Nick Hardward was the Chargers center for many years. After he retired he lost 85 pounds in six months just by not force feeding himself anymore.  &gt; During his 4:45 a.m. drive to the Chargers’ facility, he consumed a 600-calorie protein shake and a bar that packed 20 grams of protein. After working out he grabbed a 300-calorie Gatorade protein shake. After showering he hit up the cafeteria to get a large smoothie “with everything imaginable in it”—plus five eggs, sausage, and 32 ounces of whole milk. He would snack on a bag of mixed nuts while watching film. Two or three hours into meetings, he’d down a 700-calorie protein shake. After practice, another protein shake. Lunch in the cafeteria meant a big salad, with as much protein as possible piled on top.  &gt; After even more meetings, Hardwick would go home and eat with his wife, Jayme. Dinner was always a normal meal—meat, potatoes, and vegetables—with normal portion sizes. “I didn’t want to drag my wife down with me,” he says. But 90 minutes later the heavy eating resumed. Hardwick would eat cereal poured over a 32-ounce tub of Greek yogurt, the size most people buy to last an entire week.  &gt; The nightcap: a pint of Ben of Jerry’s, savored while lying in bed. Karamel Sutra was his favorite, with 1,040 calories, 104 grams of sugar, and plenty of other unsightly numbers that led to even more unsightly numbers on the scale.  &gt; https://www.si.com/nfl/2015/06/02/nfl-nick-hardwick-weight-loss-san-diego-chargers  I have to think there's some degree of forced eating in the NBA, too, for the bigger guys. In the summer between going from Miami to Cleveland, LeBron gave up carbs, sugar and dairy and [noticeably slimmed down](https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2014823/rs_600x600-140923095628-600-lebron-james-skinny.ls.92214.jpg)."
"Instead on MJ, lebron or curry (the obvious answers) I’m gonna say James harden. James can shoot, get Shaq the ball, and be the primary ball handler"

Obviously LeBron James.
LeBron James
He almost weighs as much as boban whose like a foot taller then him.  He has some extra weight on him but hes built like a freaking running back. He needs to change his body and lose some unnecessary muscle  Lebron james at one time had that running back physique. Hes transformed his body and lost a lot of muscle. He has just enough to still boss ppl.
"Im well aware of these matches , I’m an MMA fan, have been well before the UFC became established as well.  Royce Gracie is a legend, HOF, and an all time great. Colby is good. He’s not that yet.   And Lebron james isn’t just bigger, he’s a lot stronger and he’s a professional trained athlete in significantly better health than a guy with even minimal training.  You give him an entire camp like fighters get today, train him on some takedown defense and you get him seriously engaged in training, I don’t see what Colby could do beside try and win it through the judges by getting him down and keeping him down... which would be hard because of the size difference.  Then you add the factor of the size and length difference , if he catches him once that could be it.   Like if he says like a regularly built basketball player or even MJ in his prime Im not questioning it... but Lebron is built like an NFL TE and is nearly a foot taller I think"
"I honestly think the Lakers are one of the only teams Howard could play decently well for. I think he really enjoys that LeBron James super positivity stuff. I think if you put him on a high strung/ stressed out team like the Clippers, Celtics or Heat (for example), he wouldnt be able to handle it."
Ok? I know a bunch of random Toronto people who “call out” LeBron James as well. Not exactly earth shattering news.
He called out lebron James yesterday and then got a phone call from the president
"Being a LeBron James fan, I always see a lot of people making shit takes and claims about him. You know I want people to enjoy the things they have. But sometimes I wish I could revoke their speaking rights about the game. Sheesh, their takes suck"
He did some great stuff but the lakers basically tanked for a good without any real contender potential just to get lebron James and trade basically every asset to get AD which only the lakers could to since he forced a trade and wouldn't resign anywhere else
"google ""is being overweight bad for you"" and it's pretty straightforward. he's an athlete. plenty of athletes have been overweight, no one but Shaq became an all time great that way. I bet LeBron would have dominated the paint at 300 pounds at 6'9"", but he was better off as a player being lighter. would you rather be Charles Barkley or LeBron James? some guys are content being Chuck, but if I'm Zion, I'm aiming for the top and that requires longevity and a health first focus."
Exactly. His name is literally LeBron James jr. Unfortunately he’s not just another teenager.
"He is an amazing shape, this is such a dumb nephew take he played 65 minutes  vs Portland last season. Also a decent defender and has become much better since joining the league but it’s Anthony davis and lebron James"
"Lebron James - 35,8/13,3/8,8 Curry - 26/5.2/6,3  Lebron TS% - 47,7 Curry TS% - 58,5  And Curry wasn't double teamed? This is Curry shooting % per game : Game 1 - 59,7% Game 2 - 35,8% Game 3 - 67,5% Game 4 - 47,1% Game 5 - 56,5% Game 6 - 55,5  Please explained to me how Lebron outplayed everyone when his shooting % were worst than Westbrook's? Just because GSW were giving jumpshots and were okay with him scoring doesn't mean he was the best in the series"
"To be fair, his reasoning was perfectly legitimate. You may disagree on what criteria he uses for selecting an MVP, but there's no objective definition of that. And within his limits, Melo was a perfectly fine choice.  Melo carried the Knicks to the first division win in 19 years and to the conference semis that season, the only time in 21 years the Knicks have gotten out of the first round of the playoffs. Obviously, that's not a part of the actual MVP voting, but it certainly shows how important Melo was *to the Knicks*.  Here's his actual reasoning:  &gt;If you were to take Anthony off the Knicks, they are a lottery team. James plays with two other All-Stars, the league’s all-time 3-point leader, a defensive stalwart, and a fearless point guard. The Heat are loaded.  &gt;If LeBron was taken away from the Heat, they still would be a fifth or sixth seed. He is the best player of this generation, a multifaceted superstar with the physical prowess of Adonis, but I chose to reward a player who has lifted his team to new heights.  He's not wrong about any of that."
He could be 5'5 and still get drafted. He's the son of LeBron James. There will be atleast 1 team drafting him just for publicity ( and a chance of LeBron coming)
"“ He’s(Dudley’s son) a part of what the Lakers are doing in Florida because the Lakers make him feel that way. After beating Houston in the second round, James walked off the court pointing at Juju(Dudley’s Son), who replied by saying “nice game LeBron.””"
"I don't need real world experience to understand that LeBron James condeming a fight for social justice on the other side of the globe (because it hurts his wallet), while actively participating and profiting on a fight for social justice on this side of the globe is hypocrisy.  I just need the ability to read, an understanding of the definition of hypocrisy, and LeBron's dick out of my mouth."
"&gt;LeBron James tells China “stop it”  &gt;China stops  &gt;world peace ensues   Brilliant, another college kid with 0 real world experience telling everyone his opinion"
"LeBron James is a black American man. He feels like his fight is for black American men. I won’t go so far as to say I agree with his politics (I don’t) but to go around acting like he’s some sort of Chinese super agent is patently false. He realizes that China is a communist country run by a STRONG communist party that quells dissent and rebellion quickly and violently. LeBron James saying some words in the media isn’t going to do a goddamn thing for the people of HK and China.   It’s not like here.   Dude, I’ve BEEN to China. I’ve been to most of Europe, ton of Asia, and some Middle East.   China just FEELS like a place you can’t fuck around in. And that’s me saying that having been to Saudi fucking Arabia."
"And Marresse Speights had the highest usage rating on the 2015 warriors. Higher than Steph, Klay and Draymond. Usage rate isn't the end all be all. I think if you actually acknowledged my point its clear to see that Robinson and George Hill and Seth Curry are a different class of player. One is a starter and a consistent 30 minutes a game guy. The other two are bench guys who are sometimes liable to rack up sub 20 minutes games.  Robinson not being allowed to dribble does not preclude him from being a low usage scorer. Where did I say that? Did you read what I said? I said it precludes him from the conversation of rim finishing statistics among guards and forwards who are driving to rim finish. Tyson Chandler had the highest rim percentage in the league a few times, did that mean he was a better rim finisher than Lebron James? No. But if you wanna go ahead and *only* cite Robinson's rim pct as proof he is as good a rim finisher as George Hill or Seth Curry, go right ahead.  And Robinson has a 61.4 efg%, Seth curry %62.8 and George Hill %63.8. Don't cherry pick stats. If you look at them in whole, its a wash. All three are equally efficient. Theres no comprehensive statistic based approach that gives one the clear edge.  &gt;It’s silly that your argument for Seth Curry being potentially the best low usage scorer is that he could do things that you think would allow him to be higher usage.  That's not my argument. The only reason you keep touting it as such is so you dont have to actually acknowledge what Ive been saying. My whole argument hinges on the fact that if you suddenly made Curry a high usage guy, he would not be as efficient. My argument is that in his 20 or so minutes a night, he's a better scorer than those two. Hes as efficient while doing everything the other two can and more.  &gt;this is Curry’s age 29 season and it’s the first one that is worth mentioning.  You keep revealing yourself to have never watched nor know anything about Curry's game. In 2017, Seth put up comparable stats to this year and actually led the Mavs in win shares with 4.6. I would caution you to make definitive arguments on guys you know nothing about."
"AhhI see this is the first LeBron team change you've witnessed. Yes, he does this to players. Basically, Kuzma has to play around James, so does everyone else. Also, coaching change. Walton used Kuzma very well. Vogel doesn't have to because he's got Davis in that same role. He's still getting 12 points a night and one scrimmage he started 5/5 and maybe 6/6 but definitely 4/4 from the 3pt line."
Kyrie has had peak Lebron fucking James for  like half of his career. Trae has had John Collins who has missed 20+ games 2 years in a row now

"What kind of idiot would think like that? It’s Lebron James. By being Lebron James, it’s automatically his team. No ifs or buts about it. Absolute moron."
30 year NBA veteran Lebron James
"&gt;I never said that. You're one of the lowest iq convos I've had online, congrats.  I’m not the one who insinuated that LeBron and AD were putting up empty stats in the playoffs  &gt; And where is the matchup problem with Steph,Klay,Iggy,Dray,Javale? Bingo, there is none  The matchup problem is LeBron James and AD hunting matchups against Steph, Klay, and JaVale McGee.  &gt;The Warriors would beat the Lakers because they were the best team in history, the Lakers are not.  I agree"
"You’re just a Lakers hater lmfao. We’re the #1 team in the West, were on pace to win 65 games, and have LeBron James and Anthony Davis. We’re not getting blown out and losing badly lmfao.  Even LeBron and a bunch of bums managed to nearly take a game off the Warriors"
"I think the Cavs and Lakers were both paying him not to coach in 2015 and then the Cavs started paying him to coach for the Warriors the next year. Then the Cavs had the season when they were paying Mike Brown, David Blatt, Tyronn Lue, and LeBron James to coach them.  [Have to give Mike Brown credit. Guy turned writing a letter asking fellow San Diego alum Bernie Bickerstaff for an internship into a long long NBA coaching career](https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2013/10/20_years_ago_cleveland_cavalie.html)"
"In the 18-19 season, LeBron James didn't even make the play offs after finally leaving the weak east. Proving that in fact he can not carry a weak team to the playoffs without another superstar. ""it's been activated"" - LeBron Feb 20th 2019, (in reference to intensity level needed to reach the playoffs, didn't work)"
LeHorse James is also in my bio. I should admit to thinking LeBron is a horse
Big true. They should just be honest and change the headline to LeBron James Helping Florida Ex-Felons Pay Fees So They Can Vote democrat
"You’re not arguing against a single thing I stated. I’m calling out your dumbass statement that Jason Terry held Lebron James to 8 points, and not the fantastic defense of the Mavs as a whole. Pure, idiotic hyberbole."
"Manu Ginobili has quite literally been in his prime for almost all of his career.  &gt;No one is in their prime for their entire career unless maybe Lebron James  What makes lebron the gold standard? People been career long prime players for decades. Larry Bird, Magic, Wilt, Kareem, MJ, Kobe, KD, etc. Cmon now."
No one is in their prime for their entire career unless maybe Lebron James
Okay but have you even considered LeBron James?
"He is also elite at penetrating and finding open shooters. Similar to how Lebron is able to drive, cause defenses to collapse, and find an open 3.   I agree that he should be used as the screener more often (though if you watched him play in January he was adding that element to his offense). But saying that he shouldnt be initiating the offense ignores how hes led the team to back to back 50 win seasons doing so and is like 5th in the league in assists.   Calling him Draymond comes off as disrespectful and ignores aspects of his game that he is elite at (and this is coming from someone who actually doesnt hate Dray).  To further put it into perspective Simmons is one of 3 players to reach 3500 points, 1700 assists, 1700 rebounds, and 350 steals before turning 24. The other two are Lebron James and Magic Johnson...  In January this year Simmons averaged 22.2/9.4/7.7/2.3  Those numbers are fucking absurd and if anyone was putting them up besides Ben Simmons he would be getting national recognition."
"You want to add Ali to the conversation? Great, that is why I said ""you could argue that"". I don't know much about Ali career but I know enough to know he has a good shot at the title.  &gt; yeah I don't really see the point you are arguing here. the first sentence makes no sense at all from a logical standpoint because you stated that he might not be the goat basketball player but he is the goat athlete somehow,  Because I am adding a lot of variables that are not exclusive to basketball, things all athletes have in common regardless of the sport. I can't compare Tiger Wood to Lebron James in terms of shooting threes right? But I can compare them in expectations, as an example. Both child prodigies had a lot of expectations coming into their professional careers and both pretty much exceeded them by a long shot.  Lebron is most charismatic than Jordan, he has had less controversies, movie worthy narrative (kid from Akron wins in Cleveland) and again in things Jordan wins (money, fame, etc) Lebron isn't so far behind.  &gt; ""health"" as an argument doesn't make sense when you consider all sports because something like curling is much less physically demanding than like mixed martial arts.  When it comes to health you compare between the sport. Jordan had a relative healthy career but he did have a major injury his second season. Lebron before last season never had a major injury and he played all these years with a freak body.  Again this is a subjective title and bound for a lot of arguments. You already made a good one."
Magic Johnson is a poor man’s LeBron James

Deadass? Ur also probably gonna tell me that Lebron James and the Great Kendrick Perkins were once AAU teammates as well 🤨
"Which is weird. It’s newer fans who didn’t watch him just three or four years ago that underrate him.   He used to be consensus top 3 passer in terms of creativity, IQ and vision in the league with only Lebron James &amp; CP3 ahead of him.   It’s wild that it only takes a couple of years for ppl to forget."
"“He’s all right, no left. #2 is all right.” - Lebron James, probably"
He’s really turned Lebron James into a superstar
"&gt;Oh come on man... it's fucking Kyle Kuzma he doesn't make the Lakers unbeatable even if he is hitting 3s.  While this is true, I think the point of that comment is that opposing defenses don't want to have to worry about other Lakers players going off in a game when you already have your plate full with LeBron James and Anthony Davis lol"
"I mean the last couple of years, harden has done better in the playoffs and had more success than everyone except those who a)played for Golden state or b) is named Lebron James or Kawhi Leonard. Like if James Harden is a playoff issue, then 99.5% of the league is one as well"
"I don’t think anybody is beating this team. Too loaded, too big, shooters on deck, LeBron James, Anthony Davis.... it’s over"

Lots of good rotations bigs being around prevents Lopez, Adebayo, and Sabonis from making it."
"I am not a fan of Lebron James, but this made me like him a lot more."
I look to lebron james to form my political opinions like any enlightened man would /s
"The GOAT case I prefer is that LeBron James has always won by the skin of his teeth (7 games vs Celtics in 2012, 7 games vs Paul george pacers LMAO and ray allen bailout 7 games vs spurs 2013, and 7 games vs warriors 2016 with draymond suspension).  Not only does Jordan have more titles but his titles are higher quality and he won several of them without needing any game 7s."
"Well no... Being the best at something doesn’t stop you being that thing.  By your apparent logic, LeBron James = HOFer and Tracy McGrady = HOFer therefore LeBron James = Tracy McGrady. Larry Bird = best player on a title team and Ben Wallace = best player on a title team so Larry Bird = Ben Wallace.  There’s levels to this shit. Ariza and co. are 3&amp;D. Klay is 3&amp;D, and also much better than them. They’re not conflicting ideas at all."
" This is my metric for (NBA) superstar -- do you have a chance to win a championship just because we got you?"" ESPN's Bomani Jones said Thursday on ""The Right Time with Bomani Jones"" podcast. ""We'll work the rest out, but if the first thing you tell me is that this guy plays for us, then we got a chance to do this...[with Steph] to have the chance you have to put this fairly specific set of things around him. And he can't guard nobody.If you tell me that you have Kevin Durant, you have a chance to win the championship. If you tell me you have Kawhi Leonard, my immediate response is, 'You have a chance to win a championship.' And the same with LeBron [James and Giannis Antetokounmpo]. You tell me you got Steph -- I want you to tell me a little bit more.  Pretty easy to deduce he does not see Steph as a superstar."
I have been telling people for years that the humidity in Orlando in the summer is no joke.  It takes Lebron James icing his balls in front of a live camera for people to understand what I mean.
This post has to do with Kyrie being a great second option. He was a great second option to LeBron and we would see how Cleveland would be without Kyrie then with him. LeBron James himself felt happy with Kyrie as a second option
"He's got a 36.1 career 3PT percentage.   LeBron James has a 34.4.  Now I'm not saying JV is better than LeBron, but I'm not not saying it either."
"More context, Bomani’s full original quote:  &gt; If you tell me that you have Kevin Durant, you have a chance to win the championship. If you tell me you have Kawhi Leonard, my immediate response is, 'You have a chance to win a championship.' And the same with LeBron [James and Giannis Antetokounmpo]. You tell me you got Steph -- I want you to tell me a little bit more ... my only problem with Steph though -- this is a big problem -- getting his own shot. He can get his own shot if he shoots it from 40 (feet).   &gt; ""He's got sick handle and all that stuff. There's something different. It's hard to explain what it is with Steph, but Steph is somehow like the greatest system player of all time. And I'm not saying that to shade him. But you are not going 1-4 flat and being like, 'Get us a bucket.' ""  He then says he can’t score in iso like Kyrie or Dame and scores off “trickeration”  On JJ’s pod, Bomani brings up that game 7 shot as his evidence. JJ’s response: “What if that shot against Kevin Love went in? We've seen him make that shot hundreds of times. You're talking about 1 possession, 1 shot, as your evidence for he cant get his own shot"""

Was that grey in LeBron James' beard in that promo?
"LeBron James cried when he got called a bitch, so pretty fucking weak."
"Dude you're totally right, I can't believe people are giving him a shout out for shooting 100% in a game against scrubs like Lebron James and Anthony Davis. All these threads on r/NBA right now showing highlights from scrimmage games but this is the one that offends you lol."
That’s what sucks. Both Mike and LeBron James have had seasons where this should’ve been the case. Gasol didn’t even make first team all defense in 2013  that makes 0 sense 🤦‍♂️  Edit: my bad. MJ did this. Point stands for LeBron tho.
Just once I’d like a coach or GM to say that an opposing player deserves MVP. That would be truly surprising   Like coach Bud saying: Giannis has had a good year and everything but the real MVP is LeBron James.
"He's gonna win MVP over the relatively smaller (but still physically imposing) LeBron ""Hatzegopteryx"" James because of his superior height and length"
"&gt;You really think someone like King James is sleeping in the same type of room that Alex Caruso is?   No, I don't think he is because I think we already have proof that the stars are staying in nicer rooms. I think Dame is in a presidential suite, so I imagine LeBron is in something similar  Edit: Also, I'm pretty sure the tunnels at Disney are only under the parks, not the hotels"
Lebron James Returns to Cleveland to “Win those fuckers another ring “  Edit: I thought it said resigned
Yea I watch games all the time. Steve Nash was not more impactful than Lebron fucking James lmao. And Lebrons supporting cast was still dog shit compared to Nash’s even with those injuries.  Also Steve Nash was a garbage defender did you even realize that?
Inb4 delonte and LeBron james
"i always thought morris was a solid defender, but i have no idea what the advanced stats say.  i *do* recall some article that touted his defensive numbers vs lebron  EDIT: [here's](https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2017/07/08/heres-one-reason-celtics-fans-should-be-excited-about-marcus-morris) the article, and it [looks like he did a solid job](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2018/05/16/marcus-morris-remains-celtics-best-defender-vs-lebron-james/) on lebron during the 2018 playoffs.  of course, i should add the caveat that a player's defensive performance against a singular player shouldn't be used as a basis for gauging their overall defensive prowess."
"&gt; So Nash wasn't the best player in the league but even without stoudemire proved to be one of the most impactful. And that what MVP is about. People who never watched nba at times can't understand what incredible step Suns made the moment they signed Nash.  Lol you're telling me Steve Nash had more impact on the game than lebron James? Lebron who was an elite playmaker, passer, as well as being an elite scorer."
“Hello Po-lice? Lebron James is trying to beat me up”
"Do you think James Harden would EVER miss the playoffs? Would Kawhi or Steph or LeBron or KD? Being a real superstar in the league means you either make the guys around you better so that the team makes the playoffs, or you drag them there no matter what. Anything else means you're just not good enough."
He's a playmaker. And he's also LeBron James. Total package.
"&gt;	As it turns out, Jordan gave the OK to use the footage on the same day that LeBron and the Cleveland Cavaliers were celebrating their 2016 championship with a parade through the streets of Cleveland.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/michael-jordan-agreed-to-the-last-dance-documentary-thanks-to-lebron-james-allen-iverson-adam-silver/  Not misleading at all. Definitely not a reach. It was talked about a lot once the documentary was set to air.   But I wouldn’t expect someone who has said “LeBron isn’t on Jordan’s level” to agree, you’re mind and bias has already been established."
"Again, there's a big difference between me and LeBron freaking James. Him and I are not even in the same world when it comes to fame or wealth. He COULD'VE said nothing at all, but he chose to support China over people fighting for their freedom. He has the audience and money to never worry about his financial status again. It would've been more easy for him to speak out against China than me, who's trying to save up for a buying a damn house, paying off student loans, and paying off my car.  If you want to criticize me, go right ahead. I literally don't care. Hell, regarding China, I'm more of an activist for spreading the news of their atrocities than LeBron himself."
"You have no idea what I've done for my ""version of activism"".  Also I'm not 100% sure, but I think LeBron James has a slightly better platform for activism than me."
"To quote Lebron James,  ""Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others, and you're only thinking about yourself.

"I am genuinely impressed with this statement from Lebron James. He seems sincere and unrehearsed. And heck, he is buff!"
1 pro fight though right? First one against Deji he had head gear? I don’t really care tho I mean Nate is an athlete. He’s not just some guy who made a pro team once. He was good in the nba for many years and at one point demanded Lebron James to guard him
#Fuck China  Good on the nba. Fuck Lebron Mao James
"*James had a monstrous series, but finished shooting under 30 percent from the field and was held to a minus net-rating when on the floor -- largely thanks to Iguodala. Overall, James despite averaging 35.8/13.3/8.8 shot just 38.1% when defended by Iguodala.*  Obviously Iguodala got the benefit of the FMVP almost always being given to a player from the winning team considering James' disgusting averages, but let's not act like like Iguodala is a poor defender. Was there anyone else better at defending vs LeBron that series? Nope."

"Cue LeBron James saying that the NBA is misinformed and miseducated and that the concentration camps the Uyghurs are behind held in are just ""vocational centers."""
wow I wonder what Lebron James has to say about that!
LeBron going full old man James.
"It's a stupid reasoning to disqualify a player based on number of games played, especially if that player is above heads and shoulders of everyone else. It doesn't matter if he played fewer games than Morant. He's clearly the best player  in this rookie class. There's not even a legal rule specifying a minimum games required to win that award. It's just an unspoken rule. Imagine giving the award to Carmelo Anthony just because Lebron James missed a lot of games. idc wtf you say. The award should go to the best rookie. PERIOD.  In the same vein, why shouldn't AD be DPOY? He anchors the 2nd best defense in the league and he's had to do it with lesser defensive capable team mates. The Bucks are number 1, but Giannis has the help of better defenders in Middleton and Bledsoe. In fact, Middleton takes the toughest assignment always. Giannis has the narrative going, but the metrics give it to AD."

"Marcus Smart is 27th in the league in terms of 3PA with nearly 7 a game, with 3pt shooting on par with the likes of LeBron James, James Harden, and Robert Covington in terms of percentages.   Smart is a below average finisher with his wild ass floaters but he's a legit 3pt shooter.  He's just not that good at scoring nearly anywhere else in the court lol."

Really impressive for a player who is in his 17th season in the League.  LeBron James has been able to constantly reinvent himself since he arrived in the League and that explains why he is still on top after so many minutes in NBA.
That LeBron James was gonna be good.

"Thanks commissioner, since I live in hong kong had to wake up at 3am to catch a scrimmage.  Its 4PM now and I am super sleepy.  The nba the Lebron James doesn't care about Jong Kong!"
"The thing about Wilt is that he was actually extremely skilled AND a ridiculous athlete, we just don't have the footage for people to see. Also, Wilt's sheer absurd averages warrants him a place among the best.  There are five ways to score (layup/dunk, FT, mid range, 3-PT and post), four of which were focused for the entire history of the game up until the 2010s. For example, Michael is the GOAT scorer, he was elite in 4 out of 5 and average in the 5th one, so is KD and so was Kobe. For me, unless you are a big man, to qualify with Michael/KD/Kobe as a scorer, you need to meet this criteria, but obviously it's all subjective.  LeBron for me, as an example, while he is godly as a finisher in the basket, i would say he is an average mid range scorer, 3-PT shooter, post player and a below average FT shooter, that's why i don't think he is a Top 5 scorer.  Carmelo Anthony in his prime was a more well rounded SCORER than LeBron James, yet people here want to say LeBron is Top 5 ever because he scored a lot of points, that's not how it works. A lot of people scored more points than Larry Bird, very few were better than him."
"In Missouri you've got a couple of fun young teams near you with bright futures.  I'd check out Memphis, OKC, and Indianapolis.  They'll all be in the bubble.  New Orleans drafted a guy named Zion Williamson that might be the best player in the league in a few years.  The Bulls are currently terrible and won't likely turn it around for a while.    The game is a bit less physical now than it was in the 90s, and that has helped 3-point shooters a ton and big guys are less emphasized.    LeBron James is at least arguably the second best player of all time behind Jordan, but he's on the back end of his prime.  He's currently on the Lakers and they're arguably the best team in the league.  His main competition in the West is the Clippers, who made some major offseason moves to bring in the MVP from last year's finals, Kawhi Leonard along with Paul George, another top ~10 player from the last few seasons.  The best team in the East is Milwaukee, with their star Giannis Antetokounmpo.  Giannis won MVP last year and is the favorite for it this year as well.  He's an absolutely ridiculous athlete.  Odds are one of those three teams will win the championship."
Lebron James loves the Chinese government. I remember the start of the season.
"We should just wait for LeBron James or Anthony Davis to decide they're sick of playing for their old teams and come to Denver! We're historically a big market, rich FA destination that doesn't have their upcoming superstars like Dekembe Mutumbo or Carmelo Anthony leave or demand a trade."

"&gt;Who was the Cavs’s primary ball handler then?  Lebron was during his last year but the year before Kyrie, Lebron, and Deron Williams split the role.  If by our you mean the Lakers, Rondo, Ball and James shared that duty last year with Rondo having his  minutes limited and coming off the bench this season."
Lakers winning it all? Not exactly a hot take.  Lebron winning MVP? More chance of James Harden weening himself of strip clubs.
"Does Patrick Beverley injure James Harden in this scenario? Prior to Westbrook's injury, I had OKC winning the west that year. OKC had a championship caliber team from 2012-16, but had injuries from 13-15, made the finals in 12 only to be beaten by a hungry LeBron, and ran into the 73-9 Warriors buzz saw. Aside from replacing an injured Westbrook with a healthy Harden in 2013, I don't see which year Harden would've gotten them over the hump."
**NICK NURSE MOVES TO 4-0 VS. LEBRON JAMES**

LEBRON JAMES
Lebron James is good at basketball.
I think it became very apparent how much of a team game basketball is to a lot of us when Lebron fucking James missed the playoffs.
"&gt;nobody wants to keep shooting because their percentages are shit  You might be right, but J.R. Smith, who hasn't shot the ball this game, even kind of hesitated shooting a somewhat open 3 pointer and passing the ball to LeBron James late in the shot clock, where LeBron passed it to JaVale McGee where the Lakers couldn't score before the shot clock expired. Plus, there's no better way than an open 3 pointer to increase your shooting percentage, unless that shot is an open layup. It's just frustrating, but oh well. Hopefully the Lakers become average at 3 point shooting again sometime later in the bubble in Orlando lol 💯💯💯"

#🚨 ALERT: LEBRON JAMES IS BEING LOOKED INTO FOR HOSTILE ACTS AGAINST THE TORONTO RAPTORS ORGANIZATION 🚨
Does he actually have Lebron or James?
So Lebron choosing to have “James” on the back of his jersey says pretty much all you need to know. He cares more about his brand then he does about anything else.
LeBron James just ran over Marc Gasol like it was nothing lol
"&gt;But why Kuz?  I've personally never been the biggest Kyle Kuzma fan, but he adds some size at the wing position in that lineup, especially since he's improved a bit on the defensive end. He's a pretty good finisher, and he's been rebounding really hard on both ends of the ball ever since after the trade deadline. He hasn't been shooting the 3 ball the best this season, but he's been pretty decent on corner 3's at least. I believe that he'll improve his 3 point shooting in the bubble in Orlando lol  The original comment's lineup could switch Markieff Morris for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope though to be more mobile defensively and add more shooting for LeBron James lol"

"&gt; If it’s just the natural progression of a rebuilding team then why are the suns still booty?  Because Suns are the opposite of what you want to do and have been booty for like 10 years now. Mavs are a good organization with elite head coach.  &gt;I really like Ayton and I think he’s super underrated. But Luka is better.  I like Luka but I think he is overrated. Maybe it is my unconcious bias because the Suns didn't draft him but I have several stats to show why I think he isn't that good but since he has such high usage many advanced stats that are box score based overrate him (and underrate players like Klay, and Dennis Rodman who don't stuff box scores).   &gt;Luka was pulling his team to the 2 seed at one point and shooting that efficiently.   This was like 12 game sample size start of the year. There have been small stretches where almost every team looks good even really bad ones. With the Mavs though, Luka has carried that MVP early season hype into much of the season as his TS has gone down and his team has lost more and more in comparison.  &gt;any point when Ayton never has is telling.  Because Ayton was suspended and isn't a guard. Ayton suspended was his fault but that doesn't mean he isn't as good or better. I just really like two way players that have elite on/off stats like Kawhi Leonard, Lebron James, Giannis, etc with the only exception of people who are really good at offense and high 3% like Harden and Curry. Those are my favorite types. Not the high usg box score guys who have mediocre on/off numbers."
"I had a dream last night that LeBron James was President, and now I think he really should run"
"I know that you just cited those particular players as an example, but that would leave the Lakers with a roster that looks like this:  &amp;#x200B;  Anthony Davis, Devontae Cacock  Kyle Kuzma  LeBron James, Jared Dudley  Danny Green, JR Smith, Horton-Tucker  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Alex Caruso, Rajon Rondo  &amp;#x200B;  The playoff rosters are shortened up to something like an 8-man rotation anyways and I think the Lakers are planning on giving Davis more time at the 5 in the playoffs. In your example, would it be nice to have Bender or Bogut? Ehh...I wouldn't say no in this particular circumstance but the league now has more players to worry about, accomodate, and compensate, all of whom are aren't on NBA rosters. And maybe those guys would rather stay overseas or wouldn't want to come into the bubble to just sit around."
"I know everyone is just saying white, but he’s a solid role player on one of the most popular and historic teams in sports. He’s also playing on said team with Lebron James, the best and most popular athlete post Jordan. People meme his looks, but dudes a solid player and any playoff team would be happy to have him in their 8 man rotation"
"They went from a team that was barely out of the playoffs to a team that is barely in the playoffs because of Luka. He should get credit for that but not comparisons to Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Aang from Avatar (there was a thread on that recently) etc. Lebron took a very crap team into the finals at a very young age. Luka took a team that is on the edge of being playoffs to barely being in the playoffs."
"For me ,there is different tiers of stars  True Superstar, Borderline Superstar, All Star and Borderline All Star (all star caliber)  Guys like LeBron, Kawhi, KD, Steph Curry, James Harden, Giannis etc, are guys that have the accolades of MVP, Finals MVP, first option success, deep playoff runs,  players that will put you over the hump of what it takes to contend for a championship   Borderline true Superstars for me are guys like AD, Paul George, Jokic, Embiid, Westbrook, Lillard etc are players that have mild/good success of playoff runs, accolades, can be 1st option players, but I don't think they're over the hump players for contention from their resume of work.  I like Luka, I think he's in a good range of All Star-Borderline Superstar  Ben Simmons is an All Star. He expands his range of shooting, post moves/counter moves, he may move into a borderline superstar."
"Superstar: Very few of them. Very popular, MVP candidates if everything goes their way, All-NBA candidates. Can carry a team. Will always be blamed for a loss.   LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard   Star: Need good players around them to be in contention. Popular, All-Stars. May be blamed for a loss.   Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Pascal Siakam, Dame, Jokic, Lowry, Kemba, etc.   Great player: A lot of players fall into this category. The top of them are borderline all-stars. Very inconsistent or have glaring flaws. Can put up good numbers on a bad team, but are role players on a good team. Can be blamed for a loss, generally won’t.   Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka, Jamal Murray, Dlo, Zach LaVine, John Collins, Enes Kanter, Andrew Wiggins, Lonzo Ball, etc   Role players: Do their job and that’s it. Not in All-star contention. Most of the league is this. Can start or come of the bench. Will never be blamed for a loss.   Theis, Chris Boucher, Josh Richardson, Myers Leonard, Terry Rozier, Kuzma, JaMychal Green, etc"

I’d think you could come up with something better than that  Why are single motherhood rates higher in the black community than before the civil rights movement, is America more racist now?"
"LeBron James in 2009.  Averaged 35-9-7 in a far more defensive period than the one today, and had epic moments such as this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkvTLOhm-TQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkvTLOhm-TQ)"
1. Michael Jordan/Lebron   2. Wilt Chamberlain/Ben Wallace   3. Kevin Durant/ Kareem  4. James Harden/Gary Payton  5. Kobe Bryant/ Lonzo Ball  6. Kareem/ Anthony Davis/ Shaq  7. Allen Iverson/ Isiah Thomas
"I think why Lebron didn’t do the jersey slogan was a legacy thing. If he ends up winning a championship here, it’s going to be important to him from a legacy stand point that it’s still just “James” on his jersey. That way his championship with LA will be documented, and his photo shots/ video clips will still say “James” which is what is most important to him; His brand."
"That depends on what you consider worse:  Lebron being a hypocrite for his selfish comments that threw Hong Kong and democracy under the bus OR  Gandhi being a literal pedophile and a racist who firmly believed in eugenics who led India to successful nonviolent protests against the British  Gandhi must have sacrificed a lot of little girls in the name of nonviolent protest!  How the hell are you trying to compare Gandhi and Lebron James lmao his job is an athlete, even if he is a very high profile person. Gandhi was a political and spiritual leader, compare him to the Dalai Lama or Dr. King, no one is going to Lebron asking for spiritual leadership or how to stop the war on drugs lol"
“Way less shooting” don’t forget AD has lebron freaking James lmaoo
Yeah we also have LeBron James and AD.
"Yeah I saw the breakdown but it was one game.   He also spent the entirety of the 2018 ECF hiding from Morris and had one of his worst-ever playoff performances against him. Morris was also the 2nd best LeBron defender in 2016-17 (one of the main reasons we signed him in 2017 according to Ainge).   We've also seen James Harden hunt for Marcus Smart matchups because of the history they have against each other. Sometimes great offensive players just like to make examples out of guys who have bothered them in the past.   LeBron can score on Morris if he sets his mind to it, LeBron can score on anyone if he sets his mind to it. It's not about stopping him, it's about making him work.   LeBron's asked to do so much on both ends in the playoffs. If you can make him work, he'll fatigue. Morris can make him work."
Ok you want stats? They pretty much have the exact [same Defensive rating](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id1_select=James+Harden&amp;player_id1=hardeja01&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;y1=2020&amp;player_id2_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id2_select=LeBron+James&amp;player_id2=jamesle01&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;y2=2019) this year. Your defense talking point is 6 or 7 years too late   How the fuck can you talk up LeBrons playoff record without acknowledging he’s been in the East his entire playoff career lmao. Pretty important thing to just leave out of there.   Also is irrelevant to this year but whatever
Uhhh...how about lebron James
"Man, Luka goes from LeBron James for most of the game to not being able to complete open layups or make super basic passes in the clutch.  He doesn't like the big moments, and that's a major problem."
"No lie, James Hardin the best scorer I've seen since MJ.   He's not the player on the whole the LeBron is, but that man gets buckets"
Shirts wont do anything change peoples hearts will that's why he prays to try and change people about racism he has good intentions plus he isnt even one of the well known players around the league he's not lebron james
after lebron there ain’t nobody better than harden. kawhi and steph and giannis — they can have a tie. but none of them are better than james.   y’all are as fucking ignorant as your social issues... someone please leave a comment; ill give you gold.
"The Clippers didn't have Lebron fucking James in his prime, so I'd have a hard time calling the roster better. Curry was doing ""God knows what"" during which series, the Clippers one? He averaged 25 points, 50% from the field and 50% from 3. Also, give me any superstar and I can cherry pick one playoff series where they looked like trash. Of coursec the series that you bring up, Curry didn't even play bad, so you clearly have some sort of vendetta against him."
"Bucks has a relatively older team, locked in with contracts to Middleton and assuming Giannis if he stays.  Honestly, I'm more concerned with Philly and Simmons figuring shit out lol  As good as Giannis is, seeing as he's literally playing at an MVP level, I still don't think he's at the level of prime LeBron James. Harden is arguably playing at the same level and nobody is claiming that he'll dominate an entire conference"
Did you just call Harden a mix of Steph Curry and LeBron James hahaha smh man
"Less than 1 quarter in, and James Harden already has 3 times as man free throws as Lebron did last night"
What a leap. Get the salt out of your eyes and figure out context.  The idea that Giannis gets superstar whistles and LEBRON FUCKING JAMES does not is laughable.
Even LeBron fucking James doesn’t get this many calls
Lebron James becomes Lechoke in these Clippers games. He seriously can't do anything anything the Clippers' wings. Fouled both Kawhi and PG on that last possession too. Doubt they'll win more than 1 game in the playoffs without paying off the refs again.
"You don't get it, do you? Or are you just being intentionally dense? It's not just the t shirt, it's the discussions that the t shirts and similar acts of peaceful protest bring.

"Dirk’s cast wasn’t bad. They were just old and looked bad in front of the Heat superteam   Jason Kidd, Shawn Marion, Tyson Chandler, Peja Stojaković were all very good vets and solid players. Deshawn Stevenson, Barea were really good too. Jet was looking like a borderline all-Star averaging 18 points. This was **MORE** than LeBron James averaged that series.   Hakeem on the other hand had a backcourt of Kenny Smith and Vernon Maxwell. His next best scorer averaged 13.4 points. That was the biggest carryjob in history"
"The title of this is misleading.  In the article Kerr only says that he should've backed up Morey in terms of his right to free speech, but he doesn't say that he backed the substance of Morey's tweet.  Kerr said, ""He can say anything he wants and we should support him in that and that's the main message. And then if you want to get into the depths of a really complex issue then you can have a conversation.""  Maybe more of us should be more openminded to the idea that the issue cannot be summed up in a 7 word tweet.  So there are two things here - supporting Morey's right to say whatever he wants (everyone does), and the other is the content of the tweet, which is a much more complex issue, which LeBron James spoke on."

Everyone can succeed in America. Everyone just needs to born with genes to be 6’ 9” 240 lbs of muscle and fast as a cheetah- like Lebron James. I don’t know what the complaint is about. Just do that.
"It's not nuanced though!   It's only nuanced if you're trying to make excuses for Lebron James scolding Daryl Morey like a child despite having no idea what he's talking about.  Everyone in this thread defending the NBA players is using their right to criticize their own government (or if they're outside of the USA, they almost certainly have that same right).   We all clearly like that right.   I like being able to call Trump a stupid fascist and not go to jail for it.   Lebron, and many other NBA personalities, have rightfully called Trump a dumb bully and I love that they did that.  The people protesting in Hong Kong just want the same rights that Lebron enjoys!   It's basic human empathy.   This whole idea that if they don't have the same color skin as me, or they grew up in a different situation from me, then it's completely impossible to support their struggle and weigh in on it is absurd.   That's literally what empathy is!   Being able to understand someone else's issues and struggle despite not having experienced the same thing.   White people are rightfully being asked to do that with BLM -- it is not crazy to ask that others attempt the same thing to a group overseas.  It's literally stopping and thinking ""Oh man, so in Hong Kong they have the right to protest and speak their mind if they disagree with the government, and in mainland China they don't.    I also have that right, and I enjoy it.   Mainland China is trying to take that right away from them -- I would definitely not like that, so I see where they're coming from.""  It becomes ""nuanced"" when people start putting China's ""territorial integrity"" (ie the ability of a dystopian capitalist state to extract additional resources and demand obedience from Hong Kong) on the same level as the human rights of the individuals protesting.     That doesn't sound like a humanitarian to me -- it sounds a lot like the mentality that the absolute worst people on the right in America have -- but please keep saying that it's nuanced."
"I don't think you get what I'm saying. And you just keep going through some bullshit loopholes to try and validate your flawed logic.  1. It's as simple as they're being hypocrites because they have a financial motive to stay quiet so essentially their money is more important than democracy and police brutality going on in Hong Kong especially considering they're completely disappearing people and have control of the news.  2. I'm not saying BLM and they don't have legitimate grievances. It's just that the whole silence is violence and complicit is completely bullshit when they're doing the same exact thing. Meanwhile people like you are trying to give credence to that bullshit logic by saying stuff like oh it doesn't affect them and oh they must be just uneducated in the matter, when the same athletes are going around saying everyone and every race should stand up and say something or else you're a racist who stands with police violence. Which is an even bigger travesty when it takes less than ten minutes to explain the historical context of the handing over of Hong Kong and the tumultuous situation the citizens are facing. When black athletes buy into Chinese propaganda it's being uneducated and unfamiliar with the matter, but when its people falling for the right wing propaganda it's racism? That's a huge logical inconsistency.   3. So you're saying the NBA as a whole coming together and saying they support Hong Kong would have zero impact? Then thats like saying soccer players in Europe kneeling has absolutely no impact, which is outright false. The more eyes and ears the situation can garner the better it is.   4. Apple is a company. This sort of whataboutism is far worse than you claiming the argument that LeBron James is hypocritical is whataboutism LMAO. People expect LBJ to speak out because he is the one that came out saying they're more than athletes and shit like that. If you can't understand the nuance of the situation, then you're too young lmfao."
"&gt; You seem to be confusing ""popularity"" with something else.  I'm saying a higher percentage of the world knew Jordan than know LeBron. lol  &gt; He had tv commercials and magazine ads at the most. 2 things that are dead/dying forms of media.   Lol they are dead/dying now, they were the only game in town when Jordan was at his height.  That limited choice of media made those limited choices even more powerful.  You're trying to tell me those McDonald's ads didn't help his popularity because you think they're dead in 2020?  &gt;  It is much more common for non-basketball fans to recognize these players than it was back in the 90s. Period. You CAN NOT argue otherwise.  I can and am lol I'm not talking about whether people knew Steve Kerr on sight, I'm talking about Michael Jordan.  The man's face was everywhere.  &gt; You're basically saying all the advancements companies have made using social media and the internet in general to market someone haven't made any difference whatsoever and that's just plain ignorant.  I'm not saying they've made no difference, I'm saying the world is changed and they have to work harder to cut signal through the noise.  Jordan was the most famous man on the planet for most of the '90s.  Do you think LeBron James is the most famous man on the planet? lol Obviously not, because social media and attention span saturation have fragmented the public eye into so many options."
Clippers vs. Lakers L2M Report:  * Kawhi Leonard should've been called for a travel.  * Leonard should've been called for a kick ball.  * Marcus Morris Sr. should've been called for a personal foul guarding LeBron James.  * James didn't foul Paul George on his final shot.

Your so focused on LeBron that you forgot about all the other  players bitching out and saying no comment. Now that's a pussy move. At least LeBron had the balls to come out and say what he felt. I still remember James Harden and Stephen Curry were not educated enough to comment on the situation lmao that's a thousand times worse.
"i wonder in what world you can view daryl morey as the selfish one but not lebron ""how will this affect me financially"" james.  but anyway thanks for reminding me of why i avoid politics.  cant even criticize the obvious hypocrisy of someone without being compared to trump.  you people always turn it into this left vs right narrative."
"Zach Lowe on whether LeBron should be all defense this season.  &gt;LeBron has a real case. Some internal team metrics rate James -- not Davis -- as the Lakers' best defender this season, per sources around the league. To me, he's kind of the Chris Paul of forwards -- often guarding the least threatening opposing player. He's still a super-dangerous ball hawk, but the competition for these spots is too fierce.  So based of this LeBron's defense is good enough that it warrants consideration for an all defense selection (second team that is) but the part where you said he routinely guards the best ball handlers is incorrect. From my memory the Lakers would throw either KCP or Kuzma on those types of players"
[LeBron James allowed 1 point on 15 second-half possessions guarding Kawhi Leonard and Paul George last night via Second Spectrum courtesy of @GetUpESPN.](https://twitter.com/thelakersreview/status/1289247171024269313?s=21)
For Lebron James to infer that Darryl Morey (MIT Grad) isn't educated on something he speaks about is asinine.  Lebron is a cancer to this league regardless of how great of a talent he is.
"Lebron is a business man lol. The only reason he is doing this is because his own money will be affected by the situation.  Are you suffering from Stockholm syndrome or something? Lebronto was years ago. You already won a chip and you're still sucking on lebron james' nuts.  I am lakers fan and a fan of Lebron's game but I am not a fan of his ""More than an athlete"" fake personality because he is just a business man who cares about money not on social injustices.   Quit sucking on it man"
"Found this link which estimates it around ~50 mil, but this doesn’t seem like a fully exhaustive list.   https://born2invest.com/articles/lebron-james-generous-nba-star-today/"
"LeBron never said otherwise? This was the quote:   ""I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. **I'm not discussing the substance.** Others can talk about that,"" James said in a tweet."
"This issue does impact Lebron directly.  The NBA gets a nice slice of revenue from NBA-China, the NBA is outspoken on social issues, justice, equality, and Lebron James is a champion for these causes.  The NBA and Lebron's silence concerning the genocide of ethnic muslims in China of which they are direct participants/ beneficiaries is shocking and sad.  The hypocrisy takes away from everything Lebron and the NBA stands for. Lebron's part in resolving this is not difficult.  Come out and speak against this genocide, back out of China, condemn the CCP's actions.  Lebron and the NBA may be the group who could really start the process of saving hundreds of thousands of people in western China.  Make Lebron James accountable, make Lebron speak up on this issue.  I'm not a Lebron hater -- this is not political to me."

What is interesting about this? It's LeBron fucking James and he's driving in for a game winning shot. Obviously everyone's gonna collapse.
Lebron James: Constantly speaks out on social issues yet will happily profit hundreds of millions off of slave labor
“An injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere” - MLK Jr  “An injustice anywhere except China is a threat to justice everywhere” - Lebron James
"Talkin' 'bout LeBron ""China"" James?"
"Imagine Lebron in crunch time, guarded perfectly by Kawhi, being unable to shot and so he passes to Davis who misses and lakers get the L.  Every soul on this planet would shit on James, brutally. And we know it's true."
"Sexual assault allegations tend to put a damper on someone's career accomplishments. [The lady dropped the civio case](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28230870/woman-drops-sexual-assault-lawsuit-kings-coach-luke-walton) and the NBA's investigation was fruitless, but I would imagine it still affects his public image.  Also: he couldn't make a team work with Ingram and Ball who are thriving under a different system.  Also: his dad is still cooler than him at 67.  Also: that Lebron team was the worst Lebron team in the history of Lebron teams, maybe ever. Maybe not. But bottom 3. I think a lot of it was James' fault for alienating half of his teammates, but that type of situation takes leadership and, uhh...idk Luke just looked ready to cry from like February forward"
"What do those getting all over Barkley have to say about Lebron choosing to wear “James” on his jersey?   I know Barkley has a past of making some **DUMB** remarks, but what’s the issue if he’s just tying to point out that everyone is entitled to having their own way of demonstrating their support for social justice?  Frankly, I had no issue with the MLB choosing to kneel in unity, and solidarity prior to the anthem, then rise for the anthem. I also had no issue with Betts or all of the NBA players kneeling. That’s their right.  I guess my point is that Chuck doesn’t deserve to be roasted for what he said."
"""The white moderate who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;"" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season."" - MLK,   Lebron james should know inaction or dismissing minorities being openly opress is somehow okay for Hong Kong but not for Black Americans is the definition of hypocrisy. How can you convince other communities to if a shit about BLM if you turn the cheek on the same atrocities because of money."

I remember a lot of conspiracy youtube videos coming out about lebron being on roids then within a few weeks he decides to tell the world he spends $1 million a year on his body and shows what he does haha. The interesting/relevant thing is the theories suggested he gets his roids in Orlando!  [http://dystnow.com/2013/03/04/lebron-james-jameer-nelson-linked-to-miami-steroid-clinic/](http://dystnow.com/2013/03/04/lebron-james-jameer-nelson-linked-to-miami-steroid-clinic/)
"Nice try.  I support BLM but do not support hypocrites.  LeBron James legit tried to get someone in trouble for speaking out against police brutality in Hong Kong and stated people shouldn’t talk about things they aren’t “educated on” at a time of viral videos being released of several police beating a pregnant woman into the ground.  At the same time they use quotes like “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice anywhere”.  The majority of the league has been completely silent about Hong Kong to be allowed to continue to market their products there.  They chose profit over humanity.  Why should we listen to anyone who chooses profit over humanity.  Oh what do I do?  I vote for candidates that support meaningful change and when they fail to deliver it, I vote for ones who do.  I boycott companies that support or pander to the CCP."
This Lebron James guy has a pretty decent future in the NBA.
Have you ever watched LeBron James play?
"“Whether a person decided to fight for social justice, play basketball, focus on physical or mental health, or simply connect with their families, this initiative can hopefully support their priorities and decisions,’’ Irving said in a recent statement....   “In a time when society is calling out police brutality, social injustices, and systemic racism, it is critical to magnify how these unjust behaviors and practices are directly impacting Black women. I stand for Breonna Taylor, Sandra Bland, and the countless women whose names are never said but have shared the same unfortunate fate,” he wrote in a statement....   Said Irving at the time: “It’s bigger than all of us. We have to take a stand together. It’s truly important that we do.”...   (Those in NBA circles can point to 2014 as when Irving began to publicly take an interest in social justice, as it was Irving who delivered the “I Can’t Breathe” shirts honoring Eric Garner to the Cleveland Cavaliers locker room that LeBron James famously wore during lineups.)"
"the 2nd year Miami LeBron, or 2009 Cabs LeBron easily blow this year's LeBron by any metrics offensively and defensively. and I mean any metrics.   I'm sorry if you think this mid 30s LeBron is the best version of LeBron James, I cannot respect your opinion in terms of evaluating players."
Why does it seem that 90% of r/nba are just now remembering that LeBron James has been the best basketball player on the planet for the last 10-15 years?
Lebron fucking James does it again guys
"LeBron James for those last few minutes of the 4th quarter was awesome to watch. The play just before this he misses a floater, grabs his own rebound and lays it in over 3 defenders? Incredible."
"https://www.si.com/nba/2016/12/01/lebron-james-sportsperson-cavaliers-tyronn-lue-game-7-finals  That's from 2016 but more has come out about that after Ty Lue's departure from Cleveland. Basically, Lebron flipped a shit about being called out and Ty Lue told him to stop acting like a child, they yelled at each other and then won a championship."
"&gt; For years now, the debate between Michael Jordan and Lebron James for the greatest of all time has caused countless arguments **and sometimes even broken up relationships**  Name one  I'm nitpicking this one thing because I think it's the only thing worth talking about in your post, which has been rehashed on a weekly (at least) basis on this sub for years."
Ain't nobody speaking for you KYRIE. You say all this shit yourself. In what planet do you really believe that KD is the only game closer you've ever played with after you won a championship with lebron James.
"Are you sure? Because Rondo/Davis/McGee played 44 total minutes this season. You can't just put this shit all on Rondo lmao. He was terrible but Davis just doesn't have the skillset to lead an elite team when he isn't shooting over 50% from mid-range. He isn't an elite playmaker or point of attack scorer.   Here are LeBron/Davis/Rondo lineups without either star:  &gt; LeBron James + Rajon Rondo w/o Anthony Davis: 358 minutes, +13.4  &gt; Anthony Davis + Rajon Rondo w/o LeBron James: 357 minutes, -4.9  Let's see LeBron/Rondo/Kuzma/Davis lineups without either star:  &gt; LeBron James + Rajon Rondo + Kyle Kuzma w/o Anthony Davis: 284 minutes, +17.3  &gt; Anthony Davis + Rajon Rondo + Kyle Kuzma w/o LeBron James: 236 minutes, -8.3  Let's see LeBron/Davis/Howard/Caruso lineups without either star:  &gt; LeBron James + Alex Caruso + Dwight Howard w/o Anthony Davis: 229 minutes, +22.7  &gt; Anthony Davis + Alex Caruso + Dwight Howard w/o LeBron James: 105 minutes, +2.4  Notice a trend?"

You sure you want to die on this hill?"
"While this may be true, it's also true that LeBron is 12/23 for 52% on game tying and go ahead shots in the playoffs(last 10 seconds of 4Q/OT) while Kobe is 5/22 for only 22%. For comparisons sake Kyrie Irving is 1/3 for 33%, Steph Curry is 2/9 for 22%, Kevin Durant is 2/13 for 15%, Damien Lillard is 4/8 for 50%, and MJ is 7/15 for 47%. Also if you look at the same stats but increase the time to the last 24 seconds of the 4Q/OT LeBron James is 10/27 for 37% while Kobe 7/28 for 25%."
He's done so for one single postseason on the back of shooting that cannot be maintained. That doesn't mean he's better.   And it's pretty preposterous to say that he played better than Leonard in the regular season when his team looked completely and utterly inept without LeBron James.
I don't think this Anthony Davis we're seeing is a product of playing next to LeBron James. He's just shooting an at unsustainable level. He'll look the same as he did in his New Orleans games with maybe a few less points when he comes back to Earth and this nonsense of him being in the best player in the world conversation will die down.
"You can tell how stupid someone is when they use ""hE's In ThE fInAlS"" as an argument while totally ignoring the fact that he's playing with LeBron James lmao."
What did he think was going to happen? You played with Lebron Freaking James. For you to say this is the FIRST time you could defer to a teammate? That obviously is saying you could not defer to Bron in the past. Clown yet again.
Lebron James &gt; Michael Jordan
"  Nothing, this sub has zero fucking clue what it’s talking about when it comes to coaching.

"Lebron James hit a three with 20 seconds left to bring the heat within 3 points. Then Allen hits the three to bring to game to OT where James (2points, 2 assists in OT) is responsible for every point except Allen’s free throws. In OT/4th quarter James assisted or scored 28 of the heats final 38 points. Ray Allen came in clutch but this whole ‘ray saved Lebron’ narrative is tired."
Remember AD in New Orleans? Y’all gotta stop acting like this dude is the second best player in the nba now that he’s about to win a championship with lebron James. He’s a superstar but he’s far from better than embiid

"lebron not being clutch is just silly, he's basically the ultimate 'get you there' player, and he's shown plenty of times he can be there 'win it there' player too     if i needed one player in the history of the league to be my guy to lead my team to late in the 4th, i don't think it's even close, i'd take lebron james to get me to a win or a place i can win a game     to close out the last few minutes? that's jordan     who would i trust with it all on the line in one shot? larry bird      lebron ain't a shooter like the other two, but it's not like he can't shoot, and he's hit a lot of huge shots in playoff games including game winners in big games, the notion he's not clutch is just.. blatantly false     literally the only flaw in his game is free throws, but ask denver or eastern conference teams what it's like when lebron is hitting his shot in close out games"

"Kyrie has some massive insecurities about Lebron James, it's really palatable and tasty to my senses."
"Only if Lebron James gets a 4-peat with the Lakers or if Shannon Sharpe gets a IT job editing the NBA website. Then it'll say ""Goat James is the greatest basketball player of all time""."
"&gt;That would have been the worst fucking combo ever.  You know I can think of some worse combos than LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, and Paul George together."
LeBron James Chad 5000 sex doll.
"Going from a coach who wants to control everything both on and off the court to a coach who just wants to be everybody's pal...what could go wrong?  Don't get me wrong, Lue did good work with the Cavs...but he also had LeBron James there to help call the shots instead of Kawhi and PG."
"Of course not.  He is fraud, a coattails ""star"". He was barely better than Jerry Stackhouse.  He only performed when he had better players as teammates, like Jermaine O'neal, Shaquille O'neal and LeBron James.  I do not know why north-americans fell for this."
"The best resource I ever found for this argument is the Backpicks GOAT list.    https://backpicks.com/2017/12/11/the-backpicks-goat-the-40-best-careers-in-nba-history/  https://backpicks.com/2018/04/12/backpicks-goat-1-kareem-abdul-jabbar/  https://backpicks.com/2018/04/08/backpicks-goat-2-michael-jordan/  https://backpicks.com/2018/04/05/backpicks-goat-3-lebron-james/  Especially these figures where they plot Title Odds on Random Team over time are very insightful. What this shows is Jordan made his team &gt;30% better in his prime three years, and still an all-time great 25ish% in six more years. rose to a higher level more quickly than Lebron, who actually wasn't really thát great until 2009. That absolute top level and dominance is something nobody has ever come close to. Lebron, though, made his team about 25% better for probably one more year now. In other words: pure talent wise relative to their time period, Jordan is the greatest, but if you factor longevity very highly, then Lebron starts maybe getting a shout lately. But, valuing longevity means Kareem actually still beats out Lebron as well, at least according to this list maker who does value longevity very highly, as Kareem was making his team's title odds better by roughly 20% for 12 long years, and did it also from the get-go.  The list is flawed in some ways of course, as it seems to be biased in favor of dominant centers and doesn't factor in anecdotal stuff like actually getting to or winning your finals, all-time great playoff performances, memorable box score stats, mvp or all-nba awards, etceteta. But I would say the scale tips even further away from Lebron if you start to factor those in."
Haha I can already imagine the talks in 2035. “Luka is way more clutch and a better leader than Lebron because of yada yada..”  At some point the media should give LeBron James his well-deserved flowers. Even his haters too
"Barkley, Malone and Dirk were all MVPs. Imagine if they got to play alongside Michael Jordan/LeBron James instead of against them in the finals.      That should help put into perspective how ridiculous a question this is."
"Dirk is definitely still better for the moment. AD has only played half a career so it’s impossible to say he’s already better than an all-time great MVP Charles Barkley or a top 5 scorer of all time Karl Malone. He would probably be on track to surpass Barkley, but one single title doesn’t mean much in terms of all time rankings, especially when it’s won with Lebron James."
"This doesn't really clarify anything, like at all.  He said KD was the first player he can defer to for clutch shots. He didn't say names but the way he talked it addresses every player he ever played with by default. Just because he didn't say LeBron James, or meant LeBron, or was comparing LeBron and KD, LeBron is part of it by default.  It's crazy he's been in the league and public eye this long and has no clue how to speak without generating controversy. If he didn't want a brother vs brother situation like he said all he had to do was say something like: I think we'll have something special next year. I really like that I trust you to take the clutch shot too. It's not all on me."
"“I knew that this guy loved Lebron James and just because this guy liked him was enough for me. You think he’s a GOAT? OK, fine. I’m going to show you he’s not.”"
"LeBron ""Walter White"" James:  SAY MY NAME"
"My point was that he wasn’t the best player on the floor. I’m not saying he didn’t deserve it, because unless you do some weird Jerry West era stuff, it wasn’t going to LeBron.   My point was that his first FMVP performance didn’t necessarily indicate that he was top 3 in the league. Like, most people still would’ve said KD/LeBron, probably CP3, Blake Griffen, James Harden etc.   Given that, we’re looking really only at performances that would inspire people to confidently state he’s one of the best in the league. There was no doubt he was good after he performed in the 2014 finals, but the only thing that really forced him into T3-5 consideration was his (very impressive) playoff run last year.   Like I said, his first FMVP was great. But if you asked me right after if I thought he was a top 3 player and MVP candidate, I (and many others) probably would’ve said no."
"jfc lebron ""not a scorer"" james is #6, how  seeing him 3 full points above kobe is pretty mindblowing imo, even though kobe scored less in his first run with shaq"
I remember before Lebron James was a laker i had to dispute why Kobe was more clutch than LeBron. None of the stats supported my take so i just used a fabricated term called “killer instinct”  and brought out quotes from players saying they would  let Kobe take the last shot over anyone to  justify my reasoning. I too was guilty of not believing Lebron was clutch cause the media has brainwashed me.
I like how Kyrie is pretending he is a better option than Lebron freakin James overall
"Kawhi had the luxury to play under great coaches and teams who had in place good systems, but AD is playing with fucking Lebron James, one of the best floor raisers if not the greatest ever, on top of being a great facilitator."
Anthony Davis is currently the second-best player in the league after Lebron James. He's made a huge leap in these playoffs in his offensive game and has always been one of the top defenders in the league.
"Not for me, friend. Kobe changed me a lot, in that regard. I'm thankful that we get to watch LeBron James and other amazing athletes perform at the peak of human competition.  That being said, LeBron has made a few mistakes here and there, but the man is an honest to God role model that I would be proud for my son, or anyone elses son, to emulate. Doing this shit since 19 years old too, his mental toughness is unreal."
"I remember being really hyped for the finals for the ‘15 season and my fellow manager and I were talking about it and how hyped we were for Bron. One of the lower level guys overheard us and got visibly angry at me because I like LeBron James. He got to the point of slandering me to customers and irrationally not liking me after several years of a pretty sound work relationship. He told another employee that he would beat my ass in the parking lot if LeBron won. The lack of evidence is the only reason I didn’t can his ass. He was scrubbing the toilets every fucking day until I left though.   I don’t get how people can get so angry about something like this. We can argue all day long about it, actually being angry and making threats or fighting about something like this is a joke."
"&gt; kawhi had a better team, right? so why does it come down to AD having one teammate that's better than kawhi's entire team?  I think AD was hands down better than Kawhi this year so I'm not arguing against that but come on.  It's LeBron James, it isn't absurd at all to put forth the argument that having LeBron on your team is better than having a deep and solid roster.  Also, Kawhi vs AD is a dumb argument. You take a different one depending on the build of your team. If you swapped them this season they each would have worse seasons."
Yeah because the game fucking blew and the world is burning down.  The average TV viewer isn’t worried about LeBron James winning his 50th finals game.
"I'm not saying he's a bad coach, but the problem with Ty Lue is that he is demanding crazy high money for a coach who barely has a head coaching resume.  He took over as head coach of a Final team midway through the season led by Lebron James and now acts as though he has this tremendous coaching pedigree because he happened to be on the sidelines during the 2016 Finals. The Cavs won the 2016 Finals because Draymond got suspended and Lebron was unbelievable. Ty Lue is not the reason the Cavs won 2016, but Ty Lue acts like he was a main reason for that title and wants to get paid like one of the best coaches in the league"
"Ya I don’t think I have quite the influence of kyrie and I also don’t think I played and won a championship w Lebron James  Maybe I’m trippin tho  If someone else like d wade said that we would have the same reaction, have fun w that shit show of a nets team"
"The hype for Lebron James in high school was out of this world. There has never been higher expectations. And then he *exceeded* them. People don't understand how rare it is to even *meet* crazy high, daydreaming expectations, and how impossible it is that he did even more."
"I would say:  Lebron: ""U BUM""  Broussard: ""Cuban begging (thru text)""  Aaron Bruski: ""Clippers meeting with Durant was “intense” and “at one point Steve Ballmer was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned""  Spears: ""Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!” Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"""
"Since you listed Tobias Harris, I’ll use him as a cutoff...all players who get significant playing time 6’8” and above for both teams:  JaVale McGee, Dwight Howard, AD, Kyle Kuzma, Lebron James, Markieff Morris  Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Al Horford, Kyle O’quinn, Tobias Harris.    So yeah, Lakers are as big as the sixers.   They very intentionally got big, going after Cousins first, then Dwight after Cousins got hurt."

"Because thats the player the team looks to the most for points  Lebron literally said if youre not playing through AD, youre misusing him  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27715733/lebron-james-not-playing-anthony-davis-why-him%3fplatform=amp"
"WHO AND WHERE ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW OF LEBRON JAMES ?!?  Now I can't speak for every country and every neighborhood around the world like you are, but sports programming / news in many countries cover the NBA, wtf are you on about ? I agree, to a point, that jordans popularity in the 90s was extremely high even by today's standards given the technology differences, and that he helped the NBA rise in popularity so much that's it is hard to make that kind of jump again 20 years later.   You also say totally absurd shit. Using always and never to make your points is low level rookie hot take garbage. A lot of what you say about MJ is obviously valid, but uhh there were pioneers in basketball before MJ, and there have been since. I know, for a fact, that ""When someone says basketball, Michael Jordan is the first player that pops up on everyones mind"" is a false statement. A lot if people, the majority sure, but not everyone.  I'm not even trying to argue that LeBron is ""greater"" or better, but saying he will always be the greatest and best is STUPID, because you and me will be dead and people will still be playing basketball.  Also, LeBron was a nationally known sensation in high school because his highschool basketball games were on ESPN, and he started playing in the  NBA at 18."
"Efficiency plays a part in who is the better scorer, but being a first option literally means you are the first option to score. LeBron not only has the ball in his hands more but he attempts more shots as well. He is the first option. Anthony Davis is the second option. Anthony Davis is still an amazing offensive player who could easily be the first option on most other NBA teams like he was on the Pelicans.  Being the second option to LeBron James isn't a bad thing, it's LeBron. Same way it wasn't a bad thing that Kobe was the second option to Shaq in some seasons and Shaq was the second option to Kobe in some seasons. They were both first option calibre players minus Kobe's first couple of seasons."
"Yes, you can look at it that way. Or someone who is most likely to attempt to score, which again is LeBron on the Lakers.  LeBron handles the ball, initiates plays, creates for other and attempts to score himself more than AD does. If you look at the Lakers as a unit that is choosing between their options to score on offense, the one they go to more frequently is LeBron James."
Losing to a LeBron James lead team does not hurt your legacy.
"""They allow me to lead them, and I respect them for that, and I'm humbled by that, as well."" - LeBron James  That's a badass quote right there."
"Remind me what AD was doing without LeBron fucking James in Pelicans? He was injured half the time and made the playoffs once.  I don't know how he's not getting injured now that he's on the Lakers. Makes me question his commitment to Pelicans and Basketball as a game. Also, you put any Star(not even superstar) with LeBron James, they are reaching the finals it seems. I will be interested to see AD do this as the main guy, not with LeBron James, possible Goat."
TIL Lebron James and Kyle Lowry are basically the same player.
More or less. His jump shooting has been better this playoffs but he was always a good midrange shooter just not great. It’s the reason why his efficiency is better than ever before in these playoffs. Other than that he’s been this good for the past 2 years and it has very little to do with LeBron. AD was doing this with Jrue as his playmaker he can do this with anyone.   The only difference between AD this playoffs and his last 2 years in the regular season is his jump shooting went from good to amazing which has caused his scoring efficiency to go from very good to ridiculously good. And he’s on a far better team (LeBron James) than he’s ever been on which means that when he plays well he actually wins.
Lebron James gave Dwight Howard depression.
"Uhh everyone and their grandma around the world knows about LeBron James. Why did you start off with such a special kind of condescending nonsense ? Kareem or dr J or Wilt or magic was the ""greatest"" of their time and condescending weirdos like you held on to that belief "" X player will always be the greatest' until they couldn't anymore.   That's like saying that Joe Montana is undoubtedly the geatest QB ever and will always be. By the logic you used, you're already wrong and it has nothing to do with how GREAT LeBron is."
"""Kyrie Irving is weird as fuck"" - Lebron James."
"Ah yes, a true underdog story. The LA Lakers led by LeBron James and Anthony Davis"
"organized haters more. ""**Lebron James Haters united""** exist."
"Some people just enjoy hating too much to ever change. The narratives that surround LeBron from these playoffs alone are insulting.  * ""Portland are the best 8th seed you could ever play,"" to ""He beat the 8th seed, let's relax.""  * ""Rockets have two legit superstars, Lakers will struggle,"" to ""Rockets are a spent force and D'Antoni needs to go.""  * ""Denver are the most dangerous team because they won't die,"" to ""Clippers would have been the toughest match up, LeBron got an easy go with Denver.""  Some people are STILL saying the Clippers would have taken the Lakers over a seven game series. Instead of looking for ways to diminish one of the best basketball players of all-time, give this man his flowers while he's here. The NBA will have a hard time transitioning from LeBron James."
Also [this](https://youtu.be/dHibkh57FFA). There’s also the story David Griffin told about [Lebron telling Patrick Patterson where he was suppose to be on a play during the ECF.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2018/5/10/17339950/lebron-james-knows-raptors-plays-better-than-raptors-players-david-griffin)
"Tony Parker, Westbrook, Derrick Rose (all quicker than MJ) couldn’t get past Lebron James. Stop with the bs."
"Nobody claimed that current steph curry is better than prime lebron james, but okay"
"The clippers had so much trouble handling Murray and Jokic, what's making people think that they will do significantly *better* against Lebron James and Anthony Davis?"
That's so cool. I think I found the article you're mentioning.  [https://www.businessinsider.com/raptors-computer-program-lebron-james-2013-3](https://www.businessinsider.com/raptors-computer-program-lebron-james-2013-3)  [https://deadspin.com/lebron-james-is-a-better-defender-than-the-computerized-456410614](https://deadspin.com/lebron-james-is-a-better-defender-than-the-computerized-456410614)
Joel Anthony route for sure. I KNOW I don't have the work ethic to be Lebron James even with the athleticism and whatnot.
"Spurs were perennial contenders except for the fact that they only remained contenders because Kawhi’s explosive growth is what offset their stars falling off a cliff production wise. By the time Kawhi was in his prime, the old spurs were role players. Winning 47-48 games doesn’t really mean anything, seeing as how they missed the playoffs or got bounced out the first round without him. With Kawhi, his team got to the 2nd round in 2016 and lost to a stacked okc squad, got the the conference finals in 2017 and lost to the warriors, and then won the chip in 2019. His teams success tanks when he’s not playing, so your point is moot. AD entirely missed the playoffs multiple times. It doesn’t matter how bad your team is because getting to the playoffs is the lowest bar possible.   I’m literally equating Kawhis teams winnings 60+ games for multiple years and getting deep in the playoffs to ADs 3 playoffs trips total, of which he’s played with Lebron in one, who is better than both Kawhi and AD. Kawhi won 8 playoffs series in the last 4 years to ADs 4. Kawhi had more success just last year than AD had in his entire career till this point and had the Stats to match without a player as good as Jrue Holiday or freaking Lebron james on his team.  I’m literally using double standards to benefit AD to offset Kawhis team success but Kawhi still clearly wins out."
Anthony Davis &gt; Kawhi Leonard because he's on an unsustainably hot shooting streak while playing alongside LeBron James. LMAO.
"When did I say that he ""carried"" the Spurs? The point is that he was clearly their best player and did not have a single offensive player as remotely good as LeBron James beside him, which is indisputable. Bringing up LaMarcus Aldridge, role players, and geriatrics as if they hold a candle to him is hilarious.   &gt; Kawhi-stans really saw him struggle to close out 40% of the Warriors in 6 games and acted like he's been hard carrying since 2014  Davis fans really saw him struggle to win 38 games season after season and act like he's in the conversation with Kawhi Leonard."
"I made it a point to see LeBron play live at least once.  He has a very forgettable game in a loss against a very bad Jazz team.  But whatever, still counts, I can say I've seen LeBron James play irl."
"There's more to play making than just passing the ball. Each of those players exerts pressure on a defense with their scoring that Davis does not.    Kawhi Leonard has led multiple title contenders without an elite play maker, including last season's Raptors. Our half court offense this season was dreadful without him because we couldn't get anything done in the half court. It was way better last season because Kawhi Leonard is the type of player to put an offense on his back even without LeBron James-level passing ability."
"The man in this series is Lebron james.  And also, points didnt mean shit on FMVP race, Iggy won over steph despite -10 points differences."
"The only version of Duncan, Ginobili, and Parker that Leonard had at his side as a superstar were the super old ones. Duncan was the best of the three and was a role player averaging less than 9 PPG when San Antonio had back-to-back 60+ win seasons earlier in the decade. Talk about being disingenuous lmfao. The rest of your comment is just drivel.   Kawhi Leonard has never once played with an offensive threat as good as LeBron James."
"Now this is some supremely ignorant shit lmao. In 2015-16 and 2016-17, LaMarcus Aldridge was San Antonio's second scoring option. Parker, Duncan, and Ginobili were all role players and geriatrics at that point. With the Raptors, Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam were the second and third options. Leonard has never played with a single player as threatening to a defense as LeBron James.   And as for your ""carrying"" point, Davis has never ""carried"" a team to dick besides 35 wins in a season lmfao. Refer to the 2019 semifinals for an all-time carry job by Kawhi Leonard."
"AD is playing next to LeBron James, can we stop comparing his success to the likes of Kawhi, Giannis and other guys who don't have the luxury of having the best player of this generation as a teammate?"
"All of that and also if I were a smart GM, I would definitely want to be in the conference without Lebron James for the majority of his career"
"K Love was more of a spot-up shooter/sometimes lowpost/rebounding player.   AD does everything from dribbling the basketball, to shooting jumpers and down in the low post. He plays defense and he gets rebounds. And of course his biggest attribute is that he is 7 feet tall. Is he more skilled than James Harden? No. But is he a better player? Yes. The height is a huge advantage.  Now let’s talk about Chris Bosh.  Chris Bosh is like somewhere in between as a catch and shoot guy who could score in the low post and he also plays good defense.   Chris Bosh is and was extremely underrated and under-appreciated.  Chris Bosh was CLUTCH. Offensively AND defensively. Sorry to say this but AD has never been clutch in big moments in his career (other than the shot he hit against Denver - but in reality who really cares about that meaningless shot in a 4-1 series that The Lakers are supposed to dominate) Chris Bosh was clutch in The NBA Finals. He switched the momentum many times in favor of Miami in order for them to win.  When people talk about is AD a better partner than Kyrie and D Wade. I would never put him pass D Wade and maybe you could put him over Kyrie after winning one. But I would not put him over Chris Bosh.  Without Chris Bosh, Lebron would’ve won only one (perhaps zero) in Miami."

"LeBron james dwight howard and Anthony davis are going to go down in history as some of the best big defenders. Takinge rondo will go down as one of the best stealers in nba history. Danny green has made all nba defensive teams several times. Alex caruso plays minutes because he's elite at intercepting passing lanes.   The amount of plays the lakers block, steal, and intercept passes is nothing like I've ever seen before. And they do it mostly without fouling. It's incredible."

"New Orleans didn’t have Lebron James, or literally any wings for that matter"
"&gt; When the Lakers were bad all you guys said was ""brand doesn't mean anything, you can't rely on your name and the past to get players nowadays"" and now that the Lakers got LeBron it's all ""he only went there because of the Lakers' name."" It gets old watching the narrative change every year.  Both of those things can be true. It explains why you guys sucked for 6 years, the longest stretch of the franchise being truly atrocious, and also why LeBron came to the Lakers, he is a unique case given the point he's at in his career and LeBron is no ordinary player.   Here's how stupidly run the Lakers are, they *missed* the playoffs last year with LeBron Fucking James, the GOAT of his generation, who hadn't missed the playoffs in FOURTEEN years. And before you say shit about ""we were 4th in the West before he got hurt,"" just stop, they were 27-28 in the 55 games that LeBron played, that winning % wasn't good enough to make the playoffs.   Your franchise was a clown show just as recently as last summer with what happened with Magic.  The Lakers front office and organization don't really deserve credit for the *basketball operation*, that's all LeBron and Rich Paul. That's what Windhorst is alluding to, this is all their doing."
"If kcp and Bradley get multi year contracts somewhere else, they’re not going to be that good without lebron James creating space and shots for them"
"We were nothing because our franchise player had a devastating injury and retired. We rebuilt. The moves the Lakers made and the assets they acquired put them in position to get LeBron James.   He wouldn't have signed here if he didn't think they could make the moves to get another star. The Lakers don't get that other star if the front office doesn't make the savvy moves to clear the Mozgov deal and draft attractive assets the Pelicans could take for Anthony Davis. Or are we just ignoring how fucked the situation was when Mosgov and Deng signed those deals? Give the front office credit for pulling them out of that.  When the Lakers were bad all you guys said was ""brand doesn't mean anything, you can't rely on your name and the past to get players nowadays"" and now that the Lakers got LeBron it's all ""he only went there because of the Lakers' name."" It gets old watching the narrative change every year.  Someone as competitive as LeBron is wouldn't have signed here if he didn't think they could compete."

"I know..Co-MVP would be the right thing to do if that happens but thats not possible with 11 voters unless one of them picks JR Smith or some shit. But I ask myself how the Lakers would do without AD or without LeBron and the honest answer is James is more important because of his IQ, passing ability, hitting that next gear, etc. AD will likely have at least one more chance to win it so I really dont see LeBron not winning..unless AD goes apeshit and averages 40 in the next 3 games."
You're one Lebron James away from an eastern conference finals appearance

"In addition to the 3 you listed, James Harden is a better PG than Kyrie. So is LeBron. Maybe even Ja Morant and Jamal Murray. He's toward the bottom of the top 10 and is a locker room cancer. These new Nets will never have good chemistry because their star players are incapable of being relatable to the rest of the team."

[Lebron James shares how finals experience has shaped his game to the point of no weakness](https://streamable.com/z3xn0n)
"I feel like LeBron gets undue credit just because he is LeBron James. If you look at his stats, they are just normal superstar numbers, but because it's LeBron people assume some other transcendental intangible factor that makes it better.  Like he orchestrates the whole game, as if that isn't true for any superstar. People act like creating shots is more important than actually making the shot. Some of his assists are just passes to a three point shooter, they are trivial passes that don't generate any added value, anyone could make them. I won't concede that making a pass should be double counted towards the points you generate, not how that works.  This pisses me off, because a couple of years ago when I tried to make a case for anyone other than Lebron, be it KD, Curry or Kobe, people always pointed to LeBron's superior stats as a reason why LBJ is the best. Now that he doesn't have the best stats, people still say he is the best because of some X-factor only he has. Can't have it both ways. AD just outplayed him yesterday."
"Here come the Kyrie stans saying ‘hE rIgHt YaLl NePhEwS’   Kyrie said he never played with a closer. He played with Lebron James, so many people find that original statement to be dumb. It’s that simple.   If DWade said he never played with a two way player before Jimmy Butler, people would clown him just as much. Stop trying to defend the guy, he said some dumb shit. This isn’t that deep."
"Confident: Bill Russell, Tim Duncan, Larry Bird, Jason Kidd  Insecure: Chris Paul, LeBron James, Shaquille O'Neal, Russell Westbrook"
"Herro and Robinson were pretty bad. Some people don't want to admit they were, but they were. That's also not something totally unexpected. Even the great LeBron James had his early NBA Finals struggles, and those two can not compare to his talent, and are younger to boot than when James had his issues.   I truly hope they both got those jitters under their belt. As a basketball fan, I want to see some competitive ball. Miami's got good coaching and good vets. I think it'll be better Game 2. They might still get swept right out, but things are going to get cleaned up.  Honestly it's the really bad turnovers that got them. They had their issues against the Cs too. But the Lakers are on another level, getting sloppy against them leads to embarrassment. As Jimmy said, they've got to be perfect to have a chance at winning.   It would be awesome IMO if Miami can get a convincing G2 victory. The best NBA Finals are those where the momentum swings and we see all the ups and downs. The narratives around it all. Blowout wins in G1 and G2 for each team would set a nice stage. Then calm it down and play it tighter. Storylines and drama man, that's why we watch. On a personal selfish note, this is the last bball we might see in a long, long time. I wanna see it go 7."
"Yeah, Lebron James and AD. I also like how we're acting like a GM who gets those two is somehow a basketball genius. You got the GOAT and potentially another generational talent on the same team."
"I just love how it takes more than a few seconds for ""LeBron James"" to show up on the screen! Extra comedic effect"
LeBron James type beat
"Another small thing that I felt like affected the game was that dumb coach's challenge. It was clearly an offensive foul but Lebron James was upset so Vogel had to burn a challenge. That extra timeout could have been useful.   Small thing in the grand scheme but either way, that challenge was dumb."
How the fuck does +\- work? Why is Danny green +14 and LeBron James is +9?
"Stats don't mean anything at the end of the day if you don't win. Would lebron rather have a 40/10/10 with no win or 28/8/8 with a win? Obviously he's going to be better looked at if he wins. If he's putting up those numbers and still can't win he's not the goat. If Lebron James with the 2nd best player in the series blow a 3-1 lead to 5th seed laker there is no way he's the goat. You don't live up to your goat reputation by scoring, the greatest of all time would not let this Heat team take him to 6, much more blow a 3-1 less."
&gt;The best career decision anyone could make is playing with LeBron James.  I guess the 0 games that Wiggins played with LeBron didn't help him that much
Hate to break it to you but I don’t think you’re in a position to say what type of player Jimmy Buckets is when he’s arguably outplaying LeBron James
"This is LeBron James we're talking about here.   The Heat still have to win two more times (in a row) to take the series.   LBJ is a master of adjustments. He's basically a play-coach. The coach would probably defer to him if he insisted on, well, anything.   LBJ took it to the Warriors (significantly better team than the heat) in 2015 without Love or Irving. He made what should have been an easy sweep pretty damn competitive with (I can't remember who). The next season he took the same team from a 1-3 deficit to a WIN against literally the most successful team in NBA regular season history.   AD or no AD, the Heat have their fucking work cut out for them."
"Lebron is taller, faster, and can jump higher than Jimmy Butler and Duncan robinson. He could get that shot off.  Also this is Lebron fucking james we’re talking about, he could make that pass to kcp in his sleep 10 out of 10 times."
"If you want to think Butler is a superstar go ahead. Don't get mad at me because I don't think your favorite player is a superstar. I don't need to define superstar. I can tell who is a superstar tho. LeBron James. Kevin Durant. Steph Curry. James Harden. Kawhi Leonard. Giannis A. Those are superstars, not little B+ Jimmy."
Lebron James was unconscious. Jimmy was excellent. I wish fans would just enjoy both performances instead of trying to compare them.
"Having the situational awareness to look at lebron James with 5 seconds left is something a player can be expected to have.  Obviously we can second guess his decision and look at it with a birds eye view.  Morris has been playing above his paygrade this playoffs, he just had a bad game and made a good offensive rebound followed by a bad decision."
Lakers have way more firepower than heat. Switch butler and lebron james and think about how things would go...
LeBron James and teammates screwing him over in the finals. Only thing that competes are Prime Felix Hernandez and his teammates screwing him over in the 9th inning
Thats dumb as hell.  Trae practically averaged 30/10 his sophomore season and thats with his #2 PNR man in prison for bad pee.  The Hawks were bottom of the league in 3P% and he was still 2nd in Assists for the whole NBA behind Lebron goddamn James  This is without even mentioning that picking him at 5 came with Cam Reddish at 10 the following year
"Oh you watched up until clutch time came around? Then you turned your tv off, waited for the result of the game, and were ready to blame whatever result on Lebron James? Unless they won of course, then lebron wouldn’t have been responsible for that, not in your eyes at least"
"As long as we limit it to this series, it's not arguable. Jimmy Butler is having a better series statistically than LeBron James, which is fucking insanity and I can think of the last time you could say that about anyone honestly.  LeBron gets more rebounds, Jimmy gets more assists and steals, Jimmy shoots slightly better and his game score is higher.  I don't have the motivation to go back and look, but I wonder when was the last time that someone had a statically better series than LeBron. (Now that I've said it, LeBron is going for like 50/20/20 next game just to shut down the discussion.)"
"""Clam down. Don't speak up about that might affect our money, especially you Daryl Morey! Human rights come second to my earnings!""  -LeBron James probably"
"What teams has he been on that has talent on the level of AD, Lebron James, and Dwight Howard? That’s literally 3 first ballot HOFers, and Rondo has a shot down the line too. The literal only HOF obvious player Jimmy has played with in his career is Pau Gasol."
"Lebron and Vogel would disagree with you there, they both asked for him https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/4/1/21201797/lakers-news-danny-green-lebron-james-development-leadership-cleveland-cavaliers-teammates  “He’s a winner. He’s a champion. He’s a perfect complement, really, to both of those guys,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel says.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/2/27/21154548/danny-green-lebron-james-lakers-kawhi-leonard-tim-duncan"
"If your intentions to drive with 10 seconds left is to kick it to one of your unreliable 3 point shooters with a few seconds left then you’re not playing ball correctly. He got all the way to the bucket &amp; could have attempted a contested layup (that ive seen him make 100000 times) or at the very least get fouled. Idc how “high percentage” the look was for Danny green, he’s ass. You’re Lebron James you take the results of this game into your own hands. He had a phenomenal game but he just fucked up big time tonight."
"lol Lebron/Vogel asked for Green to be here https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/4/1/21201797/lakers-news-danny-green-lebron-james-development-leadership-cleveland-cavaliers-teammates  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/2/27/21154548/danny-green-lebron-james-lakers-kawhi-leonard-tim-duncan   2) That's infamously called the ""Pat Riley Used Cadillac trade"" I forgot if it was Shaq or Charles Barkley that tagged it we knew the guy had reached his ceiling and wasn't Heat material with all the strip club scandals he had here, idk how he's doing up there in Portland you guys have more stirp clubs than Miami."
"It's plays like those that make you really appreciate LeBron James because what looks like ""common sense"" passes just don't register for players.   They don't see the field like he does. Kind of akin to Messi and how he seems to have ""TV-vision"" of the field when he passes."
No because theres gonna be the JIMMY BUTLER LEBRON JAMES EPIC FINALS DUEL - Game 5 2020 video
those Thibs years of running him to the ground are paying off. dude played 47 min and looked more in shape then LeBron fucking James
"He legit had a fairly open KCP, a wide open Danny Green, and a wide open LeBron fucking James to pass to, but instead decides to just throw the ball out of bounds in the general direction of Davis as if he was a QB about to get sacked"
LeBron James
"One thing that won’t get appreciated in the “duel” between Butler and James.  Butler was essentially getting to iso 1v1 against  Morris due to the Heat’s spacing. LeBron was constantly seeing 2-3-4 bodies in the paint.   That’s not to say Butler wasn’t fantastic, he certainly was. But James’ effort was Herculean. Such a shame it’ll probably be forgotten due to the atrocious finish by LeBron’s teammates."
Jimmy Butler and Lebron James. Thank you for that show

Lebron James - Questionable (ankle pain)
In my ideal world Lebron James balls the fuck out every game and the lakers still lose in 7.
yeah they are lebron james and anthony davis
"Lebron James is not Chinese. As a private American citizen, it is not his job to condemn China. It would be great if he would because China is the worst, but he doesn't have to.   Calling him selfish when he literally funded a school to help further the educationan for at risk kids is what shows how daft you are being.   You refuse to see past your unwarranted hate for Lebron. I hated him as a player when he was on the Heat because of what he did to the Celtics, but I am not 12 and can see that he is a great man on and off the court."
"Weird comment. Everyone here watched the game, it is the NBA finals, not some pickup game. You do not have a damn monopoly on having watched the NBA finals. You saying Lebron wanted no part of Butler is ridiculous when he was his primary defender. I didn't say only defender, I said primary. Obviously Lebron didn't guard Butler when he was on the damn bench. He was, absolutely the guy who started off on Butler most of the time. This is Lebron James, I seriously doubt he, or a lot of the other guys out there really, are scared to guard anybody. What happened, and you saw this because you watched the game, was Lebron kept getting switched off of Butler."
"FOH with that pussy shit. We got LeBron James and you're quitting before game 6  Duncan Robinson isn't dropping 25+ with 7 3s made next game, it took a miracle game from a rookie for them to win a 1-possession game.   Jimmy's performance isn't a surprise for a player of his level but their role players played almost perfect and ours played like they want to make twitter takes true."
Jimmy Butler is out there forging a legacy. Unbelievable win in a 1v1 title fight against LeBron James locked in on the ultimate prize.
"Damn right we did. But we didn't think he was going to be ""I'M GOING TO GO TOE TO TOE WITH LEBRON FUCKING JAMES"" good."
"You're acting like it's extremists only, sorry but in China it's not just  extremist muslim that are sent there. There's around 20 millions muslim in China and the estimate is 1 million detained. Don't tell me that 1/20 muslim in china is a terrorist. It's plain and simple brainwashing, so if we take my example, it's not the cult like church that we take it like you said, we're literally taking 1/20 christian in san antonio. Literally all the sources says it's around 1 million in concentration camps btw, so literally give me proof that it's not 1 million or stop saying ""but it's not millions""  Now when you talk about Ted cruz and Tom cotton hyping it up or making it bigger than it is, sure. But at the end of the day they don't matter, what actually matters is what is going on in china in those camps which is wrong. The CCP is breaking human rights, they are controlling their population(not talking about muslim only).   As for Lebron, he didn't nail it, he called morey uneducated about the situation when in reality he was clearly educated and calling out China on what they are doing is the right call. Like I said earlier, if Lebron didn't want to take a stand, it's fine but don't call Morey uneducated when he's calling out a country for breaking fucking human rights. It's literally just as bad as defending trump for what he did with ICE and the illegal immigrant, which some are kids born in this country from parents that didn't have their papers(the illegal ones).   Here's the quote of what Lebron said :       “I think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could tweet or could say (could affect people),” James said. “We all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others, and you’re only thinking about yourself.      “I don’t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.”  Also the things you said about the mega church in the usa has literally nothing to do with this and even with all they did, I would never wish for them to go into concentration camps to get brainwashed and tortured. That's completely another subject but the people in charge of those church not following the covid laws instaured should be in jail but again we're not talking about concentration camps or anything related to the subject. Honestly I have no idea why you brought them up in this discussion."
LeBron James - Out (broken hand)
Jimmy Butler and Lebron James had a badass off and it was amazing to watch
"People can say what they want about ""Three guys in the paint and Danny Green is open, Lebron made the right basketball play,"" but I call bullshit. You're telling me Lebron James of all people doesn't get the call if he goes up for the shot there and gets the tiniest of grazes?   Bullshit."
"They should have, that was an all time ass performance by a supporting cast, a 6 point play? Holy fuck  Danny Green needs to go  Marqueef tossed a fucking LOB to AD while Lebron James is wide open"
"Hey all I can say is if that trashy cheating scumbag lebron gets a ring with the l.a faker trash team he's on I'm basically done with the nba and Adam silver can choke on a big fat horse d**k for selling out the league and screwing it up like he has. Hey wanna win a ring free and easy. It's as simple as being a communist supporting piece of trash ala lebron and whine and moan untill you get some real talant too support you, and of course the nba won't do jack because Adam silvers stuffed so far between lebron's cooch and zi jinpings but cheeks he can't see reason or the light of day. Bottom line as a player lebron james is a cheap cheating scumbag whiny b***h and can screw himself."
LeBron James being the Anti-Space Jam Jordan: sapping his own teammate's skills to make himself better
Real talk this man played 47 minutes today leading and facilitating the offense AND leading scoring by himself AND defending a mix of Lebron James and Anthony Davis.  This man is the real fucking deal.
Man really had his redemption arc served to him on a silver platter by LeBron James and he puked all over it
Y'all will be good you have lebron james
Should-be 10x NBA MVP Lebron James loses another
"Truth. I'm honestly only half joking - I wouldn't even blink it it happened, it's goddamn LeBron James.  He's already one of the best passers/floor generals ever - as he ages/moves away from the paint and starts focusing purely on shooting, I could absolutely see him being a nightmare on the perimeter."
"Tbh it should have been a James Butler iso. Mano a Mano. But anybody other than Green for that screen was the best option. Like he building houses out here. Morris has 3 open passes. A bounce to AD, kick back to Green who could throw it to AD overhead better or swing to Bron, or look behind and see LeBron was going to the 3 pt line."
"Watch the play again and tell me it wasn't the same smothering coverage he scored on the previous two times down the floor. No doubt tough shot, but its lebron fucking james.  I don't blame him for the loss, that's on the non-existent supporting cast, but he should take the teams destiny into his own hands, and he had a chance."
I don’t think it’s that simple. Butler drew a bunch more fouls than LeBron all season long (9 to 6 per game). This Finals isn’t unusual by that standard. Unless it’s some season long conspiracy to keep James down.
"Lebron, Ad, giannis, curry, KD, James harden, kawhi Leonard, Damien lillard, Jokic, Joel embiid"
It took Lebron James making 3’s to keep LA in it also.
"I think Lebron James, like other adults is aware of how much he is taxed. Something makes me feel as if you wouldn't ask this question about Kyle Korver.   Either way, you initially called Lebron selfish and said all he cares about is money. I don't think a selfish man builds an inner city school, that provides at-risk kids with a free ride to a local college."
That lone block was also a stuff on LeBron James in the 4th quarter
It took the Heat having a perfect game and everyone not named Lebron James/AD/KCP (who missed a few clutch shots down the stretch) to lose by 3. I don't think Duncan Robinson scoring 20+ points is more sustainable than Lebron scoring 30+ points
"Lebron james aint gonna lose at game 7.  If you think Duncan Robinson making those threes that he make today on game 7, you trippin."
LeBron James Butler
"LeBron James and trying to force a bunch of scrubs to greatness, name a more iconic basketball duo."
LeBron James Butler
BREAKING: Markieff Morris (currently being brutally beaten by Lebron James with a bar of soap in a sock) doubtful for Game 6
"You can't tell me he wants it more than LeBron. LeBron was just as spent, did just as much, and has just as much on the line. I have gained a whole new respect for Butler for sure, but James didn't take a play off tonight. He left it on the floor, too."
Lebron James is gonna stab someone tonight
For real. Favorite moment was when KCP had that clutch defensive play then hit a 3 on the other end and Mark Jackson was like “what a good pass by Lebron James”.   They were just shoving that narrative down everyone’s throat.   I’m like Lebron’s playing an amazing game and has plenty of highlights on his own! No need to give him credit for other people’s plays.   Just gets exhausting.
"Lebron James in the locker room working on his Prezi for game 6. Titled: ""Where are my 40+ FT Refs? I swear to God""  https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2020-09-23/lakers-nuggets-game-four"
"Literally a clock the other end of the court so that's a shit excuse. They had 16 seconds for the possession and LeBron had drove straight away and passed out. He clearly knew there was enough time or he'd have shot it.  I always agree of James' philosophy of trust your teammates, but this is literally almost the definition of why you back yourself to take a last second shot to win it."
"Incredible game. From start to finish, two teams firing on all cylinders offensively, both absolutely desperate to take the win. LeBron James 15-20, 40-13-7 - and loses. He felt like 2016 LeBron again tonight.  But what about the Miami Heat. Missing their leading scorer - i.e the guy that had scored the most points for them in the entire playoffs!!!! - they force a game 6 against all odds. Against the people such as myself who said the finals were ""dead"". Against the analysts and pundits and talking heads who have been putting the crown on the Lakers head since the dispatched the aaesome Nuggets in game. Against the casual dumbass fans who say the Heat making the finals means nothing because the East is"" weak"".   Unbelievable credit to every single player, to Eric Spolestra, and to Jimmy fucking Butler. Whatever happens on Sunday, they will go down as legends. And probably the most beloved finals underdog in at least a decade."
BREAKING: Markieff Morris (currently being brutally beaten by Lebron James) doubtful for Game 6
I feel like Lebron is so physical on his drives that the refs permit some contact from the defense because he’s just barreling down the lane.   Jimmy is just a maestro at drawing fouls. He always he’s his forearms and elbows positioned perfectly to catch contact from a defender. I respect it; he’s not a total flopper like James Harden.
"So LeBron James is WIDE OPEN and Markieff Morris, the worst passer in the history of the sport, tries to throw a lob with 6 seconds left to Davis instead of make the easy pass? Amazing game but that low IQ bs ruined my entire weekend."
"LeBron James went 40-13-7 and still lost a finals game. My god what more can this man take like. As a person who watches from Ireland and rarely gets to see games, that’s gotta be one of his best games in a finals game?"
"&gt;Close out James? Who?  Literally carried the team on his back, gave a guy a perfect opportunity to be a hero and he bricked. Imagine blaming LeBron for not being a closer in this game."
"Championship clinching possession. LeBron James has taken over offensively and is scoring every single possession.   Down 1 with the clock winding down....  Does he drive to the basket and try and score and draw the foul and clinch the series?   No, he kicks it out to Danny fucking Green who nearly air balls and Morris lobs into the seats to lose it.   LeBron should have taken that shot. Could have been a career highlight.   If Miami is able to win game 6, they’re gonna win this series. Davis is banged up and LeBron can’t do it alone. Miami has a better overall roster. This was Lebrons best game of the season and they still lost.   Miami really might fuck around and come back. This subreddit is going to crash Reddit’s servers if Lebrons lakers choke a 3-1 lead 😂😂😂😂"
"Counting Lebron James out before game 6? Bold move, Cotton, let's see if it pays off"
Danny Green really had his redemption arc served to him on a silver platter by LeBron James and he puked all over it

"LeBron James, putting teams on his back just to be let down by his supporting cast."
I don’t want to overreact but do you think best player of all time rankings is now: 1.	Jimmy Butler 2.	LeBron James 3.	Michael Jordan
Lebron James with the fucking .75-.66-.75 shooting splits. I love the dude but he needs to hit his free throws.
"For me, we lost this game because of 1 specific reason: the other guys were either unwilling or mentally incapable of stepping up and helping LeBron James and Anthony Davis offensively. There’s only so much that our two stars can do, and we definitely lost this game by no fault of theirs. LeBron did everything humanly possible to will this team to victory, but the rest of the guys (minus AD, and KCP) did not want to win.  Jimmy Butler was dominant. Duncan Robinson looked like the second coming of Reggie Miller. It is what it is.  Danny Green is a fucking embarrassment. That mistake by Morris is one of the worst ones in the history of the NBA finals. I never want to see them play for the Lakers ever again after this series."
"Lebron James currently making a Prezi in the locker room for the refs. Titled: ""Why the fuck do I not get 40+ FT a game?"""
Shaqtin - imagine trying to watch a Lebron James Classic game in the future only for it to end like this lol.
"He panicked, didn’t see lebron James wide open."
What a waste of a transcendent performance by LeBron James with 40 13 and 7 on 70% shooting 😞. If only markeif passed to him at the end instead of throwing it to nobody.

"""Lebron James selectively supports protests that personally help him, shits on other protests if they threaten his money, and uses social issues to divert attention away from class issues""  Trump may be right, but not in the way he thinks he is right.

Anthony Davis and Lebron James cannot win without help. The rest of the Lakers are fucking bums. L.A. Street Department strikes again.
I am not feeling well right now after that heartbreaker of a game.   Jimmy Butler vs Lebron James was a battle for the ages. If only Morris made that pass.
What an embarrassing loss. Lmao. How many times has a Lebron James teammate shit the bed in the last 15secs? He needs to stop passing to anyone in that spot.
"This is why LeBron is my GOAT. MJ can be better than him for 95% of the season, but when it comes to those last 3 or 4 games in a playoff series when your back is up against the wall there's no other player I would want more on my team than LeBron Raymone James."
"The real question is what if LeBron was drafted by Detroit   That team went to 6 ECF  They still would have the pieces to make the Sheed deal   Chauncey/Lindsey Hunter    Rip / Mike James   LeBron / Tayshaun Prince   Sheed / Okur   Ben Wallace   That team took the Spurs to Game 7 and had a lead until the 4th quarter so a few minutes away from going back to back   Imagine if they got LeBron that’s game over   They could easily turn around and package Prince up for someone bc he wouldn’t be needed any longer and his value was high after they won in 2004.   Would have been a dynasty easily 3-4 chips or more   How would you score with that kind of suffocating defense AND LeBron?  And add in the fact that the Pistons biggest issue was consistent scoring every night. Rip, Chauncey, Okur, and Sheer are all better than average three point shooters and would feast playing next to Bron.   That team was focused in with an all time great in Larry Brown as coach the sky would have been the limit.   If LeBron was drafted by Detroit he easily wins 2-3 rings in his first 6 years in the league.   He would easily eclipse Jordan for rings and Finals MVP trophies   The truth is if the Pistons take Wade or Bosh they win minimum 2 and up to 4 but they took darko and that was history"

"tbh, its a lot better than reading some dumbshit post from some warriors fan crying about lebron james. this was a breath of fresh air."
1. LeBron James 2. Michael Jordan 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. Magic Johnson 5. Wilt Chamberlain  6. Larry Bird 7. Shaquille O'Neal 8. Kobe Bryant 9. Tim Duncan 10. Bill Russell
He won more games against the Golden State Warriors than Lebron James did in the playoffs that year.
"They're not similarly good as scorers at all, but I think we both know that. A second option who barely scored at league average efficiency (that plummeted without LeBron James) on a trash offense is not the same as a primary option scoring at league average efficiency on a decent to good offense. We saw Siakam as a second/third option last season and he was way, way better than Kuzma in a similar position.  Kuzma's role on offence was reduced even further this season and he was completely unimpressive. There's no reason to believe that he'd be remotely as effective as Pascal Siakam if he were to replace him."
Can I have a Miami heat Lebron James if you can do that if not put jimmy butler
" ""*LeBron* James is well on his way. If he wins one more \[championship\], Michael and him are going to be right there together,""   \- Magic Johnson"
"If he was wearing a mask, how do we know it was LeBron James?!?! Anyone could've traveled to Miami for that game."
Kyle Kuzma put up those numbers as the second/third option on a team with a dogshit offense and his numbers completely plummeted without LeBron James on the court.   Pascal Siakam was our first option this season and still put up better stats. It truly is laughable to even consider comparing the two.
"international fans who don't have allegiance baggage. Lebron James joins ""my team"", I'll just change my team."
"....If you have LeBron James....he's a big part of your game plan.  Are you trolling?  LeBron James never missed a playoff game and Lue never missed the playoffs.  Who cares if they lost a few regular season games?  The Clips are already a joke, this is the least of their problems.  You take any star out of any coach's rotation and it changes their game plan drastically, none more so than LeBron."
With LeBron playing in the West now that's not going to hold up. Just this year alone LeBron played   - Damian Lillard - James Harden - Russell Westbrook - Nikola Jokic  - Jamal Murray
probably traded for lebron james/stephen curry types
"Chris Paul, Paul George. Paul Paul.  George Gervin, Paul George. George George.  Davis Bertans, Anthony Davis. Davis Davis   Leonard Taylor, Meyers Leonard.

Bradley Bradley  Duncan Robinson, Tim Duncan. Duncan Duncan  Christian Wood, Bob Christian. Christian Christian."
"It doesn't fit the narrative that LeBron James, social justice and Black people are destroying the NBA so it won't be mentioned."
"It's not just this sub. Kerr himself said he thought the 17 team was much better than the 16 team, so has Zach Lowe and some of his guests on his podcasts as well.   It's not that big of a stretch. The 2017 Cavs were not much worse on defense (they turned it up in the post-season after fucking around in the regular season) but were miles better on offense. Literally breaking multiple offensive playoff records in their run.  &gt;“The team that I think may have been their best team was the team we beat in five in 2017,” Kerr said. “I thought that team was better than the one in 2016 that beat us. Difference was, we had Kevin.”  &gt;“But Kyrie had fully blossomed into Kyrie by ’16, LeBron (James) was at the height of his powers, Love was healthy and rolling, JR (Smith) did his job defensively. They shot so many 3s. Didn’t they make 25 threes in Game 4? That series was some of the highest level of basketball ever player in the spot. It was higher level than ’16.”  No offense but I take these guys' opinion in much higher regard than some random on here who thinks a team is overrated because of rather meaningless regular season statistics."
"Okay first of all, that was one game. Second of all he had a higher TS% than Lebron that game. So go trash him too for that. Third the ""Stagnant"" offense was from him being doubled all  the time because Westbrook is trash. You based your whole defense around Westbrook(and Rivers) sucking and it worked. Its not Harden's fault his teammates couldnt capitalize on 4v3. Off ballmovement? Who do you want getting James the ball? Westbrook LOL? Gordon? Rivers? Oh yea they are all fantastic passers huh? You have no good argument here. And Harden is an amazing player....sheesh.  How did anyone upvote this......holy hell."
"LeBron James for Gary Harris, Will Barton, Monte Morris, and Keita Bates-Diop"

"I don’t like Lebron. But only because his teams always take my teams out of the playoffs. I actually admire him as a person for the most part.I respect Lebron James. He’s been the greatest player of this generation/era. I say it’s hard to argue players in different decades due to rules changing and overall player skill improving, as well as a few other reasons, but Lebron is possibly the best player ever (it’s hard to compare now to sometime like the 60s).   So if he came to my team I’d be happy but I’d also expect at the very least a finals appearance so if that didn’t happen I’d be pretty upset.   Blazer and Celtic fan, FYI."
"&gt;He's a stat stuffing ""star"", not a contributor to a winning team.  Even if this were true, its doesnt matter because LeBron James."
"Some 2015 onwards Warriors fans and some Clipper fans I know are like this. Bailed on the Lakers just because 1. They weren't contenders from 2014-2018/2019 and 2. They will never accept the idea of LeBron James playing for the Lakers and ""trampling on Kobe's city""  If you'd ask me, team first. I don't really care who they sign as long as he helps the team win another chip and doesn't create issues in the locker room or within the organization as a whole. Also, why wouldn't I want a Top 1-3 all time player who still happens to be at that transcendent talent level playing for the team I'm rooting for?"
No. All the hype is because he’s lebron james jr
"Half of the hype is because Lebron James is his father. He’s probably a good prospect, but I don’t see him being anywhere *near* the top of his grade. He has a pretty stacked team too with players who are definitely better than him, but he gets the spotlight more because of Lebron. Sorta like Edwards basically being the consensus best player from college, but a lot of nba fans who don’t watch college but know about the Ball family think Lamelo is better, even though he’s not."
"I mean LeBron doesn't actually say stuff that's politically controversial at all. And if you consider his More than a Vote campaign and advocation of Civil rights as ""cringe""  then I think the problem is more with you than with him. He's done real change, and I respect that immensely, imagine LeBron James bringing about more positive change to local communities than that states congressmen (ohio)."
"Yes by the end of Game 1, Kyrie was out. Love was out before the series. Yet, the Cavs still managed to get a 2-1 lead without those two players. 2-1 lead with LeBron James, and they proceeded to lose 3 games in a row. 2 of them were at home. Games 4, 5, and 6 Ty Lue was outcoached. Kerr made adjustments like starting Iggy, when he had been the 6th man all year. Lue was a deer in the headlights."
Even at 35 LeBron James is still the better lacrosse player
Pretty easy when you have Lebron James on your team.
This sub would go insane at a naked Lebron James
"I think GSW has made your mind change about what a superteam truly is. GSW with KD was absurd. They were a level beyond superteam. But are you really going to sit up there and say having two MVP players on a team (one possible Goat) isn't a superteam? It absolutely is. Kobe and Shaq were a superteam. So was Magic and Kareem's Lakers.   I was just pointing to the dude's reasoning on hating LeBron James. Most of Lakers rings have been due to super teams. Where was the hate then?   As for what Reddit has been saying all year, I am not responsible for it. As far as I was concerned, Lakers were the better team simply because LeBron is better than Kawhi and AD is much much better than PG. PG is a Bosch level player, not AD, or Kawhi or LeBron."
"Exactly. Let us appreciate lebron james, lionel messi, floyd mayweather, novak djokovic, khabib nurmagomedov, and Alex caruso live while we still can"
"I guess I just enjoy basketball differently than you. Winning is not the end-all be-all for me. I just like following a team as it's built, watching them grow together, seeing how the gm works to build a good team. I've been following this Celtics team closely since IT was an MVP candidate, and I feel like it wouldn't be fun if the team progress was destroyed by adding Lebron James, even if it would make us way better."
"Fun fact: I worked for a company that partnered with Google+ (remember when that was a thing) and set up profiles for a few NBA players. For LeBron James, I found a picture of him playing the violin, which I thought was silly, so I included it as his profile picture. For a year or two while Google was really pushing their platform, they would use people’s profiles as the default image that game up when you searched a player. I wonder if LeBron ever inspired anyone to take up a string instrument..."
“LeBron James is scary of us”.... my ass
"LeBron “billion dollar lifetime deal with Nike, already owns a part of another sports franchise, and has always talked about owning a basketball team” James would never"
Yeah and every other is also some stupid shit like LEBRON JAMES IS THE ONLY PLAYER IN NBA HISTORY TO KISS ANTHONY DAVIS ON THE CHEEKS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF GAME 6 IN THE NBA FINALS
"Damn, the LeBron James Haters UNITED page is still alive and kicking (not as much as during its heyday but still pretty active)"
Lebron James. Not even close
LeBron James was on a mission that night.  Clearly unstoppable!
"Probably my favorite sports article ever.         &gt;Lebron James ran over 18,000 people.     Gets me every time lol"
LeBron James is the goat.
James of the LeBron
And this is why LeBron James is the goat.
How are James Harden and LeBron not two of the thicker players in the league? Where is Jae Crowder?  These teams are lying.
"&gt; This is the sort of package you send for a prime LeBron, not James Harden  No it's not.  DEN would probably be able to remove Murray but add Jokic and draft capital to get a guy like LeBron."
"There are slightly under 500 players under contract in NBA, and only 1 Lebron James"
"Denver, definitely says no. They're better than the Rockets right now, Murray, MPJ, Bol and Porter are all under team control for 5-7 years, are younger than Harden and have room to improve.  This is the sort of package you send for a prime LeBron, not James Harden."
"If they made the deal outlined in the article this is probably what their roster would look like before ever even approaching anyone in free agency (they would still have the MLE, BAE and vet mins):  * C - Dwight Howard, Boogie Cousins (re-signed)  * PF - Anthony Davis, Jared Dudley (re-signed)  * SF - LeBron James, Talen Horton-Tucker  * SG - KCP, Alex Caruso  * PG - Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo (re-signed)  Maybe they could convince Markieff Morris to come back, but otherwise they'd probably try to go after someone like Mo Harkless or possibly even Melo I guess."
LeBron James couldn't lead the (current) Hawks (minus Trae) to the playoffs.
lebron james got defended by jj barea and outplayed by a 33 year old jason terry  jordan averaged 40 ppg vs a lineup starting 4 hall of famers
James Jones. Dude was with lebron in all those miami and late cavs years
"That’s fair about Giannis. I’m comparing their postseason ability to their regular season ability though. After Mike D’antoni arrived in Houston, James Garden’s usage &amp; stats/production rose much more in his favor relative to his team’s success. I honestly believe that if Steph or Dame were in that system, they’d have similar or potentially greater production.  Conversely, I look at players like Butler or, going back in history, Ginobli and Pippen as players who are capable of putting up all-time great stats but would so at the relative expense of collective team success. With Butler, I have him up this high cuz I believe in him for the future and will stop sleeping on him. He’s not just a defensive stopper, an all-star, or a top 15 player—he’s a true superstar.  Getting back to Giannis, I think Jokic could legit be above him, but I think I’d use an argument similar for why Lebron was still considered (in my opinion) a top 5 player after 2011. He had the worst finals performance of any superstar ever, but I still felt he was capable of playing like a champion in the same way that he did in 2007 ECF. I guess I’m relying more on Giannis’s 2019 postseason before losing 4 straight to the raptors in the ECF as well tbh.  One thing I’ll say that may bring Giannis lower is that he’s in the East and has an excellent regular season coach in Mike Budenholzer that has a system similarly built around him. As a result, it’s possible his stats are a bit inflated, but I’d just look at his usage and considering he plays &lt;31 minutes per game, I feel his production is more representative of his true ability.  Feel free to respond to any of these points. This is great barbershop talk, and I’m always happy to participate &amp; listen (even if my opinion isn’t the most popular)."
"In addition to what you said, we also have to take into account that because Jordan came first, there was no pressure on him and everyone was rooting for him because there was really nothing to chase.  LeBron on the other hand had skeptics from as soon as he entered the league, and has had to deal with immense pressure, particularly losing after 2011. No one has had to deal with the pressure LeBron James has dealt with.   Would be interesting to see LeBron dealing with none and have everyone rooting for him and Jordan being scrutinized by a majority of the NBA fanbase day in and day out."
Lebron James. He will do it in the last game of his career five years later. Mark my words.
"I think Lebron may be more likable off court. On court no way. The South Beach thing. Coughing at Dirk then losing to him. Calling himself the GOAT constantly without the stats to back it up. “When you wake up you’re still you and I’m Lebron James”. Whining after every single call (which has gotten wayyyy worse lately). His on court ego is intolerable to a lot of people.   Funny Jordan seems like the opposite. During games and in the media he was a class act and pro, off court seems like where most of his issues lied."
"Lmao, I mean I respectfully disagree.   LeBron James, DRose, Kyrie Irving all have sick logos.  It just so happens Curry's logo is absolute trash."
"I just want to preface that I value playoff performance VERY heavily. So I got people who perform a little disappointing, not choking just not super duper playoff performers, a little lower.  1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Anthony Davis 5. Nikola Jokic 6. Luka Doncic 7. Giannis Antetokounmpo 8. James Harden 9. Jimmy Butler 10. Damian Lillard  I refuse to put Durant on the list. Dunno if he'll be ready and healthy, and this is coming from a Nets fan. If we talking healthy Durant he right above Steph. If we talking 75% Durant right next to Harden. Anything lower makes him fall out top 10. And btw Jokic &amp; Doncic are legitimately tied for me. I just like Jokic a lot more so I gave him the nod."
Based on what? He's only coached two full seasons. And he was winless in his only season as a head coach without LeBron James.
"No, but he was definitively better imo considering the playoff birth.   https://www.sportscasting.com/why-carmelo-anthony-should-have-beaten-lebron-james-for-nba-rookie-of-the-year-in-2004/"
"A role player on a championship level team.   I don't understand why people expect Kuzma to start when the two forwards in front of him in the depth chart are Lebron James and Anthony Davis.   Kuzma imo played solid all year and gets a lot of undeserved shit. I'll add that I think Tatum is obviously better at this point, but Kuzma on his own is a good player."
You left out the part about LeBron James.
"1. LeBron James  2. Steph Curry  3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden  5. Anthony Davis  6. Luka Doncic  7. Nikola Jokic  8. Giannis Antetokounmpo  9. Damian Lillard  10. Joel Embiid  HM: Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum"
1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Garnett 3. Stephen Curry 4. Kevin Durant 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. James Harden 8. Dwight Howard 9. Anthony Davis 10. Derrick Rose
"From later in the article  &gt; The fans were so shell-shocked that many (including me and my father) filed out with three minutes remaining, not because we were lousy fans, not to beat the traffic, but because we didn’t want to be there anymore. We wanted to get away from LeBron. He ruined what should have been a magical night. We never really had a chance to cheer, swing the game, rally our guys, anything. He pointed a remote control at us and pressed “MUTE.” It was like being in a car accident. LeBron James ran over 18,000 people.  https://grantland.com/features/the-consequences-caring/  Everyone should read it, his best work imo"
"So, other than in ancient history when Golden State won titles, they’ve been pretty barren in the modern era, much like Cleveland.   LeBron James made Cleveland relevant among the winners of today’s game and they’ve pretty gone back to shit in his two absences. Likewise, the Splash Bros and Dray have taken Golden State and turned them from afterthought to Aftermath.   The scenery doesn’t really match up with Golden State being in the California Bay Area and all, but for me it’s as close as it gets."
&gt; 28/10/4 on insane efficiency while playing HOF defense as a big  playing next to... lebron fucking james LOL
Lebron James in 13 and 14 finals was animal. He was at his athletic peak.
Jimmy isn’t the goat and he managed to beat a super team twice. The fact the great lebron James couldn’t win one game is sad
"||||||| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Player|Age|FG%|3P%|FT%|TS%| |Kobe Bryant|21|.367|.200|.909|.411| |LeBron James|22|.356|.200|.690|.428|   This whole ""shooting like Kobe"" narrative for LeBron's first Finals series was bollocks from the start. And Kobe was the 2nd option where the entire team collapsed on Shaq."
"Yeah, if those odds are right 4-9 clearly better. I saw a site that had 2-9 though which would put Luka back at 1.   Oddshark using Bovada saying  * Luka Doncic +450 * Anthony Davis	+550 * Giannis Antetokounmpo +650 * Stephen Curry +650 * LeBron James	+900 * Kevin Durant	+900 * Jayson Tatum	+1000 * James Harden	+1200 * Damian Lillard	+1600 * Kawhi Leonard+2000"
"Hot take: Ty Lue is a good coach and will be seen as amazing until the clippers blow a 3-1 lead again but this time in the western conference finals.  Homer Take: James Harden has been absolutely stunning in the playoffs and regular season, and those alluding to a drop off in stats seem to expect him to average 40 points per game. He isn't Lebron, but neither is anyone else.   Flanders Take: While I agree that there was something up with Morey resigning when he did, I think the Rockets are fine. The guys they put in charge are Morey's guys and the owner seems to be having Morey help with the coaching search. No matter the reasoning for what happened, and even if I don't like it, I think the front office is in competent hands for the time being. We are not fucked."
Lol! All you’re proving is that he was the same quality of player. The Davis and his Pelicans had far less performance (wins) as a team all those years. He was always great.  And no player makes use of analytics more than LeBron James. So your argument that he had LeBron also means he had the power or using analytics. You’re arguing against yourself friend.
"You spend 50-100$ to see your favorite team playing the lakers. The prices are jacked up because Lebron. You’ve never seen Lebron play in person before and you’re excited  As you enter the arena you get an alert on your phone. “Lebron James listed out - load management”  I guess watching him cheer his team on the sidelines is cool tho.  End of the day these players are entertainers and paying money to see a specific player who doesn’t play always stings. I don’t have a good solution or answer to the negatives of both options - to manage or not, but it still stings."
"Yeah, 538's Raptor doesn't know how to account for Lebron James. He's an outlier that doesn't fit their system."
"LeBron James' Taco Tuesday Taqueria, Tequila &amp; Tapas.  Coming to where TGI Fridays used to be near you!!!"
"It's not like LeBron-ball is similar to the Spurs beautiful game. There have been reports that LeBron's own teammates were sometimes upset with his level of ball dominance (https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/01/13/report-cavaliers-have-grumbled-about-lebron-james-hunting-assists/) -- just because the possession ends with an assist doesn't mean that it was good team basketball. As another example, when Wilt was called selfish he proceeded to lead the league in assists by selfishly hunting for assists in a way that hurt his team overall. Also, Jordan's willingness to play within the triangle depressed his individual assist numbers, but led to great team success."
"Scottie Pippen, 2011  &gt; “Michael Jordan may be the greatest scorer to ever play the game, but I may go so far as to say LeBron James is the greatest player to ever play the game.”"
"Lmao, got nothing but respect for LeBron James. 2nd greatest basketball player to ever play the game.  His fans however? Yeah im the biggest hater alive of the Lakers fanbase and Bron stans. Guilty there."
"He has one less than Lebron James. Think about that when you try to post your stupid comments calling him the ""GOAT""."
"I'm saying you think analytics literally puts LeBron James on your team, because that's the biggest difference between NOLA AD and Lakers AD."
"Again you’ve got your causality mixed up. LeBron James uses analytics in adapting his game, making his shot selection, and and defensive decisions. So does CP3 and any other smart player. The analytics revolution already happened. It’s now fully integrated into the NBA."
"Is this a joke?  AD was playing next to fucking lebron James, his backup point guard was fucking rondo, he literally had playmakers out the ass to run the offense and feed him looks  Kawhi created so many buckets on his own, Toronto would’ve gotten smacked by philly with ad instead of Kawhi"
"You don't need an insider to see this.  Many former teammates say the same thing.  He may be a star on the field, but he doesn't have the charisma of a LeBron James, a Stephen Curry, an Anthony Davis, or even a Kevin Durant."
"Oh, so analytics gives you LeBron James."
"huh, i tried to find the quote of Kawhi saying “I am better than LeBron James”. didn’t find anything, ill keep looking tho...   ..also i hope you’re not talking about the ‘this is his city’ commercial, its a *commercial* made by a *marketing team* to generate *attention*"
"my guards would be Jason Kidd and Michael Jordan, forwards Lebron James and Dennis Rodman. No choice but to put Chris Webber at C for the modern NBA, but could easily swap in Joakim Noah.    I also got Stephen A Smith just don't know where to put him lmao"
"&gt; three championships in a row   LMFAO totally baseless assumption. He doesn’t have the skillset needed to lead a realistically constructed championship team.   Defensive players who rely so heavily on assisted buckets can’t lead championship teams in the modern NBA, which is why he struggled to win 35 games consistently (lmao) and why the Lakers were total dogshit without LeBron James. You’re straight up just not in contention without a high level ball hander around Davis."
“I’m too unintelligent to understand the concept of averages and sample sizes”  I guess LeBron wasn’t even a top five player on 2011 ‘cause of one bad playoff series lmfao. This is the level of brain dead analysis you’re using.  &gt; dudes had like 2 great playoff runs   Anthony Davis had two total playoff runs in seven seasons before teaming up with LeBron James LMFAO
"Again you’re correct, but any intelligent basketball fan that’s watched LeBron James play basketball, could not possibly think of him as just an athlete. I think people discount how difficult it is to win a championship. And you are correct that people  especially discount it where LeBron is concerned because of the physical advantage he had early in his career. What was he suppose to do? Not bully his way to the rim even though he could? It takes time to learn to be a professional and to win championships. No-one comes in the league leading teams to titles. He was doing as good as anyone could do early in his career, especially with the tools he was given. So those people that discounted LeBron or still do, either purposefully do so, or know nothing about basketball. Every mark of greatness people set for him he meets it, and exceeds it. Some people just are Jordan or Kobe stans and will never acknowledge the greatness of LeBron. Doesn’t mean he isn’t."
These lakers absolutely make the playoffs without AD.   It's LeBron fucking James.   It only took him getting hurt to not make the playoffs for the first time in years.
LeBron James is such a smart player.  He has been able to adapt to the changing game in the NBA while staying on top for 17 seasons.  The King.
"I’ve always said Robert Horry is better than Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and KAJ, and I stick to it"
Poor LeBron James Harden Jr. will be spending righteous bucks on hair transplants and Invisalign smh
their kid would be named James Harden III. James is the dad and LeBron is the mom. the child would gestate in LeBron's stomach for nine months and be born from his asshole. he would be very good at basketball. if James Harden then has a child with Damian Lillard it would tear the family apart
Who loses in this trade  LeBron James for T.J. Leaf straight up
"And D-Wade was playing a team missing their 2nd best player since half the season, and had the oldest average age - while playing next to prime LeBron James and Chris Bosh.    So it seems like those ""contexts"" at best equal each other out. Hence, not even worth mentioning.   Just kinda cringe people not wanting to give the guy credit and start bringing all the excuses lol  Whatever helps you sleep at night. Keep believing AD only put up those numbers because they were missing Bam or Dragic. Good luck."
Im not saying im actually Lebron James but nobody has ever seen me and Lebron in the same room before either soooooo
"&gt; his contract is set up to also use the rule LeBron and CP3 put in place for themselves to make more money.   If you’re talking about a Supermax contract, James Harden is already on one and neither LeBron nor CP3 have ever signed one."
LeBron James posts here pretty consistently and y’all haven’t even figured it out yet 😳
Read “LeBron Games” as Lebron James
"lebron james is, in fact, gwangi"
"Jordan still pretty easily. He is considered goat by majority who havent even seen him still even among teens and 20 to 30 years old.  NBA players were polled in 2018 and 70% of them picked picked Jordan (comapred to 11% for Lebron), even though most of the players in the NBA today grew up watching Lebron.   Business Insider polled American the public (before this lakers championship of course), and the overwhelming majority picked Jordan. He beat lebron in every age range, even the youngest subset (60% of 18-29 year olds picked Jordan, compared to only 20% for Lebron).  [Source](https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bulls/ct-spt-bulls-michael-jordan-lebron-james-survey-20190322-story.html)   Public Policy Polling (a legitimate polling company) also conducted a poll last year, and you guessed it, Jordan beat lebron handily once again.   https://mobile.twitter.com/ppppolls/status/1006914864584056837   Based on this, those who havent seen jordan but seen lebron still place jordan higher."
"I guess I'm missing something here, I haven't taken finance in like 10 years now. Are you saying that if they borrow 25 million, and use that to pay the players, that they pay back less then 25 million in today's dollars due to inflation? I agree, so say in today's dollars they end up having to pay back 20 million. Cool, but they are still down an EXTRA 20 million. Why don't the players just borrow the money and pay themselves using your logic since interest rates are so low?  The owners and the players already have an agreement in place for revenue sharing, it's 50/50. Why would the owners all of the sudden dish out more money and subsidise the players, how is that fair? The owners are already losing 50% of the 1.5 Billion loss, the players are going to lose the other 50%.   On top of that, we are assuming next year is going to be 1.5 billion less, when in reality next years revenue loss can be EVEN HIGHER. Most of last seasons was completed normally. It's looking as if this season it's going to start without fans. Not to mention the lowered ratings are going to impact sponsorship money. The NBA, like many businesses is going to have to adapt, and it will be interesting to see how they do so.  EDIT: The players salaries have already been cut (obviously). And they will continue to be cut even more as the league struggles financially. https://www.insider.com/nba-salaries-reduced-lebron-james-steph-curry-2020-5"
zIon is a generational rookie  that has not been hyped up since Lebron james. He got ROY being injured the entire season 😂 if you don't find that scary idk what will.   I expect the pelicans to be 6-8 in the west. Barring health.
Lebron James*
"Not even close to the best scorer in the league. LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard can actually up their scoring and efficiency in the playoffs, which Durant only did consistently while surrounded with the core of a 73-9 team."
"LeBron James was ready to step back and let Kawhi and AD run the show. When Kawhi chose the Clippers, he largely upheld that promise for AD. In exchange, AD let LeBron age gracefully. Everyone marvels at how LeBron plays so well despite the minutes played and age, but it wouldn't be possible without AD helping him out. Kind of like how Tom Brady is aging so well for Tampa Bay because he has so many legitimately good receivers."
"For the record, LeBron is an international super star. Whose Nba jersey and shoes have been sold and wore the most? LeBron James"
"LeBron James. Thoughts? • “He’s great. He’s phenomenal. To be able to perform at that high of that level is phenomenal. Not calling him the GOAT but in the conversation. That’s a two-man race.”  • “When I am not talking shit about him, I talk about what he does for people and his people.”  • “Transcendent talent, but an overchoreographed public image and off-the-court persona. Too obviously rehearsed and planned. Not genuine. An obsession with creating a legacy instead of letting the legacy create itself.”  • “At his age and he’s still the best player in the NBA. Like or dislike him, he’s an unstoppable force on and off the court. I don’t know what kind of person he is off the court but the stuff we know he does is great.”  • “The greatest philanthropic athlete since Muhammad Ali. The second greatest player ever. To be the man you’ve got to beat the man.”  • “Terrific player but an insatiable ego. Has done some good things societally. I think that’s important. He’s put his money where his mouth is, which I like, but his mouth is everywhere. That’s the problem. … People that criticize him, it’s just incredible. I’d love to know what they’ve accomplished in their lives.”  • “I think he is the second greatest player of all time. I think he is somebody who is able to transform basketball similar to the way Michael Jordan did. I think Michael took it to a certain level. I think LeBron took it to a new level with this generation. Looking back and seeing how much pressure he had on him coming out and for his career to turn out the way it did is really impressive.”  • “I think he’s the best player of all time, but these playoffs really changed my view and took it to another level for me. If you thought he had lost a step, you realize he can pace himself and then put his foot on the gas when he wants to. It was amazing. There were times in the bubble when he’s slowing down and then you see, no, he was being strategic and not showing his hand. It was remarkable to watch. He’s just so in control on the floor and it’s magnificent to see. He’s the defining player of our era. I’m really lucky I got to see him.”  • “I think he’s an all-time phenomenon. An amazing career. I think he’s a notch below Michael Jordan still but I think it’s amazing how he’s evolved. It’s amazing what he’s done and continues to do. The bad thing, the only bad thing, everyone is afraid to say this and I’m not afraid to say it individually, but I’m just saying this because it’s true. And everybody knows this, who is in this business.  “The worst thing that LeBron is doing is forcing this power with Rich Paul and what that is, in terms of, he’s a player, but he has prowess in the media space. His company Spring Hill, that’s awesome. Doing the movies and all of the projects. That’s so commendable. I love that. But now that they’ve jumped into the agent game, which the reality is, it’s illegal for a player, particularly if you’re in the state of California, to be licensed to represent talent.  “Now I know it’s this façade that it’s Rich Paul, but it’s really LeBron who recruits for Rich Paul. So it’s almost like they’re trying to control AAU at the NBA level. This is my AAU team and they’ve carried that to the highest level. And because of his power and his prowess, people, the young players are seduced by LeBron James in the same way people were seduced by Michael Jordan with David Falk. He went from having Michael Jordan and a few other players, to getting the top players in the NBA, because of the Jordan factor. Rob Pelinka had tremendous success as an independent agent because he had Kobe Bryant and the players idolized him. So, the fact that LeBron recruits and has empowered Rich Paul, and I get it, on the top guys, but if someone does their research, a lot of these guys have really gotten screwed, a large number of them, by mismanagement.  “There’s at least five or six massive casualties. Nobody is saying anything and you can even say that the union should take some responsibility because they represent all of the players, not just LeBron James. Because this is anonymous. I hope you have the courage to put this out there, because nobody is talking about this but this is the reality, and if you ask any other agent what I just said, they would all agree. ** **“They’ve been able to leverage KCP, two or three years in a row because they have the power and they’re forcing it down their throat. Nerlens Noel. There are four or five of them that have suffered millions of dollars from mismanagement but nobody has the courage to support it, because all the media wants access to LeBron. They want access to AD.  “What he’s done is he’s taking AAU basketball to the NBA, because he has the ability to do that because these young players idolize him. I’m starting to hear some rumblings that they might be overloaded. Because you can’t have this level of expectation for a client and service all of these guys. Ben Simmons. Garland. I know this as an agent, you can’t service them all at this level. You can seduce them, but you can’t service them all, at that level with what they say they’re doing. Nerlens Noel. Norris Cole. Shabazz Muhammed. They lost $80 million in Detroit. This is real talk.  *“That’s the only disappointment is LeBron has leveraged his popularity with young players for seducing them for Klutch and it’s not serving all the players well. But for the players that are suffering, there’s no repercussions. Nobody is criticizing what they’re doing. And you have to call out the union. They should be meeting with Rich Paul, saying, ‘What happened here? What happened here? They represent all the players. They all pay the same amount for dues. If Rich Paul were a lawyer, he’d be disbarred five times. But because LeBron is so powerful, there is no accountability. And that’s the only bad part with LeBron. Everything else is great. It’s commendable. It’s progressive. I love it. The part that he’s pushed Rich Paul in this position and these naïve basketball players, that’s pretty egregiously irresponsible.” *  • “I can’t put it in one word. I think he’ll be the greatest of all time, just based on longevity and the list of accomplishments. With my era and my age, I still say MJ is the greatest, but I think it’s going to be hard to argue LeBron’s place because of all the things he accomplished and the longevity of his career. The combination of the two. And I have to say what he does politically and with social responsibility stuff, I’m really impressed with him. I’m impressed with how he’s set up Rich Paul and Maverick Carter. I think few black athletes and celebrities do that. I’m impressed with the stands that he takes and the courage.

LeBron James is so strong!
The heat were the 3 seed and then they added Lebron James and Chris Bosh and a few role players and then still lost in the finals
"Y’all get so emotional and triggered when it comes to Jordan. It’s not that deep bro, calm down.   https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/michael-jordan-green-lit-last-dance-after-lebron-james-2016-nba-title-win"
"He might be Top 5 (maybe), but there is a wide gulf between him and the actual best player in the league. He's got no offensive moves. He has great body control and form, as he always gets square with the basket on any shot. He's like a shorter Tim Duncan in that way. Obviously has great hands too. But he really has no moves. He can do a basic version of everything, but he doesn't have an elite version of anything. What's his go-to? Signature shot? He was an integral part of a great Spurs TEAM Championship where there really was no clear ""the guy"" on that team, and he lucked out with the Raptors. Hit the luckiest shot ever on the 76ers, and they wouldn't have beaten a healthy Warriors team; everyone knows that. The way he was escorted to the top of the league based on that...laughable.  I'd have to put LeBron (by a country mile), Giannis, Steph, and AD all above Kawhi. And, because he's a perennial MVP candidate and Kawhi doesn't play enough games to be in that conversation, James Harden too.  As for all the talk, Kawhi is **WHY THEY WERE TALKING**. They thought ""Hey, we got the 'best player' in the league and we were already good, now we're unstoppable"". That's what they thought. Did Kawhi do a damn thing towards reigning his guys in? He's the leader of that team, supposedly, he's supposed to set the tone. He didn't."
"This is the transition that will probably take place over the next 5 years.  Nevertheless, LeBron James is still playing at such a high level at 35 and a half that it is hard to see it decline in the next 3 years."
Who is the GOAT?  A) LeBron James B) Michael Jordan C) Che
It's 2020 and people are still sleeping on LeBron James.
How is it a lie tho?  https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/michael-jordan-green-lit-last-dance-after-lebron-james-2016-nba-title-win  Jordan fans just insecure. This is how this shit works.
"Sure. Provide your sources to back up your claim.   Here are my sources.   &gt;	The analysis made by 12up notably shows that LeBron James is the more clutch player. Not only did he make more shots in these situations, but he did so in fewer attempts.

1. Wilt Chamberlain   2a. Michael Jordan  2b. LeBron James
"Nah, Raymone Lebron James, Sr. is the best /s"
"Don't worry, you will be defending this era and LeBron James when some kids who cannot even talk yet will tell you how awful this era was and how x player on y team would obliterate your favorite players today"
Shaq and Lebron could get so many more calls but they didn't so as a James Harden fan you're just going to have to deal with it
"If Jordan played today then he would have had control over team personnel like Kawhi Leonard does with the Clippers and LeBron James had with the Lakers/Heat/Cavs.   Jordan is a horrible personnel guy. Frank Kaminsky. MKG. Adam Morrison. The list goes on and on. He would have hurt his own chances to win those six championships.   Punching out Steve Kerr because Kerr's son torched Jordan's son in basketball would have been a year long story. Pippen's displeasure over the bad contract he signed would have been non stop social media madness. Can you imagine a drunk Charles Oakley with a Twitter account after he was traded for Bill Cartwright? Or if Rodney McCray had a social media forum to talk about the abuse he took because Krause would not trade for/sign Walter Davis instead?   Also the issue over Nike and using child/slave labor would have blown up as the Air Jordan brand exploded.   Let's not pretend here. Given a social media age and the risk of a gambling scandal that would destroy the game, what do you guys think David Stern would do? A tragic end to Michael Jordan would be something the league could build it's brand around. A live Jordan with a gambling scandal would hurt the league forever."

AD attended the LeBron James Basketball Academy as a teenager lol
"The spo thing was literally just one question that lebron asked pat during his first year. That and bumping spo once which caused the media to nut itself looking for commentary.  The blatt thing. I've always wanted to voice my thoughts about this because i hate that the media makes it entirely an off-court issue when there are legitimate X's and O's problems that are worth discussing. yeah lebron definitely had a hand in blatt's firing, but tbh Blatt deserved to be fired regardless of what Lebron felt just by his mistakes. Not even considering the way he almost blew game 4 vs chicago, blatt did plenty wrong on his own to deserve to be fired despite his record and pedigree. This includes:  1. He did not know how to utilize Kevin Love in the offense (Lue fixed this and rly doesn't get enough credit for doing so). Love's efficiency and touches were so much better under lue. Its not like you can just blame lebron for love's struggles by saying ""Bosh role"" - Blatt failed him too. Oh yeah, and Blatt also called love ""not a max player"". Not the smartest thing to say. 2. Love isn't alone, this was a trend of bad rotations and mismanaged veteran talent constantly. like, he put shawn marion as a shooting guard, failed, and then stopped playing him even though he'd have been great as a stretch 4. 3. this seems small, but it might have cost the cavs the 2015 finals, since a scheme with marion incorporated fully as a stretch 4 might have been a good counter to the death lineup. But no, he continued to play james jones instead. i'm not saying they win with marion but its more likely than those awful minutes james jones was giving in the playoffs. beyond that, his adjustments in general were unimpressive (though the 2015 cavs didnt have a lot of lineup flexibility, Lue showed a much better feel for this overall). 4. he was known for being bad at drawing ATO plays and would waste precious seconds figuring out what to do. Again, another thing Lue was much better at. 5. the results of the 30-11 are misleading. advanced stats indicated a team that would not win the title as things were (despite the worse record under lue the cavs SRS was better overall). Griffin knew this. Everyone knew this. They had to make changes. Personnel wise, they brought in Frye to make their small-ball shooting better and benched the declining Mosgov. But coaching also needed a shake-up.  did lebron's lack of respect for blatt have anything to do with his firing? absolutely. but its not rly a fair comparison to make, since lebron was happy with vogel from day 1 but didn't ever want blatt there. additionally, the media, because its the media, will only tell you the drama side, not the many xs and os failings of blatt. It was a fair firing based on basketball reasons as much as it was a firing based on lebron's unhappiness. The pressure to win certainly motivated griffin to act faster than a lot of teams would have. But blatt wasn't an nba-championship caliber coach.  Edit: I should clarify that I don’t necessarily think blast was a horrible coach. He did a lot of things well too. The defensive scheme with Mosgov worked very well and a lot of his Kyrie / Lebron actions were effective. But he wasn’t going to get the cavs to a title. The mistakes he made made that clear"
Lebron James  Carmelo Anthony  Dame Lillard  Brandon Roy  Derrick Rose  David Lee  Ray Allen  Kobe Bryant  Jr Smith  Steph Curry
Who did not win five or more NBA championships?  A. Kobe Bryant   B. Lebron James   C. Tim Duncan   D. Don Nelson
1. Russell Westbrook 2. KD 3. Steven Adams  4. Bill Russell  5. Lebron James  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. Shaq 8. Dirk 9. CP3 10. Harden
"Who joins Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, LeBron James, and Michael Jordan as the only players in NBA history to play 800 games while averaging atleast 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 1.4 steals on 49% field goal percentage and 30% three point percentage?  A - Tim Duncan  B - Kobe Bryant  C - Thaddeus Young  D - Kevin Durant"
"The MVP candidates are probably:  Giannis Antekoumpo, Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons (if he learns to shoot threes), Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, Donovan Mitchell, Luka Doncic, and Stephen Curry.   These realistically are the set of players that have the talent to have an MVP Caliber season (or at least Top 5 in voting) and who are on teams that have a chance to finish at the top of their conference.  Luka's success will largely come down to the Maverick's team success. If they're a low seed, he won't have a chance, but if they're the 1-seed somehow he could get it.  It's too hard to predict, but it usually comes from a guy on the best team, and in both the East/West it's impossible to tell where the top teams will stack up.   Giannis being a 2-time in a row winner definitely helps, but if the Bucks smash everyone in the regular season again and he's far away statistically from everyone else he will probably just win it again."
"MVP - Stephen Curry - Warriors get the best record in the league and Curry averages MVP like stats. Lebron finishes 2nd, but takes it too easy. Giannis still finishes 3rd, and has the best stats, and Luka finishes 4th, and then Jayson Tatum finishes 5th. James Harden fans argue he actually has the best stats, but the Rockets winning the 72-game equivalent of less than 50 games leaves Harden without a Top 5 MVP finish, causing him to ask out of Houston at the end of the season.  Finals MVP: Stephen Curry - The Warriors rebound and win the last championship of their dynasty.  DPOY - Anthony Davis - This will be awarded to him for his defense on Jimmy Butler in the finals, despite Giannis and Gobert having a good case for being more deserving."
Which player hasn't repeated as MVP?   a) Michael Jordan  b) Kobe Bryant  c) LeBron James  d) Steve Nash
"I started watching ball in the 2012-13 season and while the 12-13 Raptors weren't the best, the 4 Raptors on my list is what made me love basketball overtime. I remember I also fell in love with Steph Curry when I watched the Warriors vs Nuggets series in 2013 playoffs, what a great series that was.    1. DeRozan  2. Lowry  3. LeBron James  4. Steph Curry  5. Jonas Valanciunas  6. Kevin Durant  7. Dirk Nowitzki  8. Klay Thompson  9. Duncan  10. Amir Johnson"
"In 10 years, the Lakers will have Lebron James, Dwight Howard, and Rajon Rondo.   Also, the Cavs at one point will have Dwyane Wade, Lebron, Kevin Love, and Derrick Rose.   Funny how this league works."
"LeBron James will be #1 in three years when his career tops 389 million.  Chris Paul #2 at 343.  Harden, even with his monster contract, will only reach 315 four years from now, leaving him in the top-5 behind KG (current #1) and Kobe.  I did no research other than looking up LeBron, Paul, and Harden.  If there are any other albatross contracts out there lemme know.  edit: Westbrook will hit 335, passing KG for #3 all-time!"
Reality: I told Anthony Davis that the Lakers are LeBron James' team
I just woke up from a coma. I’ve read every post in this thread. I want to congratulate LeBron James for his obvious consensus 2020 regular season MVP winner.
"MVP: Luka Doncic. Dallas was one of the five best teams in the league by net rating. They had the point differential of a mid-50 win team (over a full season, of course) but blew a lot of close games. I wouldn't be surprised if they finish on pace for closer to 60 wins than 50 wins.   Finals MVP: I legitimately have no idea, but I'd guess LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard.   DPOY: Anthony Davis. He was arguably the best defensive player in the league this season. I doubt Giannis Antetokounmpo wins it again after these recent playoff disappointments so its' Davis' for the taking."
"The whole idea of a big free agency year is to land a generational fish, that still fits within what you are trying to do (Lebron James being perhaps an exception since he can be placed in any situation imaginable and make you a contender). I""m not sure Giannis is like that, but if Riley thinks he can fit the system and culture of course they should go for it. But for a team like Miami, which as constructed right now can compete for getting out of their conference (but not a shoe in by any means!), the only way to guarantee being a shoe-in in your conference and tilting the odds in your favor in the finals is to have that generational player (or two). You can have an amazing team but every now and then you need the one great player to carry your load. Butler did incredible in this, but is just a notch short of the generational impact. I'm saying all this because I feel if Miami cannot get something like that in the off-season, they should NOT settle for an Oladipo, or a Bradley Beal, or a similar level Star level but not generational player. The Heat are already good enough that such a player will actually not add that much to you, because basically, you are dividing a limited resource (playing time), among a zero sum group of players. When you have quite a few really good players, and a near superstar, or Superstar 1a, you need the generational player. That will make impact. Anything less, I don't think it makes you more likely to win a championship. Just more likely to whether injury and fatigue."
"Lebron James: "" If you want to get the most out of this year then we can help you do that."""
"Did you not watch that series? Warriors were constantly guarding Harden with their arms cocked backwards. It was a big story at the time. Hell, LeBron did the [same thing](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/12/lebron-james-lakers-rockets-no-hands-defense-james-harden-video). One of the best defensive teams in the Jazz stopped having their defender in front of him at all to attempt to do the same thing.  Refs call regular season and the playoffs differently, and they call important playoff games even more different than that. Harden falls apart late in important games because the refs stop calling what he normally baits. You can argue that's unfair, but I'd argue it's unfair they call it the other 46 minutes of the game.   To quote one of the best summaries of Harden's game,  &gt; [No](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bbhk13/dennis_schr%C3%B6der_fouls_james_harden_in_a_tight_game/) I'm saying that this is just [one](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/aqfb7b/harden_throws_himself_into_defender_to_try_and/) example of [Countless](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/aozzj8/harden_chases_the_ref_for_a_foul_call_rather_than/) times Harden pulls some [dumb](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/amlmm2/james_harden_falls_over_for_no_reason/) shit in the closing [minutes](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/agtjwo/james_harden_blatantly_flops_into_next_week/) of Games.

"Lebron ""LeGoat"" James would never - Shannon probably"
i don’t understand people saying luka isn’t a 10/10 playmaker... have any of you actually watched this dude play basketball? nobody with exception of lebron james can pass like he can under the pressure he gets put under
"Lol I love lebron James, but when it comes to politics he is the biggest clown in America."
"Interesting.   I wouldn't put those in the same category as Air Jordan is one of the biggest brands in the world, where King James is a solid nickname for LeBron. But most people call him LeBron.  I guess the way I look at it is that MJ built his brand around the ""Air Jordan"" name where LeBron went more for LBJ/LeBron."
LeBron James threw the 2011 Finals
"Based on how they looked when they were last fully healthy  1. Kevin Durant - was absolutely unstoppable until he got injured and was straight dad dicking the league   2. Steph Curry - was absolutely carrying the injured Warriors in the finals and was the best player in the series   3. LeBron James - great playoff run from LeBron but not quite as great as what we saw in 2018 or 2016.   4. Luka Doncic - a walking 30 point triple double and his 40 point triple double with the buzzer beater will be looked at in 20 years as his 'Jordan 63 points vs the Celtics' moment   5. James Harden - was having one of his best playoff runs however the rest of his team didnt show up.   6. Nikola Jokic - cemented himself as the best big man in the game to me. Lead his team to 2 3-1 lead comebacks and to the WCF as the number 1 option. Something that AD was never able to do and something Giannis was unable to do this playoffs.   7. Kawhi Leonard - great playoff run from Kawhi until that game 7.   8. Jimmy Butler - all time great finals performance in a loss from Jimmy G Buckets. Absolutely carried the Heat when Bam and Dragic were down and scored more clutch buckets than anyone since Kawhi and Dirk in 2019 and 2011.   9. Anthony Davis - had a great playoff run but benefitted from playing behind LeBron and we saw that Jimmy was clearly the 2nd best player in the finals.   10. Giannis Antetokounmpo - this may seem low but based on when we last saw him, he had the worst performance of anyone on this list.  11. Damian Lillard  12. Joel Embiid  13. Jayson Tatum  14. Chris Paul  15. Klay Thompson"
"If Kuzma cannot play well alongside Anthony Davis and  LeBron freakin James, then perhaps he's played all of his cards?"
LeBron James &gt; Kawhi Leonard &gt; Steph Curry &gt; Kevin Durant &gt;  James Harden &gt; the rest
LeBron James
I find it hilarious how this entire show revolves around LeBron James. These topics they come up with every day are incredible lol. We will see if they can keep this up for two more months
Who the fuck are his teammates tho? Not LeBron James.
"Yeah its crazy that after one post season playing next to LeBron fucking James, people are putting AD above the B2B MVP. Fucking ludicrous."
"Anthony Davis is in the best situation he could possibly be with Lebron James and Rondo facilitating for him you act like his years with the Pelicans don’t exist, Harden has choked multiple times they benched him in 2015 against the Clippers and the Rockets bench won them that game, 2017 choked against the Spurs, 2018 wasn’t his fault, 2018 KD was injured and they still couldn’t beat that Warriors team, Kawhi just gave up a 3-1 lead and his Raptors team went 7 games in the ECSF so it’s not like he carried them by any means, KD had to join a 73-9 team before he started winning championships so I don’t see how any of these players are clearly better put Giannis on the Lakers they win multiple chips regardless of fit, put him on the Warriors they win multiple chips, put him on the Raptors they win or at least make the Finals, which one of those players are even carrying the Bucks to the best record in the league ? And he lost to a heat team that took the Lakers to 6 games in the Finals you act like every other player is perfect"
I am LeBron James
There are many sports moments and videos that encapsulates why sports are so special in many different ways.  This one right here is one of the perfect ones.  A deaf basketball fan from Lebanon was moved to tears at 6:00 AM in the morning watching LeBron James win an NBA Championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers.  And you can visibly see and hear the joy and emotion that moment brought him.  Damn that is awesome.
They should trade him for LeBron James 😳
"They kinda have to care about money right now though. If they have another finals where 5 million people watch lebron fuckin james on the lakers, advertisers are just gonna dip and spend more on football, and the salary cap is gonna drop to like 90, and we're gonna end up with lebron, AD, and 3 redditors making $15 an hour. In a microcosm of the economy as a whole, the middle class multimillionare NBA player will be forced out. Cry for them."
LeBron James
"&gt;Any piece with the premise ""Does this player have the same defensive impact as the guy who had the most defensive impact in the history of the NBA and won like 37472 rings based almost solely on his defensive impact"" is going to be rightly mocked on premise along.    This is a very good point and I'm sure it's one that many others share as well. When you're comparing any modern, relatively-young superstars to all-time-greats, fans get understandably shifty.   I think *(I'm not sure if I'm going to communicate this tactfully enough, but I'll try; please forgive me if I fail to do so)* where some fans/analysts *(e.g. Ben Taylor or Mike Prada)* differ is their ability to separate outstanding individual regular-season/postseason runs by still ""unproven"" younger superstars from their historical-contexts and appreciate their value fully, because of their vast historical knowledge and film-study, etc.:  For example, Giannis just had a GOAT-level regular-season *(impact-metric-wise, as well as likely team-wins-wise had the season panned out without interruption)* earlier this year, which would rightfully be viewed as underrated in the future IF he were to achieve his immense potential and win multiple rings, by legions of fans looking back adoringly on his Basketball Reference page in 10 years' time, but will currently likely summon an eye-roll and a *""Talk to me when he shows up in the playoffs""* from the vast-majority of current fans..  [Jordan](https://backpicks.com/2018/04/08/backpicks-goat-2-michael-jordan/) and [LeBron](https://backpicks.com/2018/04/05/backpicks-goat-3-lebron-james/) both likely had similar (though differing) skeptics along similar lines; there is a VERY good argument that [Jordan's 89-91 3-year run is his statistical-peak ahead of his 5 later 3-peat seasons](https://backpicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Michael-Jordan-seasonal-valuations.png) *(with a strong argument for 88 as well)*, and LeBron's [09-10 regular-/post-seasons stack up very well statistically compared to his Miami tenure](https://backpicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/LeBron-GOAT-seasonal-valuations.png), but because most of these seasons happened before MJ/LeBron had won rings, they likely weren't given the plaudits they deserved for their obscenely-good overall play during those seasons despite not winning a championship in the end --- Jordan being derided as a *""chucker""* or *""non-winning player""* and LeBron being completely dismissed as a *""choker""/ ""he's good but he's no Kobe""/ ""LeFraud"" / ""no killer instinct""* etc. .   This is DESPITE their impact metrics in these seasons *(both regular-season and postseason)* often COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY DWARFING the rest of the NBA *(and pretty much the rest of NBA history, plus even a few of their OWN later ring-winning regular-/post-seasons)*, but since those few particular all-time-great seasons didn't end up in rings, they've pretty much been lost to time, with only the occasional analyst/fan/Basketball Reference enthusiast who brings them up from time to time  ---  ...  All of this is a long-winded way of saying... I personally think it's fine to appreciate younger players' greatness in the current era even if they have yet to win multiple-ring(s) / become a 10-time-all-star. A player can be transcendental and still not win a ring; **AD can be 26 years old with a single ring and no Finals MVPs and STILL have a postseason-run that's at least** ***a PASABLE FASCIMILE*** **of the greatest defender and winner in NBA history**.  Mind you, I don't think Mike Prada is necessarily saying that AD's as good/impactful at defense as Russell was (nor do I personally think that). He's saying that Davis, ONLY IN THIS POSTSEASON RUN, was so freaking good, and all-encompassing, and insanely essential to the Lakers' eventual success, that Bill Russell comparisons would not be completely laughed out of the room by anyone familiar with both players' defensive playstyle and overall impact on the game..  To quote another comment I made in this thread:  &gt;Haha, Russell is obviously in a [completely different historical stratosphere](https://backpicks.com/2018/04/02/backpicks-goat-3-bill-russell/), I don't think that's an argument at the moment  &gt;I think what Mike Prada's saying is that AD's impact on the court these past playoffs was *reminiscent* of Russell - the way he would harass guards on the perimeter, shut down drives, contest jumpshots, *and* bother elite bigs (sometimes all the in the same play!). It would clearly be extremely difficult to replicate the insane impact Russell had in *any* era *(see my other comment on Russell being a complete and utter defensive [historical-outlier](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/jgg9q8/is_anthony_daviss_defensive_impact_similar_to/g9qbw8y/))*, but Davis these past playoffs has done as admirable an imitation as anyone we've seen in recent NBA history  ---  (EDIT: sorry for the rant; your comment was great and inspired another word-vomit from me LOL. i may have repeated myself a few times in there, but i hope it was at least vaguely coherent.)"
Was he not hobbling like last year? That's what I seem to recall. And what the fuck does Lebron James have to do with anything?
"I think it’s more so that’s he’s mad that whatever agent ends up getting the most popular/best player, also ends up getting a lot of the other players.  Which I mean I don’t really know how you fix. People follow their successful role-models. And it’s not like he, or anyone knows how much is a Rich Paul and how much is Lebron James.   This will ultimately happen for whatever agent is Zion, Luka, Giannis, or whoever becomes the next face of the NBA."
"LeBron James is my favourite basketball player of all time, but when he was originally in Cleveland for those first 7 years in a similar situation to Giannis playing with decent role players but without another superstar he didn't win anything either! Granted This Bucks team is better than those Cavs teams, but those Cavs teams did help LeBron get the number 1 seed 2 years in a row exactly like Giannis has these last 2 years and neither of them made the Finals in those 4 attempts. If Giannis leaves for a better situation and wins, I don't want to see you moaning about how terrible it is and that he should have stayed with the Bucks."
"Javale McGee yelled, “There you go!” Anthony Davis gave a look of pleasant surprise. Markieff Morris belted, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-Laker star Lavar Ball hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
why would i want 99c smfs when ican just be a lakers fan and have lebron james?
"""Basketball is not a priority for him"" - People in 2018 about 2020 finals MVP LeBron James"
"&gt; Theoretically, if he's trash, then compared to the teams you mentioned that we played like Denver and Miami (specifically Miami - at least to a point in that series we kicked their ass when bench players were in but were -5 starting lineup vs starting lineup, hollinger wrote about it - I dont remember whether we were with Denver) we should be losing the minutes when bench units were playing.  You have to realize though that your bench units were always buoyed by either LeBron or AD - and usually LeBron. LeBron could play with 4 random redditors in the Finals and that lineup would probably still come out dead even.  Hollinger mentions this in the article you're referring to:  &gt; The Lakers have repeatedly targeted those players when James has the ball on offense, but it’s harder for Miami to return the favor with so few exploitable mismatch possibilities. And it’s not as if Miami’s second unit has been atrocious in these playoffs, or even in the Finals. But the Heat don’t have Anthony Davis and LeBron James on their team. I want to make sure I don’t overdo it here, so let’s be clear: Davis and James are the reason this whole thing works.   Hollinger's article mostly talks about how the Lakers bench stays afloat because there's no one that opposing stars can isolate on. While I agree with this, it's also true that the Lakers didn't play any teams that had a great isolation player to attack singular pieces on the court outside of Portland in Dame and CJ. (Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the Lakers had an 'easy' route to the finals at all).  Again, Hollinger points this out when he says:  &gt; But the Heat don’t have Anthony Davis and LeBron James on their team.  The Lakers played excellent defense throughout the playoffs, and part of that was that they didn't have any one player who was easy to isolate on and pick apart. I was impressed with Kuzma's 1 on 1 defense this playoffs.  Despite this, if you check lineup data, the Lakers worst lineup by far throughout the playoffs was Rondo-KCP-Caruso-Kuzma-AD. We know that Rondo and KCP were balling out, we know Caruso is solid, and AD is a top 5 player... so why was this lineup outscored by 7.2 points per 100 possessions? Every other lineup with Kuzma (&gt;30m in the playoffs) was alongside either LeBron or LeBron + AD, so were positive.  Even in just the finals, looking at lineup data, all of the Lakers worst lineups by far involved Kuzma without LeBron.  &gt; Unless you're arguing that the rest of the lakers bench players were massive positives for their roles, this casts serious doubt on the idea that Kuz is trash; at some point, if you're playing a large ebough role on a team that's still dominant, you really can't be.  I still really disagree with that last sentiment. You can be a really bad player and still be part of very good lineups/teams.  &gt; As opposed to Norman Powell, I think this makes up for a lot of the gap in efficiency  Just to be clear, Norman Powell is an above average defender.  &gt; Not to mention the price tag - at less than 2 mil, Kuzma provides excellent value and I'm sure every team in the nba would like him on that deal.  You can't really go wrong with anyone at that price, but I genuinely think the Lakers could replace his production with a few random free agent signings (unless he improves).  &gt; ... do I sound like a hack rn?   Nah bro this is a good discussion I appreciate you"
Follow your dreams = Follow LeBron James lmao
"I thought the argument would be -  ""Players's are represented by an agency who's primary focus is making Lebron James the GOAT and supporting him. So personal interests can be sacrificed for Lebron's interests.""  I also think there is a valid argument that some of the contracts are very Lebron reliant and it will be interesting to see how the agency is after his retirement.  The incompetence argument is definitely cherry picking (unless Nerlens agent was pushing for him to sign the deal and Klutch said no and told him there would be something better if they sign with him). Pure speculation. Agent servicing may be a problem, I have no idea.  Also most/almost all agents get their foot in the door because of some connections."
"Ask me Anything about my dad LeBron James, Akron, my best friend Jaden Smith, etc. thanks"
"Anyone talking shit about Lebron James can eat a big fat dick. The guy is a fucking monster. What he has done on the court against today's athletes, who are just so much more built for basketball, is unreal."
"What the fuck? This is a joke, right? Or am I missing a hidden LeBron James in this draft"
"I’m the son of LeBron James, hello everyone. This video is real"
"It's not a matter of rings. When Jordan was playing the whole world was a bangwangon fan especially during the second run. Probably the people that lived in the US had their own teams to cheer for but for the rest of the world, NBA was about Jordan, Chicago Bulls and their story. The rest of the players and teams were just the obstacles in the way. It was like watching a James Bond movie where the rest of the players were the villains. James Bond always wins in the end.   Lebron's story is not the same. By the way  I believe that Lebron is a better player. But that is not the point."
"So you think public perception improved in jordans favour due to the doc? It was already heavily in his favour  NBA players were polled in 2018 and 70% of them picked picked Jordan (comapred to 11% for Lebron), even though most of the players in the NBA today grew up watching Lebron.   Business Insider polled American the public (before this lakers championship of course), and the overwhelming majority picked Jordan. He beat lebron in every age range, even the youngest subset (60% of 18-29 year olds picked Jordan, compared to only 20% for Lebron).  [Source](https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bulls/ct-spt-bulls-michael-jordan-lebron-james-survey-20190322-story.html)   Public Policy Polling (a legitimate polling company) also conducted a poll last year, and you guessed it, Jordan beat lebron handily once again.   https://mobile.twitter.com/ppppolls/status/1006914864584056837"
""" In an interview in the 2016 Finals, Klay Thompson said 'LeBron'. This expresses his clear wish to join James in Los Angeles in the 2020-2021 season."""
These anonymous agents just watched LeBron James dominate the playoffs and are saying KD is the best player in the league. These guys are a bunch of morons.
"Zombie Kim Jong Un agrees to tear apart his nuclear weapons, if he can play starting pg for the Lakers in a full season. We agree. It becomes evident that guarding Kim too close in games leads to off the court “injuries.” Players are afraid to guard him. So MVP KIm Jung Un goes up for the game 7 clinching bucket. Out of no where Enis Kanter clotheslines Kim! Down one at the line, Kim misses both. Celtics win the series! Bill Simmons evaporates into a green mist, a tornado comes and takes him to the wicked pissa in the sky. Mark Wahlberg goes back to being a racist rapper. All adjectives in the national anthem are changed to wicked. Lebron “ Kim’s Scottie”  James retires in shame. Kanter is never seen again."
LeBron James
"Kyrie Irving is at his absolute best with Lebron James because the combination of the gravity that Lebron creates and the unlimited freedom for him to explore his repertoire allowed full use of his natural offensive strengths.  In Cleveland, they did not care one bit if Kyrie would shoot 10 or 50 field goals attempts, they were genuinely happy for him to do whatever he wanted, no resentment whatsoever inside the court. These are just some of the things Kyrie realized he missed when he left Lebron.  In other teams, the situation is not the same anymore. We'll see next season if Durant can emulate the overall gravity of Lebron on court which could free Kyrie to return to his Cleveland form."
"Kawhi won a FMVP for doing not much better. They both shoudl have their FMVP awards renamed to the ""I survived guarding Lebron James in a Finals"" award."
"I don’t think PG is a top 20 player.   Teams with two top 10 players don’t blow 3-1 leads.   See: James, LeBron; Davis, Anthony.   Thanks for playing."
Iggy. He was FMVP and he had to guard the 3rd best GOAT Lebron James.
1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Steph Curry 4. Kevin Durant  5. James Harden  6. Anthony Davis 7. Kawhi Leonard  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Luka Doncic  10. Damian Lillard
"Yeah, because being doubted gas always lit a fire under Kyrie before. He's no LeBron James, Kyrie folds or runs when he thinks people are being mean."
"yes because you know him personally and you played with him in a team to know how is he as a teammate. gtfo with this nonsense. i bet there are dozens of guys who found it hard to have him as a teammate because how drama queen he can be and with all the passive-agressive shit he brings to all those around him.  also if you think that james was always a class act youre either 12 years old or just a dillusional stan.   btw, im done talking about him here on r/lebron. bet there will be at least 10 of you out of the woodwork to defend your king."
Lebron James haters
I mean it really depends on what aspect of Charlotte we’re talking about here. Charlotte’s horrendous drafting choices have surely cost the city’s economy tens of millions in growth.  Citation: Lebron James and the city of Cleveland
&gt; all it is is LeBron James and the Democrats buying votes and cheating the system  How is it cheating the system?
Was a law that was set up by both Democrats and Republicans probably before you were even born lol Fact that people blame this on Republicans is insane and really all it is is LeBron James and the Democrats buying votes and cheating the system that was already in place
well Bron had been saying his mission this election was to focus on getting people to the booths and not endorsing any one candidate (he endorsed hillary in 2016). But I think the Trump rally yesterday where the crowd chanted “LeBron James Sucks!” over and over again probably pushed him over the edge
"Y’all take the post at face value but my numbers sound made up. Aight   https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bloomberg-pay-florida-felons-vote/  This says $16 million. Another one I found a while back said he added $5 mil to that 16 but the numbers are different every so 15-25 is the best estimate. And my percentages are completely made up but i even prefaced it with “I’d wager” meaning I don’t have the exact numbers nor do I know them but that would be MY estimate. Now, I’ve done some better digging and found back in June that CNN reported James’s organization, More than a vote, donated $100,000 to help relief, which is a very good donation but is definitely less than 5% of 27 million, IF these are the numbers OP is talking about. So, yea my numbers are *completely* made up.  ETA: [CNN article ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/07/25/politics/lebron-james-florida-voting-rights-felons/index.html)"
He’s def pulling numbers/percentages out of his ass but Bloomberg has been pouring money in like crazy. Idk what the split is and it doesn’t really matter anyway - but rest assured Bloomberg is the one leading the charge. As he should be! He’s worth like 120x what LeBron is. Which is fucking insane to think about.   120x what ***LeBron James*** is worth. Jfc.
"This is the most backwards ass, half-ass endorsement. And to think he lost all those fans for this. They literally chanted Lebron James sucks at a Trump rally yesterday. Why? Because he lives in a $100m home in Beverly Hills but he can’t help himself from talking shit about America. He, and NBA, need a wholesale brand and image change or the NBA will be a niche sport."
Fuck lebron James.
"Seeing things like this makes “Jordan is GOAT 6-0, neva lost in the finals.” statements look even more childish. LeBron James is a complete human being.   Also lots of credit to Bloomberg, I thought he was a rich goon who thought he could Trump his way on the Democratic side. I was wrong."
Lebron James; hypocrite and coward. #notmyGOAT
"You are lying and your grammar is horrible. Lebron James was literally measured at 6'8.5"" without shoes this year since the NBA initiated its truth in height rule. And yes this video is taken from a low angle, but you were missing the point when you were busy trying to dispute the fact that Zion has the best vertical leap we've ever seen in the NBA during your episode of elitist self-indulgence. The point was his head is at the rim and he is obviously taking it easy on this jump. You obviously never watched any games when he was on Duke because his eyes were at the rim every single game. The point of my comment was that Zion obviously has the most impressive vertical for his size, and clearly has a higher DUNKING vertical than lebron james by 2-3+ inches. Not talking about jumping up for a rogue alley-oop."
"Maybe I'm crazy but, as a supporter of both causes, I felt like Lebron has only really hit wide open layups on social issues. He's never the first to take a stand and does so only when it suits him. So I don't really consider him the champion of social issues some make him out to be.  I think it said a lot that Lebron didn't even use the jersey slogan opportunity to say anything. Tyler Herro was out the with BLM yet Lebron's jersey only said ""James"". And at the end of the day, I really think that's all he stands for. He's a savvy businessman.. no different than a generic Nike social justice commercial with little substance.   I think there are many athletes (and of course even more non-athletes) who are much better examples of social concientiousness, LBJ's just really famous. He's not Muhammad Ali or Bill Russell tho imo not even close.   His most ""unique"" social stance was calling an MIT grad ""uneducated"" when that MIT grad was criticizing a totalitarian regime. That's clown work in my book."
"I mean if we're being realistic about it, it'd make a shit ton of money, undeniably. he never would because LeBron James is a guy who wants to be looked upon positively at all times. lol having said that, if anyone here thinks Bron wouldn't be at minimum far and away the highest earner on the app, they're wrong. lol he's too famous not to be.  and to answer your real question, I don't think it makes anything for the league unless they get a little percentage and a bunch more athletes jump in there. everyone from Harden hanging out with the hottest dudes, to Zach Randolph grittin and grinding, you gotta get em all involved."
"👨🏻‍🦳🧑🏻‍🦳🧓🏻👴🏻👱🏻👨🏻‍🦰: ""LeBron James sucks!""  lmao give me a fuckin break"
Who is Lebron James? And who cares what he thinks?  Think for yourself!
"Hard to imagine when the Trump rally is chanting ""LeBron James Sucks"" last night."
"Yes.  We are.  He just won a championship on the most popular NBA team.  He is a top-two player of all time and arguably the GOAT.  He has endorsements.  He has a TV show.  He is the face of the NBA, which no other sports franchise has.  They have stars, but LeBron James is undoubtedly the most recognizable person in American sports.    He has the most Instagram followers out of anybody in American sports, by far.  I don't think it's debatable.  It could have been Kobe or Tiger a while back but LeBron has had it for a while."
"Of all the things to provide funds for, Lebron James chooses felons in a scheme very close to money for votes, which is highly illegal.  This is why Lebron James is so thoroughly hated.  &amp;#x200B;  Starving people in his home town of Cleveland?  Fuck them.  Homeless in his new town of LA?  Fuck Them.  Felons?  Oh yeah, I got time for that shit.  &amp;#x200B;  This dude is an idiot."
Honest question:  what do you think the highest level of math has LeBron James studied?  Pre-Algebra?

*Lebron James endorses not Trump for president   FTFY
TIL that Lebron James must stand to profit somehow should Biden win.
"The right analogy would be if MJ blasted Phil Jackson or somebody for them saying “free Taiwan”.  People wouldn’t have given LBJ too hard a time if he just remained silent about HK. It’s blasting Morey for him speaking his mind that is the problem.   And that’s a terrible take on LBJ not profiting off China. Just 2 years ago Nike made $6.2 billion from China out of their $34.5 billion global revenue. (Source below). LBJ has maintained he wants to be a billionaire and own a team. He absolutely put Morey down to protect LBJ’s financial interest. I agree with the folks saying that’s a stupid criteria on who’s the GOAT, but what LBJ did was messed up.   https://www.foxbusiness.com/sports/lebron-james-has-plenty-of-ties-to-china-with-his-endorsement-deals"
Lebron is a Chinese pawn.  https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2019/10/17/lebron-james-nike-china-revenue/3989915002/
The Communist Party of China (CCP) controls its proxy media corporation Tencent.  Tencent is a major distributor of NBA streaming.  When NBA people showed support for the pro-Democracy movement in Hong Kong the Communist Party pulled the plug on the NBA. When professional gamers talked about it the CCP pulled the plug on them as well.  There were people in the NBA who bent their knee to the Communist Party and chose to support the side that brutally suppresses human rights. Just so they could continue being famous and wealthy.   The Communist Party of China is suppressing human rights in Hong Kong and when Americans talked about it the CCP used its state controlled media corporation to silence Americans. To intimidate Americans.  Guess what role Lebron James played in all of this.
"To be fair, LeBron James is one of the dumbest people on television."
Lebron james is the facto the most popular american athlete in the world. One season of bad rating didn't compare to succesful 16 season before it.
wow reddits thoughts on lebron james went from chinese shill to political intellectual really fast
Oh I think he was the best player in the east not named LeBron James in 2017. He was balling and we had an insane 18 home game win streak after a 2-8 start. He was arguably a top 10 player that season and only behind Curry Westbrook and maybe CP3 when it came to point guards.
Cool. Is he still defending a man who serially sexually assaulted his ex? Yes?  I don’t give a FUCK who LeBron James endorses. Dude’s political fucking moron sellout.
"I have a pretty interesting story;  Back in 2005, my little sisters best friend was suffering from Leukemia. He loved sports so much, &amp; he got to do a few cool things through Make-A-Wish, like [tour the Tampa Bay Bucs facility w/ Ronde Barber, who was his favorite NFL player, in 2006.](https://www.buccaneers.com/news/a-dream-fulfilled-2146255) My mom got in contact w/ the Lebron James Foundation, &amp; for months, emailed someone from high up in the organization about doing a meet &amp; greet w/ Lebron James, cause he absolutely adored Lebron. To my knowledge, &amp; from what I remember, Lebron didn't do these types of things on days of games. Well, he made the acception for my friend, &amp; we went to meet him before the game on the court when they played the Lakers. He was super cool, &amp; my sister &amp; him sat w/ his mom, Gloria, while my mom &amp; I sat in the press box. It was a wonderful experience, &amp; he was just over the moon. Unfortunately, I don't think there's a story about it, cause it was decided to be kept out of tye publics knowledge about what LeBron did, but I think my mom or sister has a photo of us w/ him. If I find it, I'll update w/ the picture."
"I feel like I've explained that at least twice now. But once more for the people in the back:        Any time Lebron James does something good for society or social justice, people comment about what he said about Morey/China. My comment was just pointing that out. It was not taking a shot at Lebron (I generally hold a high opinion of him) or China (which, if we're being honest here, has done some fucked up things in terms of social equality), it's just a meme that someone would bring it up.           Anyways, I know this isn't a real apology and I'm using it on purpose, but sorry you were offended by my comment."
"I said it has nothing to do with slighting James, which I guess is not true, but the intention was not to knock Lebron. It's just literally mentioned anytime says something positive about his humanitarian work. .. it's just the inb4 meme dude, no reason to get so triggered and start defending China."
We think of Lebron James as someone rich beyond imagination. But 500 million is almost twice as much as Lebron has made in salary over his entire career!  For one (failed) campaign. Crazy.
"Are you an idiot? LeBron James is a basketball player, so I believe his opinion would be considered basketball related?"

Fuck lebron James. Hey lebron suck a dick. I voted for Trump you bitch.
Adam silver and the NBA will be financing a 1 hour television special in which Luka Doncic and Skip Bayless take turns comparing Lebron James to players such as Derek Fisher and Robert Horry
"Curry all time ranking as a player on his total career isn’t as high as you’d think then. He’s legit only had 4-5 years of being a top end player, he was drafted in 09 and didn’t even become a certified star until he was in his 2013 season. You are thinking of his peak, which yes his peak is among prob the top 10 greatest seasons   He had ankle injuries and he didn’t have winning teams.   Chris Paul on the other hand has been a top 3 PG in the league for a majority of his career, was a perennial MVP candidate throughout most of his career until the 2015 season, has almost double the all NBA and All Star appearances, and ON TOP of that is a 9x all NBA Defensive teams, and his advanced stats metrics actually are above the likes of Lebron and MJ in some areas.   James Harden has been a scoring god basically. He’s arguably been the best offensive player in the league for the past 3 seasons at the very least, he has more all nba appearances and all star appearances, and his playoff numbers is among some of the greatest.   Like I said, All Time Rankings are a career evaluation not just a peak rating."
If anybody changes either mind because of Lebron James should they really be voting?

"LeBron ""Top Five"" James, because he's probably one of the top five players off all time."
"There is nothing special about being a Senator. You need to show good character, good judgment, and be willing to both (a) put in work individually, including grunt work and (b) work as part of a team of complex egos and relationships.

"https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-nike-deal-exceeds-1-billion-maverick-carter-says-2016-5   You cannot become anywhere near that level of rich without exploiting someone somewhere. LeBron has a billion dollar deal with a company famous for exploiting people. That’s how they make their money, and in turn that’s how he makes his money."
"No one is saying Lebron James should be Secretary of State. But he, along with dentists, plumbers, and you, are supposed to give your opinion about important issues of the day, and we all are supposed to weigh that opinion along with what we know of the person speaking. That’s how a republic is supposed to function.  Now, should celebrities have such a huge influence compared to dentists or plumbers? I’d rather they didn’t, but the solution to that is to raise up informed voices, not to silence people who happen to be great at basketball."
"When California had a ballot proposition to charge for bags, I asked one of my usual baggers what he thought. He had some good thoughts, although nothing groundbreaking. I did not look up any athletes’ opinions, but the Miami Heat’s Lebron James was  entitled to voice his option on the California bag proposal if he wanted to."

Most people don’t realize how much the Chinese government had an effect on Yao’s career. An 82 game NBA season is absolutely grueling for a normal NBA rotational player. Yao not only played heavy minutes but also was a focal point in the offense. Tack that all on a 7”6 325 pound man and it’s insane that he held up as long as he did. Even the most durable genetic freaks like LeBron James need a full-offseason to rest and recover.  What did Yao get? Full on balls to the wall off-season training camps for the Chinese National team where he’s not only playing basketball as the face of a nation but doing stupid ass conditioning drills like suicides. They absolutely ran him ragged and it’s likely caused the wear and tear on his feet. I’m absolutely certain that if Yao were able to opt out of National team duties and load manage like many players do today that he would of had another 5 years of 20PPG/10RPG production.

People choosing who to vote for based on Lebron James’ opinion should not be voting.
Senator James will happen if the man wants it to. He has the talent. He's figuring out the political part while he plays. Bill Bradley did it and LeBron is already better at some parts of politics than he was (and Bradley was a presidential candidate.)
https://www.si.com/.amp/nba/2019/09/17/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-lebron-james-dan-gilbert-best-feuds-decade  https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/11/23/16693586/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-fight-thunder-warriors  https://sports.cbslocal.com/2017/02/17/keidel-the-simmering-durant-westbrook-feud/amp/  https://thunderousintentions.com/2019/09/22/okc-thunder-russell-westbrook-kevin-durant/amp/  There’s a bunch of articles documenting their feud. They play nice for the cameras because they’re professionals not trying to cause trouble for their teams. I think someone’s just a little salty that OKC couldn’t get past LeBron in 2013 or that they blew a 3-1 lead in 2016. Too bad you don’t have a banner to cry into because your only championship was won 41 years ago for a city that’s 1500 miles away and doesn’t even hang in your arena.
"Larry Bird had back problems and was a shell of his former self, but Magic Johnson was healthy and rested and 32 years old.  He was HIV positive but he didn't have AIDS and he wasn't sick.  And the loss of Michael Jordan is major.  Basketball is a sport where one GOAT can be worth more than three superstars.  For that reason I would pick the Redeem Team of 2008 as the second best Olympic men's basketball team.  LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwight Howard were close to the peaks of their powers.  Add veteran stars like Kobe Bryant and Jason Kidd, and at the end of the bench you just have All-Stars Michael Redd, Chris Bosh and Carlos Boozer.  After the losses in 2004, the 2008 team was highly motivated and well coached by Mike Krzyzewski"
"That's my take away too. The league didn't suddenly stop giving a shit about a forward's skill set at long as they could drive and do chasedown blocks after LeBron hit his prime. Look at the team compositions in 2014 vs. 2020.  To be clear, I'm firmly in the LeBron James as GOAT, but MJ and Curry undoubtedly shifted things more than LeBron."
"It’s pretty justified imo. The amount of actual $$$ Lebron James adds by himself to the NBA is nothing compared to the amount of power he has in the NBA. In terms of basketball it’s the same; the amount of wins a team will increase just by having Lebron is worth bending over to Lebron. Lebron James is the NBA and w/out him, the NBA is going to lose a lot of $$$."
"Overrated: Jayson Tatum, dame, Bradley Beal, Kawhi, and Jamal Murray.    Jayson Tatum is amazing but I think fans are starting to get ahead of themselves, he’s still pretty inconsistent. Dame has built a reputation and a playoff performer based on 2 shots, when the reality is his performance drops in the playoffs, mainly because of his lack of off ball skill. Beal is the definition of a good player on a bad team putting up really good stats which makes him look better than he is. Kawhi is no longer the defender he used to be. He should have been the guy to take on doncic and Murray in the playoffs and he didn’t. Also his shooting has regressed. Murray is another spectacular talent, who is currently being overrated because he just had on of the most insane playoff runs in recent years. His shooting is going to regress to the mean and people are going to be like “what happened?”. He’s still fantastic though.   Overhated: Ben Simmons, James harden, Giannis, PG, and Trae young.   Ben Simmons gets hated because he can’t shoot, which causes people to overlook he is THE best defender in NBA, an elite rebounding guard, and a really good play maker. If he was in a system that wasn’t shit and had teammates that fit his playstyle, he could play similar to Giannis. James harden simply gets too much criticism. It’s that simple. I used to be a hater, and then one day I realized how insane the hatred towards him is. If NBA fan favorites like Dame put up numbers like him in the playoffs, you would never here the end of how amazing they are and how it’s just a lackluster supporting cast. But when harden does it it’s “yea but he lost to GS/LAL. What a choker.” Giannis has become underrated at this point because the pendulum swung to far. He went from overrated to underrated within the span of the bubble because he got “exposed”. Here’s a fun fact for you, LeBron got “exposed” in the 2007 finals by SA because he didn’t have a reliable jumper and they built a wall. Guess what? He got a jumper and became unguardable. He was simply young, just like Giannis. Giannis has shown progress in his jump shot. He will be back and we will be the best player in the NBA in a year or two. PG is hated because he has a shitty personality and can never seem to say the right thing. It’s fun making fun of him but people have internalized it to the point they think he’s actually bad. Trae young gets hated because everyone loves Luka (deservedly) and that trade sticks in peoples mind. That connection will always be there and luka will always be better. If Trae had a solid team he’d make the playoffs and people would actually watch him play. If you watch hawks games you know how good he is."
"KAT is not a top 15 player. He isn't top 20. LeBron James, Luca Doncic, Giannis, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Jason Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Brad Beal, kawhi Leonard, Paul George, the joker, Jamal Murray, CP3, Dame Dash. That's twenty and I have another dozen who might be better."
LeBron James is the single greatest and most impactful player in (team) sports history.
"The thing about the rockets is that you don't need to change it. Westbrook can work with a center and still attack the rim and not to mention you have James Harden complimenting Yao Ming. Yao Ming can protect the pain against AD and his presence inside will leave the shooters free to score or for westbrook to attack and score/lob/kick it out to a shooter. With an actual traditional big and one of the best to do it, Lebron and AD can't bully the rockets as much and the shooters on the Rockets &gt; shooters on the Lakers."
"Averaging it out based on rank, this is the positioning of everyone who qualified for both sides, ordered tie-breakers by higher peak.   1.0 - LeBron James (1/1)  4.0 - Steph Curry (2/6)  5.5 - Chris Paul (7/4)  6.0 - Kawhi Leonard (10/2)  6.5 - Giannis Antetokounmpo (3/10)  6.5 - Russell Westbrook (5/8)  6.5 - Kevin Durant (8/5)  6.5 - James Harden (6/7)  7.0 - Nikola Jokic (11/3)  9.0 - Anthony Davis (9/9)  15.5 - Derrick Rose (20/11)  15.5 - Jimmy Butler (15/16)  18.0 - Kyrie Irving (16/20)  18.5 - Draymond Green (25/12)  19.0 - Paul George (17/21)  23.5 - Kyle Lowry (23/24)"
"LeBron, Wade, Kobe, CP3, AI, Shaq, KD, KG, Tim Duncan, James Harden, ~~probably~~ Curry?"
"listing his accolades doesnt make him any less overrated lol  no other player in nba history has ever impacted the game like lebron james and michael jordan. kareem included. his longevity is unmatched, and he did dominate the weakest era in the nba. but he wasn't jordan/lebron. and because so many people try and act like he's ""underrated in the GOAT conversation,"" he is overrated."
Look I appreciate the civility but the Lakers deserve all the bullshit. They'd still go to the Finals anyway they have Lebron James.
"&gt; the word for a trait can’t give context to something?  Saying something has a trait without giving the context for why you believe that to be so means that statement doesn’t have context on its own. If it doesn’t have anything to do with what someone said, it doesn’t have any context that justifies its place in the discussion. If I said “Lebron James fucking sucks” in a forum about Steph Curry’s MVP season then that would sound like an unsolicited opinion wouldn’t it.   &gt; what do you mean the year gives context, the year is a measurement of time in a definite form  It’s silly how people have to explain to you why a period of time isn’t the same as a descriptive trait like toxicity. One gives an idea context, and the other is part of an idea that would need and usually have context like a period of time or an experience you had. The comment he was replying to explains the context wherein he made his comment, but the statement he made wasn’t provided any context at all on its own.   &gt; that makes zero sense... what has been written before the comment  I’m talking about the statement he made. The comment about Steph Curry fans is context to what he was replying to, but given that he was not referring to the same context it uses, the two ideas are only related by the second one’s comparative nature. At best, that could constitute an idea having “context,” but it doesn’t count for much to work with honestly. Again, the best “discussion” to be had is apparently a long winded argument you were apparently super eager to take part in today.  &gt; I’ve answered this...  You’d probably be the only one here that thinks he wasn’t actually saying the other half of what he was saying, which was that the commenter was acting like Lebron fans weren’t a problem. I get it, you think the exact same opposite thing but in my direction, but this isn’t a point you can prove by just repeating it over and over.   &gt; Why would you ask that when you are just as persistent?  Because, shits boring and I’m curious why you think it’s fun. Like, you’ve been all over the place being passive aggressive, putting words in my mouth as if I said anyone was a jackass or that I was exalting the first comment. And at the end of the day when I said “it’s fine if we don’t see things the same way” somehow you’re still ready and willing to write dissertations and shit lol. But it’s fair, I’ve been doing the same thing and you have to make your day fun I guess   So far, all I’ve gotten is that we have different ideas of what context is, I think the comments aren’t the same and you do, and you enjoy engaging in long threads. We’re not going to convince each other of anything. I’ve pretty much said what I needed to say, and if you’d like to rehash anything I’ve said so far, go ahead man. Do it for the dopamine boost or something lol, I’m done here though."
"I was curious so I searched single season and playoff BPMs, here's what they consider the ""top 25"" in each, I think averaging it would produce a pretty decent list.

OP is shorter than LeBron James
"as it turns out, I am also shorter than LeBron James"
"&gt;Lol I listened to the same podcast you did, and Tillman is the implied bad guy there (if there is one).  I didn't say anyone was a *bad guy*, just that Morey was forced to do a trade he didn't want to, and that he correctly judged to make the team worse.   &gt;""James Harden changed my life.""  I don't think there's any doubt that Harden changed his life. He single handedly made the Rockets a contending team, of course that's a massive factor for someone in charge of their front office.  It's possible to have two thoughts in ones head at the same time. You can appreciate what Harden did for the franchise and also have an issue with the 'baggage' that comes with that.   I bet every single front office employee that has ever worked for a team with LeBron James on the team has a book full of stories to tell about the troubles LeBron and his entourage has created. Does that mean they don't appreciate the ring(s) he brought them? Of course not.  &gt;of a second-hand account on a podcast segment  There's a couple of things here. First of all, while you're not wrong that it *is* second-hand account, I think you're dismissing how close these reporters are to both players and staff. These are people that hang out on a regular basis, they have dinners and drinks, etc.   Zach Lowe, and absolutely anyone else in his position knows ten times more than what they're reporting on. The on-the-record to off-the-record ratio is like an ice berg. You're only seeing the tip.   &gt;over the words of the guy himself, then I don't know what to tell you.  You don't need to tell me anything, I've worked as a lawyer helping corporate big wigs prepare their public statements enough to know that anyone in that position with a semi-functioning brain will know how to say the right thing, whether or not that's a genuine representation of their opinion or not. Except the hand full of idiots who do a Comic Sans burn notice.   And again - it's possible for Morey to have two differing thoughts in his mind at once. People generally handle that fine."
You say this like AD isn't playing with LeBron James.
Is 'LeBron James Sucks' really the best insult they could come up with?
So how do Cavs fans who support Trump feel about Lebron James?
"If I were as good at basketball as Lebron James and also 6'8"" and very athletic I'd be really good"
Bigots in the crowd wish they were LeBron James 😂😂😂😂😂
Sounds like a mixture of LeBron James sucks or Biden sucks. They probably were a mix of both actually lmao
Lebron James sucks
"""LeBron James sucks"""
"LeBron James gets triple doubles, Trump looks like all he eats are double doubles"
Ima get downvoted cause this thread is full of stephews.   Lebron James 36 ppg. Mozgov 14 ppg.   Curry is the reason the Warriors lost two games. If he played well all series it would've been a sweep.   Lebron deserved that Finals MVP and you all know it.   You guys are just salty Curry will never be put in the pantheon of players you guys think he should be with.
"Lebron James  He's all the media talks about and everyone understands he's one of the greatest of all time, but the amount of times people claim he's disrespected is mind boggling. He dominates a playoff game and you have people saying, ""See? I told you so."" Like people don't understand he's good at basketball."
Jesus Christ it’s ~~Jason Bourne~~ Lebron James covering that guys back
"Did you read the article, though?   &gt;While the Clippers talked a plethora of trash talk, so did the Lakers. For every instance of Patrick Beverley being an agitator, there was also instances of Dwight Howard being that same agitator. For the instances of the Clippers bench talking trash, there were far more instances of the Lakers bench talking trash. LeBron James openly posted on Instagram about how excited he was to destroy his competition. The only difference is that the Lakers handled their business all season and won the championship."

"Could THIS team win a title:     - Allen Iverson   - Michael Jordan    - LeBron James   - Tim Duncan    - Shaquille O'Neal     Not enough space on the floor, imo"
"I read MJ had a 48 inch vertical and Lebron a 44 inch.  “Jordan jumps 5 inches higher than Vince Carter, 4 inches higher than James, and an incredible 20 inches higher than the NBA average.”"
"Im not mad, its just weird. Its like making a top 10 list and forgetting LeBron james."
"LeBron has had PLENTY of help the truth about LeBron James is he cant play in an ACTUAL system and thats why he only has 4 championships instead of ten already, LeBron hasnt had a bad team since his third year in the league!! The man gets to handpick his rosters and fools say he had ZERO help whenever he loses  If LeBron would sacrifice his stats in favor of team systems he wouldnt have been swept twice and have the biggest meltdown in NBA FINALS HISTORY  ALL FACTS"
"LBJ's career started the night of May 31, 2007 at the Palace of Auburn Hills at about 9:30 pm.      With 6:30 left in game 5 with the series tied 2-2, Lebron makes a long jump shot to put the Cavs up 81-78. Over the next 3 minutes, Detroit goes on a 10-0 run to take a 88-81 lead with 3 minutes to go. Slowly, but surely James makes bucket after bucket and all of a sudden the Cavs take an 89-88 lead with just 30 seconds left. Down by 1, Chauncey Billups hits the go-a-head 3 before James come back down and scores to tie the game with just seconds remaining to send the game into OT 91-91.      In the first OT, James and the Pistons trade buckets and we find ourselves headed to a second OT at 100-100. In the 2nd OT, the Pistons find themselves up 107-104 with about a minute to go before James hits a long 3 to tie the game up. After a few missed chances on offense for the Pistons, James comes down and scores the game winning bucket with 1 second remaining to win the game 109-107. From when in was 88-84 Pistons with under 3 minutes left in the game, Lebron James took his first game over and scored 25 consecutive points."

"seems like trying to apply a narrative to some injury randomness  if they'd gone from a 7-game series to the finals and those same injuries happened, people would say ""oh yeah, they were tired and their bodies gave out""  we talk about LeBron James' conditioning a lot, but the truth is there have been a lot of players who took excellent care of their bodies and played fewer minutes but then got seriously hurt. Because luck is also a huge factor in sports (and everything else) but we don't like to include that in our explanatory narratives because it gives the rest of explanation we do have control over less power"
"There’s a difference between Bron getting hammered every five seconds with no calls ever, so he ends up exaggerating   And blatant Marcus Smart type shit   Either way they’re both shit, and should be fined appropriately  Let’s go ahead n stop the “Lebron is tHE bIgGeST fLOppEr In tHe gAmE wHaYUMean???” Train....  Any actual fan of the game knows who flops and who exaggerates from time to time, both should be penalized, but there’s a big difference between how it’s done and how often it’s done as well   It’s just like the Reggie Miller or James harden rule implementing, until they start enforcing the flop rule harder, players are going to exploit it unfortunately"
"Clippers also play in los Angeles and have never even played in the WCF. It matters how the organization is run.    If you are going to talk about the incompetency of people running multi-billion dollar organizations then at least use correct grammar when criticizing them. That has nothing to do with me being on a high horse. Again, you continually misuse words/phrases. I think it’s an intelligence issue not a ‘haha I’m not gonna use proper language/grammar because this is reddit’ issue.    In 2011 they beat LeBron James. That dude is still pretty relevant and is still definitely in the league last I checked. Again, 2011 is not ancient history. You are trying to claim that some meaningless playoff series in 2015 is a relevant (and recent) achievement yet one from 2011 is absolutely pointless. Players come and go but banners hang forever, bud.    You are tryna critique the competency of the Lakers when they went 10 years without a title. Yet you are screaming from the rooftops about how successful your franchise is when they haven’t even played in the finals in 25 years.    Just because you say that your franchise is successful does not mean that it is. You have no picks and expiring/aging assets, you just fired your coach, you just fired your GM, and your owner is a notoriously cheap bastard who is rumored to have money issues. If you think that amounts to success then I don’t know what to tell you."
"Should it be someone whose main position is PF? Or just someone who CAN play PF and have played mostly the 4 in at least one season? If it's the latter, here's my 13 man lineup.  **PG:** Lebron James, Boris Diaw   **SG:** Rashard Lewis, Connie Hawkins, Elgin Baylor   **SF:** Giannis Antetokounmpo, Charles Barkley   **PF:** Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Webber, Chris Bosh   **C:** Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Anthony Davis"
"The 2011 Heat had pretty much the same advantage over the League that GSW had in 2017. You may argue otherwise but their INTENTION was to be much better than the rest and win a lot of titles. Were did I say that Cleveland 2010 were on the same level as OKC in 2016? Cleveland were the 1st seed back to back years, compared to the rest of the League they were what .. 2nd favorite to win the title? OKC in 2016 were 4th behind GSW, SA and Cleveland. You wanna tell me that there was that big of difference between James in 2010 and Durant in 2016? It's pathetic to criticize Kevin for something that your favorite did in the pretty much the same situation. Not to mention that the League wasn't as stacked in 2010. Also you wanna tell me that someone with the Ego of Lebron, someone that sits on 0 titles and chase Jordan's 6 just went for Miami to win 1 or 2 titles?! This is just revisionist history. GSW won the same titles in more dominant fashion and less tries. They didn't win the 3rd because Klay and Looney got injured as well. That is like 3 players from the top 6 rotation wise. Did Miami miss 3 players from their top 6 in 2011 or 2014? In order for you to understand how stacked were the Heat - they completely outplayed Chicago Bulls simply because of star power and the fact that Rose was lacking second star and volume scorer. Heat had THREE of them."
"Their* - you’re not even competent enough to use proper grammar, I don’t think you’re in any position to judge the competency of a basketball organization.    We won a championship last decade yet people like to point to that time period as one of incompetence. Lakers paid Kobe out the ass for us to be mediocre for years because we take care of our own. That decision directly aided in us acquiring the talents of one LeBron James.    You point to winning a playoff series 5 years ago as something that shows how successful your organization is yet a championship from 9 years ago is ancient history. Only cringe thing here is you acting a fool and racking up these Ls."
i want lebron james to show everyone that he's a championship player
"&gt;He is to "" blame"" when 9 of his Finals are him jumping on a Super team(not once, not twise but htree times) and his record is still 4-5 in those  Let's see.   2007 Cavs - 0-1 not a superteam  2011 Heat - 0-2 1st year of the superteam, his fault  2014 Heat - 2-3 last year of ""superteam"", every Heat player not named LeBron James looked like they didn't belong in the finals, not his fault. Even if Heat played like in 2013, did you even see how fucking good the Spurs were?  2015 Cavs - 2-4 1st year of Love-Kyrie superteam, both got injured and he took the eventual champs to 6 games with Delly-Mozgov as the substitutes for the trio, not his fault  2017 Cavs - 2-5 I only need to say KD-GSW  2018 Cavs - 2-6 that Cavs had the offensive talent of the 2007 team but none of the defense, 1 of the best hard carries I've seen from a player. Not his fault  &gt;Its different if he stayed only in Cleveland or Miami but he constanly hunts the Best possible situations for him to win  He stayed in Cleveland for 7 years and he saw that they were not interested in giving him the proper help he needs.  WHAT KIND OF COMPETITOR WOULD LOOK FOR THE BEST SITUATION FOR HIM TO WIN?! DISGUSTING lmao you really thought you were saying something that's supposed to be against him huh  Miami was a success. 2 rings in 4 y"

"When I first started getting into the NBA, lebrons ""chosen one"" magazine came out, and I remember searching lebron james on YouTube and was amazed at his talent. Started following lebron then he got drafted to Cleveland, I'd watch his games almost every night I could after school and basketball practice. Started learning about other teams and other players, started playing the NBA live games and later 2k games. Learned the history over the time and just fell in love with the league"
he's gonna give this LeBron James guy a career
At least LeBron this year proved to everyone he could win without James Jones
Did you see how Kyrie did in his only playoffs without lebron james? He was absolutely terrible.
"I think a good indicator for casual fans is jersey sales. This was the list for top jersey sales in 2020:   LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers   Luka Dončić, Dallas Mavericks   Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers   Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics   Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks   Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors   Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets   Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers   Kawhi Leonard, LA Clippers   Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat   Kemba Walker, Boston Celtics   Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets   Russell Westbrook, Houston Rockets   Nikola Jokić, Denver Nuggets   Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies   Literally none of these are inefficient scorers that don’t do much else."
lebron james
I can't be the only one who read the title as LeBron James...
That's why I can never take Lebron that seriously. He's always had James Jones on his team who's never had a losing record.
"Im a super Dirk fan so Im going to defend Dirk here. Everyone here keeps bringing other stars who have a worse cast than Dirk. People forgot that ultimately he won the chip. My first argument is their second best scorer that time is Caron Butler who I think average 20 pts something at that time. Losing the second best scorer is a big blow to a team like that. And Ive read an article where the 8th out of ten true shooting percentage player at least played 10 min per game in Mavs is Butler. The 9 and 10? Terry and Barea. Second argument would be their opponent. Every team they played against are stacked, maybe except for the Blazers. Everyone thinks that Dallas will be a second round exit, and truthfully, only Dallas fan thinks that its not. Think about it,  post champ Lakers, Up and coming Thunder and a freaking beast Heat. And still won. Look at Dirks shooting splits that time. Monster is an understatement.   The point here is its not about who has the worst cast but who has the the worst cast but still won the chip. Lebron, AI and KG might have the worse team than Dirk but ultimately he still won agains very great competetion. Dirk still put up crazy fucking efficiency with subpar cast. He carried them against Aldridge, Kobe, Pau, Bynum, KD, Russ, Harden, Ibaka, James, Wade and Bosh. And again. HE. STILL. WON.   Sorry for long comment. Not really a good english speaker."
"Depends on what I'm feeling in that moment, if it's "" Oh my God! It's LeBron James! "" I'll kiss him back but if it's "" Oh. It's LeBron James. "" I'll just politely decline"
"If Lakers got Holiday, David Griffin is definitely a planted agent by LeBron James."
"&gt; Individual defense is overvalued on this sub. Scheme matters way more, but neither matters nearly as much as offense.  Not really, in the case of role players those that lack defense become liabilities because stars already create so much surplus value on an offense built around them.   In the case of star players elite defense is why James Harden/Curry can play better offensively than Lebron but Lebron can go to 10 straight finals games and create quantifiable impact far greater than theirs."
You try dragging Lebron James and Dwayne Wade up and down the court for 48 minutes.
So a LeBron James stat lol
"""I'll tell you what makes me thirsty...""-Lebron James"
lebron has always considered kidd one of his biggest mentors.  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/1/17/21070695/lakers-news-lebron-james-jason-kidd-relationship-frank-vogel-job  https://www.stack.com/a/lebron-reveals-the-one-retired-player-he-wishes-he-couldve-played-with-most-hint-its-not-mj-magic-or-wilt
"Oscar: If LeBron James tried to kiss you and you resisted, he would still have to get to you?  OP: It's just a scenario."
Your team is in some deep shit if it's built around a 3rd option PG that cant shoot. Look at all the teams Rondo has been on in recent years without Lebron James.
Kidd and it's not even close.  When lebron james was asked if he could have played with any player ALL TIME there was a reason he said Jason Kidd.
"Yeah, LeBron James is the best player to have worn a Heat Jersey.. but Dwayne Wade is arguable the best Heat due to his tenure and accomplishments with and without James on the team."
"To be honest, 07 Cavs shouldn’t even have been there . It would be a better match up between Pistons vs Spurs in terms of casts, experiences, and coaches. The only variable was LeBron James who just couldn’t let it go and used all of his energy on that historical  ECF 7 games"
"I agree 100%. People don’t take context into account when it comes to scoring. In LeBrons fourth year, he averaged 31.4 ppg and didn’t win scoring title. Melo won a scoring title averaging 29 ppg. Does that mean Melo scored more than James?   And then the biggest thing that people ignore that you mentioned is the amount of shots per game. For his career, LeBron averages 27 on 19.6 shots per game. Jordan at 30 on 22.9 shots per game. Is averaging 3 more points on more than 3 more shots per game really better?"
He didn't really do anything wrong outside of maybe 2018 because the Raptors weren't gonna succeed as long as LeBron was there. Them getting swept in 2018 could be put on DeMar a bit but it's really not his fault his team kept matching up with LeBron fucking James
"In modern hoops, no doubt. Maybe one of the teams from the 60’s was worse, but how the hell would we know?  People love to point out that LeBron is 4-6 in the NBA Finals, and how he’s lost more. The fact he dragged that team to the finals at 22 years old - that’s a win?  Die hard pistons fan here. That year hurt. That was basically the end for us. We were beat by Lebron James and Boobie Gibson. 🙄"
"I agree with you, people really underestimate prime Dwight. Only player in NBA history to win 3 straight DPOY. He was a freak of nature and the only player who was undisputedly above him in his absolute prime (2008-2012) was LeBron James. Overall career wise, Ewing is above Dwight, but in their peaks Howard&gt;Ewing."
"It’s like Lebron and Wade in Miami. Wade is greatest Heat player of all time, yet Lebron James is the most talented player to ever don a Heat jersey."
"Slumbering Joseph is your president and LeBron James is your NBA champion. Stay mad, lmao"
"It's kind of weird how underrated McHale is.   Most of the time, the 3rd star in an all time great big 3 is the player who gets overshadowed by the top 2 players. Like you said, James Worthy was overshadowed by Magic and Kareem. Bosh was overshadowed by LeBron and D-Wade, and I would honestly say Tony Parker doesn't get the respect he deserves out of the Spurs big 3.   But McHale was the second best player on one of the greatest teams of all time. Yeah, he had Bird, McHale really isn't mentioned as part of ""one of their top 2 players"", more so as part of the Big Three, with Parish. Obviously Parish was a great player as well, but still"
"it'll be tough, but if they're being tested i could see it     it'll be an amazing PR opportunity for the NBA and the white house, lebron james is a massive name in and out of the league and a democrat supporter, the democrats will want it too"
That day it was truly LeBron James against the Pistons.  His performance was equivalent to Michael Jordan's performance against the Celtics on the day he scored 63 points.  The only difference was that Michael Jordan had to bow out to the Celtics after two overtime games.  LeBron James had managed to beat the Pistons.
"&gt;LeBron James' Northeast Ohio voted Trump  That's what you wrote.  I said:   Not all of Northeast Ohio voted Trump.  Lebron James is from Summit County.   And you come off as blaming Ohio for voting Trump and not Indiana, Kentucky, Florida, South Carolina, West Virginia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah and probably Alaska and North Carolina.   Who's the slow one now?"
"Your post:  &gt;. but lets not forget lebron was blaming jewish people during this whole election  The article:  &gt;LeBron James' silence is particularly notable this month, since he was criticized in 2018 for quoting lyrics from 21 Savage's song ""ASMR"" on his Instagram story, writing: ""We been getting that Jewish money, Everything is Kosher."" James later apologized, saying he didn't realize the lyrics were offensive and perpetuated Jewish stereotypes.  You're a fucking liar."
You're lying about what Lebron James did. Your initial post is still up there. Fuck off with that shit.
"I think it's funny anyone thinks he would be more dominant than Steph Curry, LeBron, and James Harden. Homie had Kobe for 3 of his championships. He would not be more dominant than LeBron James. Not sure why anyone would think he would be more dominant than LeBron or KD in an era where bigs are no longer the focus of the offense. Do you have any comments on the actual game or differences in era? Youre just flinging an ad hominem really. Not an argument."
Lebron james is only from Summit County.   All major Ohio cities voted Biden and the rural voted Trump.  A trend across all of America.
LeBron James' Northeast Ohio voted Trump
"That ain’t make y’all comment stronger about Detroit being #1 seed 52 wins in the EAST “which was weak”. For the record, Cavs was about 50 wins and LeBron had a legendary trash cast. Detroit was the defending champ and arguably the best defensive team in the league at the time. On another side, LeBron was in any team but Cavs in whatever East or West, he might had already gotten a chip  I know pretty much every game and failure of LeBron James. But there’s nothing to diminish his greatness of 07 playoffs performance. Instead, Giannis has EVER NEVER proved himself during playoffs period"
I’m existing and y’all a bigger joke to even reply my shit comment. That’s a disgusting thing to see y’all flair being “LeBron James” who ain’t NEVER give a shit about a downvoting comment just coz it’s “safe” to reply. Midget
Old enough to watch the whole career of LeBron James
"""LeBron James is the only player to score 30 points on a Wednesday while it's raining"""

Giannis is phenomenal. The best player in the world in lebron. One of the best scorers ever james harden. Jimmy Butler. Booker. Demar. Mitchell. Ja. Lavine. Simmons. Russ.
Lebron James will be at the White House next year. But not Donny boy lol.
"Literally how is this a post about the nba , all of a sudden every fucking tweet/ Instagram post from lebron James is news worthy?  Like I get that the election is a big issue but cmon,"
LeBron James should leave the country
"So by that logic the 2018 Cavs weren't contenders, right? Because they got swept by the Warriors. The Blazers aren't contenders, right? Cause they got swept.  The east was weak, yes. But you can't compare a team that had been to the playoffs for 5 straight years, losing only to Lebron James, to the 'bad teams' OP says Kawhi never played for. Those teams are so bad that their stars had to drag them TO the playoffs, and those teams were not good enough to win a championship with. The Raptors before Kawhi were a perennial playoff team. While Kawhi was on the team they made major improvements to the roster, win now moves they wouldn't have made without Kawhi being there, but that never the less made them a good team without him.   You want to say the Raptors weren't a championship caliber team without Kawhi? Duh. You want to say they weren't even a finals contending team without him? Fine. But don't say they were on-par with the kinds of teams OP is talking about, teams that would be bottom feeders without their stars. This Raps team without Kawhi was 2nd in a top-heavy eastern conference"
"This remains one of the most amazing performances I've ever personally witnessed.   As mentioned in the original post, it wasn't just the fact he was scoring, it was *how* he was scoring. It was so magical and compelling that it nearly transcended my displeasure with watching the Pistons lose. I just remember every next trip down the floor, the Pistons throwing the kitchen sink at him and LeBron finding these new, 1-vs.-5 ways to score on highly difficult shots.   It remains the only time in my life where I had literally zero doubt that a game-winning play was forthcoming and inevitable.   As an aside, the Pistons were without Ben Wallace (free agency) and Antonio McDyess (ejected) but James was so incredible that I have a feeling little would have changed had they been there."
"LeBron James: “Come on, Commish, this is a quick turnaround... December 22nd? No way!”  Adam Silver: “Okay, whatever you say... I guess MJ really is the GOA-“  LeBron: “IT’S A WHOLE NEW GAME PART 2!”"
Just shut up serve your prison term -Lebron James probably
"&gt;@realDonaldTrump Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!    &gt;@KingJames U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!   &gt;@realDonaldTrump Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart, which isn’t easy to do. I like Mike!   &gt;October of 2020. The President joined Rush Limbaugh for a wide-ranging interview ahead of Election Day. During their discussion, Trump labeled James as a “hater” and “nasty spokesman” for the Democratic party. ""LeBron has been a spokesman, I don’t know I’ve never met him, all I know is when he endorsed Hillary,” Trump said. “LeBron is a spokesman for the Democratic party. A very nasty spokesman.”   &gt;November 2, 2020. Just one day before the presidential election, Trump supporters at a Pennsylvania rally came together in a collective bash on LeBron James.  &gt;As Trump spoke about media ratings being down across all platforms of sport, a chant began to ring out from the crowd. “LeBron James sucks… LeBron James sucks…”     lmfao at this beef"
Lol the trade is for CP3. Not Lebron James . There two best players and the 8th pic for Chris fucking paul's fat contract.
"I see Jrue as easily a top 10 defender in the league, and I would love for him to be top 5, but he can’t be top 5, simply because he’s not 7’1 with a massive wingspan. Big men are still the most impactful defenders in the league, even though so much of the game now relies on perimeter offense.  With that being said, though, here’s why I think Jrue is still a top 10 defender:  His on ball defense is incredible. He’s quick enough to move his feet with guards, and strong enough at least hold his ground against big men.      Then his transition defense it fantastic as well. He is fast enough run with most guards on a break, but he’s bigger than most guards and able to block weak layups with his longer wingspan. He has great knowledge of how to pick and choose who to commit to on a break, and rarely gets caught in no man’s land, something that I think is underrated when discussing defense.  To me, where Jrue separates himself from other guards in the league is his post defense. I don’t know if there’s a “defensive bag” but if there is, then Jrue Holiday has it. He can front big men if they’re simply too strong for him, but like I said before, he is still very strong, so he can hold his ground on post-ups against most players in the league, similar to James Harden. If he does get stuck defending someone too big for him, he is incredible at pulling the chair, something that I haven’t seen anybody else in the league do with such regularity. On top of that, he’s also very skilled at stripping the ball from players if they hold it too low before they go up for a shot, although I would put Marcus Smart above Jrue in that category. Overall, though, I think it makes Jrue the best post-defending guard in the league (unless LeBron counts as a guard).  I think this all makes Jrue one of the best defensive guards in the league, if not the best, although Marcus Smart and Ben Simmons are arguable, and easily a top 10 defender overall."
"I'm not ""disregarding free throws"". I'm saying include another shooting efficiency stat to give a more complete picture as a scorer.  For instance, Chauncey Billups during his time in Detroit and Denver had a rTS% of **+5.9** but only a reg of **1.5**. By comparison, LeBron is +4 in both and Curry is +7 in both.  Or James Harden. In the RS James Harden has a rTS of +6.6 and a playoff rTS of +4.4. However his rEFG are +2.1 in the regular season and +0.0 in the playoffs. Would you describe Harden in the playoffs from what you have watched as an all time efficient scorer? Or someone that struggles to find the same efficacy as the regular season?  &gt;*To loosely quote Thinking Basketball's excellent video on the topic -- say, for example, a player shot 1-5 from the field but was fouled every time they went up the floor and made all 18 of their resulting free throws, they would essentially have had a fantastic offensive performance, scoring 23 points for their team's offense in just 14 offensive possessions, but someone judging them based off of their FG% alone would've come to the erroneous conclusion that they were having a horrible night, when in reality, they were generating points for their offense at an extremely efficient rate*  Right dude, and outside of a handful of players ever, the general rule is in the playoffs and important possessions, referring is going to be looser and you cannot expect to get the same foul calls you get in the 2nd quarter of a game in February.  I like Ben, but do we know if he ever **played** ball competitively?   &gt;*FTs usually rely on some combination of players i) being good at foul-baiting/ accentuating contact, ii) putting a lot of pressure on defenses from the paint/midrange etc.. All-time playoff scorers (the MJs, LeBrons, Shaqs, Dirks, KDs, Kobes etc.) pretty universally have excellent free-throw rates -- it's highly likely that they recognise that it's a pretty efficient way to rack up points*  MJ, LeBron, Shaq, Dirk, Kobe were all also net positives in rEFG and rTS. **Meaning, they were effective as overall shooters (incl free throws) or specifically as live ball scorer**.  Not sure why you seem to almost be getting offended I'm saying rTS isnt the perfect metric for all things scoring efficiency. Especially when I'm saying supplementing a secondary statistic gives rTS more context."
"Lmao read it all then at the end it goes to a “not as good as lebron”  You really a salty ass lebron fanboy who is gettin at kawhi when you really should be lookin at your guy.   Your guy “the greatest player in the world” lebron james hasn’t won shit until he teamed up with other top players in the league.   Let’s not forget his weak performances in USA basketball, earning bronze and silver LMAO until Kobe came in 2008 to pull USA out of the gutter.  Lebron cannot won without a superteam. Period.  He had a superteam in Miami, Cleveland, and arguably his best team now with the Lakers.   Lebron has made it the “norm” around the league for superstars to join each other in their primes. The competitiveness around the league has dropped considerably.   For you to judge kawhi for the teams he’s played on and give Lebrons the pass, you’re just a two faced dumbass"
"If you consider choking run into the Lebron James Cavs three years in a row, then I don’t know what to tell you. The fact is that if Lebron was still in the East, he would be routinely destroying the conference, whether it’s Toronto or the Celtics, so your fixation on the Raptors playoff record is absurd.  Kawhi never had to carry a team like the 2018 Cavs."
"I think that in terms of Usain Bolt, he's just a genetic GOAT. You can't inject his form and the way his body is built and shit. There's possibly some sloppy evidence of LeBron James taking PEDs, but also like you can't inject or teach being a 6'9"" hyper athletic point guard that can shoot from the logo and is super coordinated. Bolt taking PEDs is in the realm of possibility if you take what you say without context of Bolt as an athlete, but I mean if you watch the guy run, he's the fastest guy on the planet clearly and it doesn't look like a fluke, he doesn't look unnatural or anything, I don't doubt hes just built different. Anything is possible of course, but I personally think he's natty"
"My starting 5 would be:   PG: De'Aaron Fox, Trae Young  SG: James Harden, Devin Booker  SF: Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic  PF: LeBron James, Giannis Antentokounmpo  C: Bam Adebayo, Jusuf Nurkic  &amp;#x200B;  I know that this will be downvoted to hell because of my centre selections (Not Embiid, Jokic or Davis) but it's just my opinion"
"Boobie Gibson was the 3rd PG on the roster that year(for the majority of the season). Big Z was probably the next best player and they started Drew Gooden and Sasha Pavlovic. Generally, people don’t give older(past) role players the credit they deserve. No namers don’t make the books even if they were solid at the time. You cannot say that about the 06-07 cavs. They were truly a rag tag bunch of players that happened to have cavs uniforms on while Lebron James was swept in the nba finals."
LeBron James has taught him well.
Larry Bird is an immortal and I have him 6th all time but in no universe is he remotely close to being better than Lebron James.
"Advanced defensive metrics, like you said, are extremely unreliable (since the box score captures defense extremely poorly), while advanced offensive metrics have always been far more reliable  Re: rebounding, it's not even that advanced a stat - it's literally just the percentage of available rebounds a player grabbed while he was on the floor. Defense, on the other hand, is far harder to quantify using the box-score centric metrics which BBRef provides. Also, DPOY-shares aren't as subjective as you're making it seem --- i don't think anyone would disagree that Giannis/AD/Gobert are the best defenders in the NBA  If you'd like to compare their defense in more granular detail, feel free to dive into the film [here, for Bird](https://backpicks.com/2018/01/11/backpicks-goat-11-larry-bird/), and [here, for LeBron](http://www.backpicks.com/2018/04/05/backpicks-goat-3-lebron-james/)"
"&gt;Was LeBron James suddenly a worse player than Dwayne Wade or Dirk Nowitzki just because he played like a pylon in the 2011 Finals?  To some he was but just like Lebron, Kawhi can come back and shut everyone up. But until then he is going to get killed like Lebron did in 2011."
LOL imagine using two bad games of one series as evidence of one player being better or worse than another. Was LeBron James suddenly a worse player than Dwayne Wade or Dirk Nowitzki just because he played like a pylon in the 2011 Finals?
"There is no discussion on Lebron vs Jordan. MJ played back in the day when basketball was fun and it was physical as fuck. Most of you are probably under 30 years old, go watch some of the classics. Knicks/Pacers was a fucking gold mine. Reggie and Davis vs Starks and Oakley. That was real hoops. Not this pussified version thats been going on for decades. Up until the early 2000's, if you went to the rack, you paid the price. Jimmy Buckets and Steph would be pissing their shorts. Jordan is the GOAT, Bron is good and all. NBA used to be top notch with rivalries and physical play/fights. Now you blow on a guy and you get suspended for 6 games. Jordan took the beatings and he prospered. James takes a pinky and he cries"
Rubio  Ray Allen  Tracy McGrady  LeBron James  Karl Malone
"The best indicator for higher volume 3 point shooting is ft%. He would have 6 month with Ray Allen to get his 3 pointer on line. Gervin has a really nice 2-point percentage for a 2/3 guard in the 70s.  I have them how they would defend (other than Gervin, I would only trust Rubio to defend PGs over a whole game and Bird probably has to defend 4s, despite being thinner than James). The passers are Lebron and Bird."

"Man, I bet it's incredibly fun being LeBron James."
"Gervin Allen James Bird Mutombo  Edit: Not having the Iceman until now in any comment is kinda ridiculous. Can play off ball or create for himself and a bit for others, is the best perimeter defender besides Rubio and Lebron. His 3 point shot would be ok considering his ft%."
"---  note-   - using just **playoff** numbers, which matter the most when it comes to championship equity  - using **per 75** scoring numbers ([short explanation](https://i.imgur.com/JtHgJ4A.png)): helps adjust for changes in pace between eras  - using **relative true shooting % (rTS%)**, which is basically era-edjusted scoring efficiency ([short explanation](https://i.imgur.com/uijhOi7.png))  ---  &gt;Lebron might be a better scorer as a driver, but Bird is a better scorer at every other level by a wide margin while also being very good around the rim  ""might be a better scorer as a driver"" doesn't give James enough credit: he was the most efficient volume rim-finisher for two decades in a row: [2000s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szqr8Ey60uI&amp;t=1m1s); [2010s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_kpneFm5hU&amp;t=26s). That gives him a huge margin for error when it comes to his scoring from the other areas on the court, and [when you combine playoff scoring volume and efficiency](https://player.fm/series/thinking-basketball/ep-50-top-scorers-in-nba-history-revisited), he pretty handily beats everyone except Jordan.  - *In no particular order, Bird's 3 best PLAYOFF scoring seasons vs LeBron's (minimum conference finals)*:  Season| Bird | Season| LeBron ---|---|----|---- 1983-84| 24.2 points per 75, +6.7 rTS% | 2013-14| 30.0 points per 75, +12.0 rTS% 1985-86| 22.1 points per 75, +7.2 rTS%| 2017-18| 31.9 points per 75, +6.4 rTS% 1986-87| 22.7 points per 75, +2.8 rTS%| 2008-09| 35.6 points per 75, +7.4 rTS%  It's... yeah, there's a pretty big gap there.  These were easily Bird's most efficient postseasons, too -  **[his scoring volume *and* efficiency both skydived precipitously in the playoffs compared to other superstars (Thinking Basketball link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtL_zCF6qgQ&amp;t=3m25s)**   --- this is in stark contrast compared to [LeBron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtL_zCF6qgQ&amp;t=5m19s), whose playoff scoring efficiency only dipped slightly compared to his regular seasons despite increased volume, or [Jordan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtL_zCF6qgQ&amp;t=7m30s), whose playoff efficiency actually *improved* from his regular seasons *alongside* increased volume (the moral of the story here is that Jordan is a freak)  ---  &gt;Bird is a better rebounder  True, but not by much at all! Certainly not enough (for me at least) to use it as a reason as to why Bird was better. LeBron's career playoffs TRB% is 13.0%, while Bird's is 13.9%. Averaging their 3 best rebounding postseasons gives --- Bird: 16.8%, LeBron: 15.5%. Pretty darn close  ---  &gt;Both are good defenders. Lebron might be capable of being a better defender, but Bird was no slouch and didn't take large stretches of the season and games off on that end  LeBron wasn't just *capable* of being a better defender - he *was* a better defender whose defensive peak was also way higher. Bird never appeared on a single DPOY ballot *(he had 6 high level seasons since the award was introduced in 1983 to try and do so)* his entire career while LeBron finished 2nd twice; LeBron has 6 All-Defensive appearances *(5 1st-team)* to Bird's 3 *(0 1st-team)*.   [LeBron's effort on defense dialed down from 2014 onwards](http://www.backpicks.com/2018/04/05/backpicks-goat-3-lebron-james/) *(with a brief resurgence in the 2016 playoffs --- he churned out career best defensive intensity and metrics during the 16 postseason)* but including his 2009-2013 seasons + [his excellent 2020 defensive revival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhNTtyAR--Q), he's had **6** high-level defensive seasons, which is more than Bird ever had (and even in LBJ's 2nd Cleveland stint + 1st Lakers year, [he was far from a *negative* on that end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsxlu7nYdhU); he was at minimum a neutral and at best a positive, which is where I'd rank the majority of Bird's defensive performances).  ---  You were objectively correct about Bird's shooting being on a completely different plane to LeBron's, and I can definitely see their playmaking being similarly good ([though I'd still give an edge to LeBron](https://player.fm/series/thinking-basketball/ep-23-top-playmakers-in-nba-history)).   The rest of your points are all a matter of opinion -- for me, [LeBron's playoff numbers and overall impact on winning](http://www.backpicks.com/2018/04/05/backpicks-goat-3-lebron-james/), both peak- and longevity-wise, dwarf [Bird's](https://backpicks.com/2018/01/11/backpicks-goat-11-larry-bird/)"

I just don't understand the math.  &gt; Andrew Sharp of SI.com has a great take on the Warriors.  &gt; LeBron James? He'd probably sign  I’m honesty super impressed."
"Imagine him yelling and swearing at Lebron James or any other NBA superstar.  That's why he won't be a part of NBA, ever."
"LeBron James came to my bedroom last night. We sat on the bed together.  He got down on one knee, opened his mouth to speak, but he did not have to say a thing.  I knew what he was going to say.  ""Who am I going to play with next season?""  ""Jimmy Butler.""  I smiled.  Jimmy Butler has my all-around game.  He can shoot, pass, defend, rebound.  I can do all of those things too.

Because lebron james is popular while being the most obvious steroid user is professional sports.
"Follow the size of the heads: Barry Bonds, Mark McGuire, Bo Jackson, Brock Lesnar, Shaquille Oneill, Lebron James."
This tells me that LeBron James is pretty much the exact same person as Michael Jordan.
"this machine lol.  ""lebron james and donald trump are talking about""      lebron james and donald trump are talking about each other because trump is trying to get better treatment from the white man and james is too afraid to stand up for himself in his face.  I just get the feeling like donald has been calling and comparing lebron, afro pick and ms. moana, to little black girls for at least a year  This is the main reason he's running for president.  He literally has butthurt over a girl's choice of haircut. I don't see where any of this has anything to do with how"
"**LeBron James came to my bedroom last night** and gave me a special gift, one that will take me to the next level in my dance journey.  He didn't even dance with me.  He just danced with the beat.  A solid twelve of twelve counts.  Never heard of a 12 of 12, huh?  I can tell you one thing: James would do the entire Michael Jackson Thriller dance for me.  Yes, I'm serious.  Yes, he would.  The 12 of 12 counts and all.  I'm serious.  Check out the video below and see how awesome he is at it.  And James is officially my spirit animal now."
"&gt;I think it's this more than anything. I love David Robinson, LeBron James, and the like and there is technically a chance that they're the 1 in a billion chance but the Delts and general insanity of the schedules they play make me think otherwise.  I remember when Dan Majerle got caught doing PEDs and Barkley's defense of him was ""I've seen him naked in the shower!  that's not a steroid body!"""
"Ever think that maybe those other stars don't exercise their voice because they don't want to or like that LeBron is the one everyone looks to for leadership?  You think James Harden cares about anything league related or is he somewhere popping bottles in a club with no mask? If Curry cared he'd use his voice too. I don't think actual NBA players care as much that LeBron is the face of the league and has his opinion weighed so highly as the fans seem to care. If the players wanted to use their voice, they would too. They don't."
Paging Lebron James....
Lebron james who brings fame and finals appearances for only 39 million is the best steal in the whole league in terms of value for money
Lebron james
If you vote for Biden because Lebron James or any celebrity says so - I question your judgement and intelligence.

"Joel Embiid didn't start playing basketball until he was 15  Muggsy Bogues didn't grow past 5'3"" and he averaged 9 APG for 5+ years in Charlotte  Isaiah Thomas is 5'8"" and he received MVP votes in his peak  Allen Iverson is one of the greatest of all time at 5'11""  Don't let these guys tell you what you can or cannot do. You don't have to be as big as Kevin Durant or Lebron James. 'Small' people like Ty Lawson, Brandon Jennings have made it big.  Good luck, looking forward to see you on that court in a few years."
LeBron James
And then enters Lebron James...
"Yeah same. I mean I've been wanting dude to come to the lakers for a minute. Chicago has done stupider things so like it would be nice lol. But yeah he aint lebron james, but my mans can ball and thats all i was saying. Who you root for my dude?"
"Your team was absolute shit for half a decade, but still landed LeBron fucking James simply for being located in Los Angeles.  Don't act like the Lakers are a some well-oiled machine, shit simply gets handed to them without even trying."
"I don't get the hate towards their ownership. I might be out of the loop, but - seeing how his offensive numbers are historic - didn't they tailor their whole team to James Harden? Didn't he get to the dribble the ball every possession, shoot every shot, and have historically high usage rates? Didn't he ask them to trade for Westbrook?  Be honest with yourself and think - what would happen if instead of Harden, this was LeBron? Same Playoff results and all. Everyone would be killing him.  The late, great Kobe Bryant said before that this playstyle will not win a championship and he was, and will continue to be, absolutely right.   You think Harden's game will just magically change when he goes to Brooklyn, just like some expected Russ' game to change when he went to Houston? 8 years of dribble-between the legs-stepback threes are not gonna change all of a sudden. Harden's not suddenly going to become a consistently reliable defender or an off-ball scrambler.  Harden is low-blowing Rockets fans and pulling their championship aspirations right from under their feet, asking to leave because of his own shortcomings. Again, I honestly don't know what ownership did, but Harden deserves more blame here than anyone else."
"This, people forget the details and patterns that began right when Tillman started. He was outspoken and sounded dumb, but I didn’t care much and liked a local season ticket holder being the owner. But he inherited a 65 win team closest to take on the warriors and losing in game 7 where they had a major injury.   That year they also finally had a top tier defense. That’s rare for an mda coached team because they hired an associate head coach to man the defense in Jeff bzdelik. Tillman started the offseason negotiating with him, annoyed he was paying two head coaches. Low balled him into “retirement”(sort of how morey was going to take a year off), only to finally pay him mid season when rockets struggled.  They also had bird rights to ariza. Now many know he wasn’t worth fifteen mill, but it was one year so now future cap issues, just a one year over pay who is also an expiring trade asset. He eventually was traded for Kelly oubre. So in this league you either can be creative with the assets to add talent when your close to the cap, or you replace it with the minimum. We did with the minimum and we traded away james Enis even though he was in our thin rotation for..luxury tax savings. By the way, look up Tillman’s quotes. He says that he has no idea how or why they got under the cap ands it was an accident...they literally accidentally attached a valuable asset in a pick in a trade that saves money but provides no flexibility to spend now or later so it only helps one person...not morey, not coach, not harden, not the fans or city...just tillman , but he didn’t know why or who did it...  But even ariza, he’s not worth it but he has leverage bc you can’t sign anyone else and your so close. Most people pay up like warriors paid iggy, jr Smith with cavs so on. Even one ring is so rare and you can only improve your chances marginally when your already very good. Look back in history, horry Kerr, paxon, fisher...so on about these guys that are role players maybe not worth full contracts, aging but hits a big play. So with ariza you have a locker room vet, champion, 3/d and your most important switch defender who has the ears of both your stars. Let’s say he was worth his contract at the time of 8 million, so over 7 million one year payment you lower your chcances or a title and talent During your rare window...only worth it for one guy, only Tillman benefits and no one else.  Mickey arson made the mistake of waiving mike Miller and that was beginning of Lebron mistrust for them being committed. These guys money are guaranteed. Harden can coast on 25-5-5 like Lebron ans just like up money. They want more and are committed to growing and you want to take advantage ans respect that when you have those rare stars. Houston won’t see talent like that in awhile and Tillman just burned a rebuild for a long, long time.   But hey, five dollars off any participating Landry’s Between 4am-6am on a 500$ purchase."

"Genuinely, he wasn't bad last season. When he wasn't only passing to Julius Randle last season, he was a passable floor general. I liked him during those times. Unfortunately, for about 30% of EVERY SINGLE PASS he made, it was a pass to Julius Randle. For context, Lebron James made \[less than\] &lt;30% of his passes to Anthony Davis. Yes, Payton passed more to Randle than LBJ to Davis.  Julius Randle is Elfrid Payton's best friend. They are butt-buddies."
"Best eastern team in the 2010s without Lebron James. I’ll concede the Lowry point, but he’s an icon to me :)"
We have eaten some of the most bogus tampering fines in living memory. No one disagrees.   The Lakers weren’t really courting Lebron James. We were a horribly run organization. He just wanted to come here.   Name one instance of the Lakers tampering for Lebron as egregious as what the Bucks just did. You can’t. So stop.
"Every team should just sign Lebron James and Anthony Davis, you're right"
"What if you told someone in 2011 that LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose, Kevin Love and Kyle Korver would be on the same team? And they somehow sucked? Or that Derrick Rose and Carmelo would be on the same team and that team also sucked?"

"because he was a part of that Bucks teams success. So it'd be nice if people remembered more of the picture than just Sidney Moncrief who takes all the credit.   &gt;So why put Magic on quicker guards when they had better options available? What does that have to do with Moncrief?   That when Moncrief guarded assignments other than superstar forwards it was because their team had better options available. So as I said before, Moncrief wasn't even the best defender at everything on his own team. And he's certainly not that over Iguodala.   It's not faulty logic, here's the thing - you may rather have Moncrief to defend those players (I'd argue otherwise, but we can at least say it's a discussion). You would NOT want him to guard LeBron, KD b/c its a mismatch. Whereas Iguodala can guard 1-3 without concerns of mismatches. and he you know he can do this because he's actually done so successfully. So Iguodala is the more versatile defender. That is what I'm saying. YOU keep limiting this discussion to single positions, and that makes no sense. I  and how about James Harden. You want Iguodala or Sidney to guard him? Keep in mind Hardens strength and how he uses that to dislodge defenders."
He literally said “I’ll quit basketball to play football”? But also https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/lebron-james-once-considered-playing-for-the-dallas-cowboys-as-jerry-jones-offered-him-a-contract/amp/ you guys are harping a guy for talking about his dreams lol.
lebron james
"Bet everything they post on there is ""Lebron James looking kinda sexy grocery shopping 😍😍"" and ""RUMOR: LEBRON JAMES GREW ANOTHER AB DURING THE OFFSEASON 😍😍""."
I doubt LeBron James gives a flying fuck about Woj. Lol. “Undermining Woj”. Lol FOH.
"You are severely underrating Lebron at his athletic peak. Him not being a “complete” player does not preclude him from being able to win a ship in his early years if he had a great team around him.   He won 61 games with a team that was in the lottery the next year w/o him. He played with an all-star player 1 year in his early cav days.   His losing in the playoffs was never him failing off a performance cliff (James Harden year after year after year), nor was it him getting completely shut down like Giannis has in the last two years.   If LeBron had an all nba player (Middleton) and all star caliber players (Brogdon, Bledsoe, and Lopez), plus shooters, he wins at least one ring between 07-10 or makes multiple finals runs. As a 22 yo he took a lottery team to the finals and lost bc he didn’t have a reliable second option and the Spurs packed the paint and dared him to shoot.   We saw what happened when LeBron has talent around him. If you think LeBron isn’t contending for championships 07-10 with talent around him then I have nothing for you."
"Scottie Pippen, Gary Payton, Michael Jordan, Tony Allen, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Joe Dumars, Bruce Bowen, Dennis Johnson, Sidney Moncrief. That's 10 who were better."
"Mark Cuban, Dan Gilbert, and Lebron James are definitely the owners that complained to Adam Silver about this.  Pat Riley has buried too many bodies to get involved in this shit and is probably actively started tampering with Kawhi Leonard as soon as the news broke of the Bucks trades."
https://www.forbes.com/sites/garyphillips/2019/01/28/nba-investigation-anthony-davis-trade-request-pelicans-tampering-lakers-lebron-james/  Maybe you should've looked harder
"What a fucking joke, I get that the bucks were caught red handed. But let’s be real everyone with a fucking brain knows all of these huge FA’s didn’t just decide immediately into free agency that they wanted to be with their new team. Obviously there’s never blatant tangible evidence of it but if you told someone that tampering wasn’t involved in virtually every situation, you would look like a straight up fucking idiot.   Right now we’re talking about Bogdan Bogdanovic not all-time great and 4 time champion Lebron James. The fact that not an eye was batted at Lebron immediately signing to the lakers, while a Bogdan Bogdanovic S&amp;T being tweeted out by a dude from ESPN sets off all the sirens and a hopeful small market team who fell into a good situation with a superstar is being scrutinized is absolute bullshit through and through."
"So does James Harden and Giannis, but they get rewarded for it.   The amount of free throws LeBron shoots is a joke. He lives around the rim and gets hacked all the time and doesn't get nearly the amount of free throws he deserves for all the contact he draws."
I'm pretty sure EG's list from 2014 was something like:  1. Nikola Jokic 2. Michael Jordan 3. Lebron James. 4. ...
Random team = Lebron James' Cavs
Y’all really gotta work on your material  Woj: Knicks trading Julius Randle and 2024 2nd round pick for LeBron James  /r/nba: LMAOOOOO LOLKNICKS POWER FORWARDS CLASSIC KNICKS LOL  Fuckin cornballs
"Exactly.   Tell the truth, it's likely the answer to why Darius Miles said ""the Cavaliers don't need Lebron James"" in 2002-03, simply because for the players, tanking makes no sense. Your fans are openly rooting for you to lose games, in the hope that if you lose enough games they'll be able to get a new guy to take your job or your spot? ...that kind of would insult any of the current players on the team."
Wow they got Lebron James and Anthony Davis. They are so fucking smart.
&gt;[Serious] what jersey number does LeBron James wear
"I always assumed that LeBron was a variation on *Le Brun* or *Lebrun*, a French surname meaning ""The Brown"".  A bit like if you took James Brown and flipped his name around."
Yeah I am hoping we move him. I like Blake and he is a great player but even Lebron James would struggle to win with this roster we are going to have around him. Time to tank and develop young talent and he doesn’t fit that plan. He’s too good for us to tank with but not good enough to lead a playoff run
"Did you really just make the argument that Giannis is overrated because he needs a point guard on his team...  Just an fyi, Lebron hadnt won anything at age 25 either. Also since when is Lebron freaking James used as the baseline in an argument abou how good a player is"
"This was described differently before.   A player like LeBron James raises the floor of the team greatly.   Players like AD and Giannis raise the ceiling.      Every LeBron James team is guaranteed to succeed.   AD and Giannis can be on piss poor teams and hardly move the needle, but with a great foundation can make a team insane."
"You not realize Jordan had a HOF coach, two of the best DEFENDERS in that era? Who was the toughest opponent to MJ in the finals? The old Lakers team? Lebron faced tougher competition in his finals and didn’t have near as much help as Jordan did. Yeah he had some stars to compliment him, but so did Jordan. So did a LOT of fucking people in the league. Also if they were to 1v1 in their prime Im taking the bigger, stronger, and more athletic player in LeBron James. So imo yes Bron is better than Jordan"
Lol people always skip over 2010 when LeBron was FIRST SEED 61-wins MVP and got butt stomped so hard by the 4th seed he had to change jerseys then went on to choke in the.  NBA Finals the next year.  Yeah thats the GOAT. LeGOAT James.  1st seed.  MVP bounced out never happened to jordan
"I think they'll be competitive.   But it is very possible it is over.   Steph is in his 30s.   Klay is in his 30s.  Dray is in his 30s.  I think what we failed to realize is that they won their Championships when they were in the prime mid to late 20s years of age.   Guys like LeBron, Kobe, Nash, etc. who ball out in their early to mid 30s aren't the norm. Especially LeBron who is arguably the 1b to Jordans 1a or second best player of all time to MJ #1 at worst.   When Steph, Klay, and Dray are back completely next year I expect them to be very competitive especially including the fact that they got the #2 player in the NBA draft this year. So they ought to be really good in 2021-22 season and maybe a final big contender in 2022-23 season. Unless James Wiseman becomes an absolute baller and Andrew Wiggins finally figures shit out. In that case I expect the dynasty to continue"
That's how desperate people are to denigrate LeBron James. It's just sad to watch them reach that level
No!!! Every top pick must be Lebron James not matter the circumstance! Anything less and he’s a bust who should be out of the league :)

"Ignoring my thoughts of Bill Simmons as a draft analyst (if that's what you were saying), he obviously ""passed the eye test"" to many people.  Was an All-American and led his team to a FF through a broken wrist.  Defensive POY.  There was slight wavering before the draft because KD was obviously an elite prospect as well ([NBAdraft.net](https://NBAdraft.net) said about him, ""In any draft sans LeBron James and Greg Oden of the past 10 years, he is the consensus top pick""), but basically from the time he was 15-16 to the day he was drafted, Oden was the near-consensus #1 pick in that draft.  &amp;#x200B;  [NBADraft.net](https://NBADraft.net) had his comparison as 'David Robinson/Bill Russell', and not a word of injury concerns in any of their scouting pre-draft.  In fact, far from saying ""he walks like an old man"", they gave him a 10/10 athleticism rating.  From what I saw of him, it was deserved - the guy was ridiculous.  &amp;#x200B;  FWIW, he probably DID walk like an old man at 20 .. because he'd already suffered a serious knee injury and had microfracture surgery since he'd been drafted.    &amp;#x200B;  It's definitely hard for me to imagine someone watching this guy play:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp\_koHAf2Rg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp_koHAf2Rg)  and saying ""he moves like an old man"".  He moved like very, very few guys his size have ever moved.  The only big guy I can think of since him that was a similar level prospect is Davis."

Why cant russ run the floor lol. Also im not saying u said it. Im just saying if lebron james is the only thing keeping the rockets back from a championship. The rockets should run it back. They had the tools. Also if the knicks could get wb with that trade. It would have happened already lol.
"LeBron James is listed as your point guard because he wants to be. He’s playing literally the exact same role he’s been playing for as long as I can remember. Was he a point guard in Cleveland even though he was listed at small forward? That’s the argument you’re making with Giannis, because he has a much higher usage rate than Eric Bledsoe, averages more assists than Eric Bledsoe, and is the primary ball handler in Milwaukee. The only difference between Avery Bradley and Bledsoe is that one gets to call himself a point guard and the other doesn’t.  You are way too attached to positional titles. That shit is meaningless. The shooting guard position is basically extinct. Traditional power forwards are basically extinct. Paul George, who you insist is a shooting guard, slides up to play the fucking four for the Clippers! If you’re still describing players using terms like “shooting guard” and “power forward” then you’re the one who doesn’t know what the fuck they’re talking about. There are smalls, wings, and bigs. That’s it. Teams plug them into the outdated positional spectrum and idiots like you argue about how players fit into it like trying hammer a square peg into a round hole."
Didn't he take a couple weeks off from the Cavs just because he felt like it once? Edit: https://www.businessinsider.com/why-lebron-james-took-the-break-2015-10
"Lebron, Lebron.  Shout out to James Harden as a floor raiser though."
"Bold prediction, HOT TAKE 5. Dragan Bender, Yes I still belive in this guy. 4. Lebron James, unreal ironman 3. Tatum 2. Doncic 1. Lamelo"
"If you want a better job, and in Harden's case, why sign the contract?  Sign shorter deals like Durant did.  Jordan did the same.  As did Lebron James.  So it's fair to want the contract and the ability to move?"
Lebron james will still somehow be top 5
"Lol I think he is still gonna be poison, but I think his rational is that he actually really gets along with KD unlike LeBron where they weren't necessarily friends. As for James Harden idk about their relationship but I think that Harden gets a little bit of unfair reputation sometimes. He's not as much of a ball hog or non team player as he just a ball stopper. It's obviously not gonna work there unless Harden is the primary guy, but I don't think he has a problem with other guys getting involved, his play style just isn't good at doing that."
"If people like Lebron James and Jeff Bezos have hair issues, that really shows there is no cure for baldness that money can buy today."
1. Obi Toppin 2. Luka Donchich 3. Giannis Atekumpo 4. LeBron James 5. CJ McCollum
This is totally true.  Genetics also plays a definite role as I think Klay Thompson is also a very serious player.  But not everyone is fortunate enough to have the body of LeBron James.
"Well, how do you take this out of canon after NBA scripted their latest twist and turn of ""Lebron James wins the NBA Title for Kobe, going through his former team led by the son of MJ in an attempt to finally take the GOAT throne?"""
"\&gt;Tatum isn't even close to being good enough to lead his team past any championship team in the last 5 years  I just want to point out how your list is hypocritical by your own logic:  James Harden - has never beaten a championship contender and almost lost to OKC.   Embiid - got swept by Tatum. Not sure how he can be someone who can lead his team past any championship team (and in your eyes better than Tatum)  when he can't even lead his team to win one game against Tatum.   KD - Dude has never won a game against a championship contender without Steph Curry.   Giannis - Lost to Jimmy Butler just like Tatum, still hasn't sniffed the Finals  AD - Couldn't sniff past the first round (and really the playoffs most years) before Bron.  Dame - Beat OKC last year and...nothing else really  Luka - Pops of the screen but if we're going off...leading your team past xxx. Hasn't done it.   Kyrie - his hardware is non-existent post lebron  Beal - is a joke compared to everyone else on this list. Can't even make the playoffs!   Booker - worse record than Beal, with more team talent.   KAT - such a baby on the floor that Jimmy had to gtfo   I want to point out that by your own criteria, almost nobody on your list has the ability to move past a championship contender."
"He also averaged 12 ppg on 34% shooting in 5 games to get eliminated by the Bucks. And no, he's been in two ECFs. One against the 5th seed Heat, the other against Lebron James. Like literally it was Lebron vs the Celtics and the Celtics went 2-0 up and Kevin Love was injured later in the series   What about Tatum's individual performance this year or any year has personally shown to you he can lead a team to a title?"
"Do I really have to go Barney style on you?   Here let me dumb it down as much as possible. A player who is as skilled as George is can play multiple positions. Therefore he can slot into multiple positions with ease. Just because he slots in as Guard or a Forward doesn’t mean he’s designated as that position. George is a prime example of someone who can be labeled as a G/F player. Take Kobe for example, He’s a Shooting Guard but if you watched the Lakers play you would have known he was our de facto point guard for most of his career. Take LeBron James as another example, he’s a Forward but he has played as the teams de facto point guard for most of his career. Does that mean he’s a PG? No it means he can play multiple positions and fill in at multiple positions. It’s how the modern NBA works.   You calling Paul George an elite 3-D player is an insult. Even if you added he had an elite off the dribble game. It shows that you don’t know how he plays. And even more it shows you don’t know what an elite 3-D player is. A 3-D player is someone whose main purpose is to shoot 3’s and defend. Paul George does waaaaay more than that. He facilitates, he cuts, he penetrates, he ISO’s, he can post up. You have no idea what you’re talking about and it shows.  [And ESPN has him labeled as the teams SG](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george). You just keep on being wrong lmao"
Lebron James
"LeBron actually has said he got serious about his body when he was 24 - I remember because he inadvertently shaded McDonalds which was one of his endorsements at the time:  https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2015/02/25/say-what-lebron-disses-his-sponsor-mcdonalds.html   &gt; Someone asked how old he was when he starting being serious about weight lifting.  &gt; ""Umm, 24. I ate McDonald's my first couple years in the NBA,"" he said. ""I didn't stretch. It didn't matter. I was 18, and I could do whatever I wanted to.""  &gt; Later he rebounded from the gaffe, mentioning how much he continues to eat at the Golden Arches.  &gt; ""Every day. Every day. Every day,"" James said. ""I had it this morning. Egg and sausage McMuffin. All day."""
Damian Lillard shot 35% from the floor in a 4 game sweep in 2018  Lebron James shot 36/20/69 in a 4 game sweep in 2007   Just a couple examples and Tobias Harris isn’t as good as those players (obviously) but yes good players do shoot poorly when facing superior competition sometimes.
"My favorite time meeting an NBA player unexpectedly was at my local LifeTime Fitness. Me and my friends were in 8th grade hanging out in the LifeTimeCafe and some guy comes in with Warriors shorts on. I wanted to ask him about Monta Ellis, “I said do you know Monta Ellis”? I was thinking we were just going to have a general conversation about a player.  And he said, “Yes, I’m his trainer, he’s right outside the Cafe”. I was like no way, I run out and sure enough there is Monta Ellis. It was like seeing LeBron James, I was so excited. Keep in mind, this was in a suburb of Memphis Tennessee so it was pretty random that he would actually be there. The Warriors trainer was so cool, he gave me his phone number and later shipped me an autograph picture of Monta Ellis and made the autograph out to me. I will forever be thankful. I’ll try to find the photo I took that day  edit* heres the picture  https://imgur.com/a/H9qI37h"
"Are Knicks fans really not concerned that every decision Leon Rose has made is to hire and boost CAA(his agency) and its clients?  [https://theknickswall.com/lets-keep-tabs-this-leon-rose-caa-thing-knicks/](https://theknickswall.com/lets-keep-tabs-this-leon-rose-caa-thing-knicks/)  And Obi Toppin is CAA.  I'd be concerned.

"I feel like teams which want a good player like okc wanted Paul George are trying to win and they don't mind losing 5 first round picks since their value will be low if they get pg anyway. This might not be the same in nfl but in the nba teams which want to win right now trade for a big player even if they lose some draft picks. Even if they get a high draft pick, it takes time and the right coaching/culture to develop a rookie. The draft is a risk for many teams since you can't tell which player is a LeBron James or a bust."
"We once traded Otis Thorpe in 1997 that ended up being a top 3 pick in 2003 that had a draft including Lebron James, Carmello Anthony, Chris Bosh, and Dwayne Wade. That worked out great for us!"
"lebron ""lebron james"" james"
"You know who else was a solid defensive big man in college? Willie Cauley Stein   https://www.nba.com/celtics/draft/profile-willie-cauley-stein  “Willie Cauley-Stein is a freak athlete. Not in the same sense as a guy like LeBron James, but for other reasons. He’s a legit 7-footer on the court who moves as gracefully as a guard. In fact, he’s actually capable of out-running many guards in transition. Cauley-Stein is a guy who can make a difference at the defensive end of the court right now.”"
LeBron James only has one first name.
"&gt;When is that ever not expected to be a cornerstone for a team in any sport?   When the team already has a cornerstone.  Fultz was drafted to be a 3rd option, as Philly already had Simmons and Embiid as their cornerstones.  Wiggins was drafted #1 when the Cavs already had Kyrie as the cornerstone at the time (before LeBron returned).  If the Magic hadn't been able to work a trade of Webber to GS, they would've drafted Penny #1 to be a 2nd option to Shaq.  The Lakers drafted James Worthy #1 when they already had Magic and Kareem.  The Rockets drafted Hakeem #1 when they already had Ralph Sampson, the #1 pick the year before.  The Blazers drafted Mychal Thompson (Klay's dad) #1 when they had Bill Walton, the reigning MVP."
Here's Tristan Thompson talking about it https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2876113-tristan-thompson-lebron-james-has-worst-f-king-diet-ever-eats-like-s-t
"Well simple answer is his combination (or lack thereof) of size (6’1) and age (22) which when you’re putting together an NBA draft board are big factors. The kid can ball. And he’s proven it, many times. He averaged 18+ the last couple years while taking the assist record. But you have to keep in mind that NBA teams are taking kids who have never played in the big leagues, ever. And it’s hard to go from playing against college kids to playing against Kevin Durant and Lebron James. So, they have certain metrics they base their picks on. Its hard to go off the typical eye test when you get two picks a year, which is why he fell. I think he’s going to succeed based on what I’ve seen from him on tape, but it’s a tough league to make it in."
"&gt;It suggest he’s missing that drive / hunger that makes players like Kobe and Lebron who they are.   ""I love the sport (of football) more than basketball."" -LeBron James, to ESPN's Heather Cox, during the 2013 Ohio State-Wisconsin game  https://twitter.com/KNegandhiESPN/status/384121071047557120?s=09  Surely LeBron liking another sport more has hampered his drive to be great at the sport that's his job. What a failure by the Lakers to overlook that HUGE RED FLAG!"
Someone grab Skip Bayless and ensure that he doesn't go on his show tomorrow. Knowing him he probably will spin around after his Dak Prescott fiasco and start screaming how Lebron James is to blame for this.
LeBron James? Dwyane Wade? Norris Cole? You must've had some serious trust issues with the Heatles.
with the Next Pick Lebron James selects **James Harden**  but you can't do that LeBron  Fuck you  - LeBron
"He’s a physical specimen. I’m not saying he’s LeBron James, but he has a similar physical mold. 6’9, thick, and can jump out of the gym. Couple that with a good shooting touch and impressive work ethic it shows a ton of untapped potential."
That current player? Lebron Raymone James Sr.
"The year is 2040.  LeBron James has just completed his 36th trip to the Finals in the last 37 years, averaging a 25/8/7 during the regular season.  A single tear drops down his face as he watches his son Bronny announce his retirement after 17 years in the NBA.  Then he goes into he cryochamber to prepare for next season."
Lebron James?
And won't be another till Lebron James Jr. is drafted.
“There’s no lebron James in this draft.”    What a take.
There hasn't been a LeBron James in any draft since LeBron James.
"""there's no lebron james in this class"" - bold take there"
There hasnt been a Lebron James draft since 2003.
No Lebron James in this class? Wtf jay
"The way I took his comment is that this is not apples to apples to something like Davis' trade request. The Rockets have been competing the whole time, they've met every single need of James Harden. The reason they're in this spot is James Harden. Now he's bending them over to trade him for pennies on the dollar. Wouldn't their lack of championship success somewhat fall on James Harden? He's their star player and he's been given everything he's asked for.   I do agree, the Rockets have done right by Harden for the most part. Their failures come down to bad luck and James not coming through for them in the playoffs. Obviously I'm not saying they should have won every championship, but they should have made a Finals by now. In most other situations you can look at the front office failing the player: LeBron in Cleveland, Davis in New Orleans, etc. If they trade Harden, they've met every need of his and will be left with nothing.   Or...I'm misunderstanding his quote? Which could be possible!"
Do you know who James harden is  All those future firsts will be in 25-30 range  The only duo on the level of Steph curry and James harden is lebron and ad
"Lebron James, then James Harden, then Kawhi Leonard"
"He's gonna draft Emoni Bates, and Bronny James just to make LeBron the veteran presence on a minimum deal in 2025 lol"
*LeBron James has entered the chat*
"Draft rights to Lebron James, Jr. coming right up!"
Not if you are LeBron fucking James
"Okay. One LeBron James, please."
"Want to see ""the copypasta"" live:  &gt;Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!” Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, “We got an \[expletive\] squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
KD definitely doesn’t have the same power as LeBron. Brons just on a different level.   Also not sure if LeBron came up with the nickname “King James” the way KD tried to call himself the servant.
The Airplane ride with Dan Gilbert and LeBron James.  Mostly the cavs lockerroom to see the dysfunction that went on during the playoff years

It's amazing the pressure LeBron James has had on his shoulders since he was a youngster.  But even more incredible is to see that he has managed to handle that pressure and meet all the expectations by becoming the greatest player of all time.  GOAT.
"https://www.nba.com/lakers/news/180729lebron-james-first-words-lakers  &gt; Pelinka and Magic Johnson were able to give some insight into LeBron’s way of thinking based on their conversations with him in early July. They noted that he really liked L.A.’s young players and cap situation moving forward in addition to his connecting with Magic and respecting the franchise’s legacy. A few weeks later, on Sunday afternoon via his Uninterrupted platform, LeBron made his first public comments about his imminent donning of purple and gold. &gt;  &gt; “You look at the Lakers,” he said. “Being able to play for a historic franchise with so much history, and now being able to partner with Magic Johnson, someone I kinda like looked up to when I was younger and wanted to make no look passes like Magic, wanted to get on the break and be Showtime like Magic and then for it to all come to fruition at this point... &gt;  &gt; “I think timing is everything. For me to be in this position now, the excitement that I have to be a Laker, I’m happy to be apart of it because I believe the Lakers is a historical franchise, we all know that, but it’s a championship franchise and that’s what we’re trying to get back to. I’m happy to be a part of the culture and be a part of us getting back to that point.”  If it's so easy to leverage a franchise's past success to sign superstars and win championships with them, you'd think the Bulls and Celtics would have have had much more success in the past 20 years. And yet..."
"I wonder if these comments comparing Zion, Simmons, Wiggins, or other number one picks actually remember what it was like when Lebron James was in high school.  None of these players had the same level of hype as Lebron.  He signed a $90 million contract before ever playing a single game, he was on the cover of SI back when SI was a big deal with the headline 'The Chosen One, and his games were televised nationally with ratings as high as NBA games.  There may be an equivalency in another sport but I honestly can't think of a comparison.  Costas was absolutely right about the expectations of Lebron James and nothing he stated was anything Lebron didn't already know about what was expected of him coming into the league."
"Costas: ""LeBron James, how does it feel to know that if you are not a Hall of Fame caliber player, it's not good enough to be good or to be an All-Star, if you're not eventually a first rank Hall of Famer a lot of people will say you were a bust or overhyped?""  LeBron: ""How does that make me feel? Well I don't look at it as going into the future, I always look at it by... I take every moment at a time, because you're not promised tomorrow, and that's what my mom brought me up on. I just try to get better every day at what I do."""

Yeah well that's why he's LeBron James now. It costs to be the boss.
"Every year, the media try to drive a new narrative on who’s better than LeBron. Come playoffs, we know who the true MVP is.  Butler said it best...to win a championship, you need to go through a LeBron James led team. These nephews with their recency bias don’t know sh$t. He’s been balling in the league for 17 years. Where was your favourite then"
"Maybe you’re right. Someone whose on the court talent could surpass him may come along. I don’t see it being a transcendent, franchise-altering player, with the off the court image of James. Personally I would enjoy it. I love the game and would consider myself lucky to see another lebron. I just don’t believe it will happen before I leave this mortal plane."
"I just turned 40. I don’t believe there is any chance I will see another talent like lebron in the nba during my lifetime. Maybe not in all of professional sports. He invigorated the league similar to Tiger and the PGA. Of course Woods fell apart and, for the most part, put himself back together. Lebron has been under the microscope for 20 plus years and hasn’t cracked. He’s elevated teammates as much as Manning and Brady elevated no name WR’s during their prime. He has willed nearly every team he’s had to the finals. He is a force of nature. And of course he made us all believe kyrie was more than a flat earther with sick handles. 2 stops later and we see the truth. He needed James to be the guy, he wasn’t/isn’t ready to shoulder the load. LBJ is a national fucking treasure and anyone who considers themselves a fan on the game should be thankful to be alive to witness."
"People act like we controlled wherever Hayward could go. Hayward wanted the bag, he got the bag. The pacers could have offered LeBron James, but if the hornets offered more money, Hayward would gone there anyway."
1st and last interview by Bob Costas with Lebron James lol
"He ranks 121st in the NBA in PER. LeBron James ranks 7th. TJ Warren ranks 55th, Brogdon 62nd, Sabonis 32nd. Seems fairly accurate."
"I think I can comment here as a very casual basketball fan. Lebron James was hyped like no one else I’ve ever heard of in the sport. I kept hearing about how LBJ was going to enter the league and dominate like nobody in a generation. I’ve never heard of Parker. That’s the difference. When people who barely pay attention to a sport know about a player before he even starts playing, that is the ultimate hype."
"You cant just assert that davis takes tougher shots, because no stats back this up. From the eye test too, davis has lebron fucking james and playoff rondo setting him up for easy shots - literally lebron's bets attribute is creating easy shots for his teammates. Jokic leads the league in so many tough shot indicators such as FG% with less that 5 seconds left on the shot clock. And shot a higher % than davis on both ""very tight"" and ""tight"" contested shots. From the eye test, Jokic has build his game on making tough, unorthodox shots. Have you not seen Jokic's signature sombor shuffle or is that just not a ""tough shot""? I dont know how you can assert that Davis takes tougher shots than Jokic, when pretty much whatever restrictions you run to account for Davis having ""tough shots"" Jokic still has a higher %."
"Imagine decades or even a century from now, the James lineage has been established as tycoons and LeBron being a basketball player will just be a fun fact about the founder of the family business when people read about him lol"
"There are two components to this equation.  One is character - how hard you'll work, what kind of team mate you are, how well you'll accept sacrifice for the good of the team, etc.  The other is intelligence. The difference between a great prospect who becomes a superstar, vs a great prospect who becomes a bust, often comes down to intelligence.  A guy like Wiggins is a great example. Based on his early skills and athletic ability, he looked like perhaps the next Lebron James kind of player. But his work ethic is up and down, and his IQ is low."
"For me this is why he is the greatest. You can argue stats and championships all day, but no one has delivered more on the hype than LeBron James. He’s been great every single year for almost two decades."
"Davis if your team has lebron James, Jokic on pretty much any team that doesnt have lebron james (or a similarly transcendent shotmaker/playmaker e.g steph)."
Fun fact - I have as many HOF votes as Lebron James
Nephews here did not have an idea on the gatekeeping for Kobe back in mid to late 2000s. That only ended when LBJ won back to back with Heat.    You aint a nephew if you remember the **King Crab (dribble)** jokes and its disparaging comparison to Black Mamba.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/107452-lebron-james-crab-dribbling-his-way-to-failure   imagine some small time bleacher report writer trying to write with that tone on LeBron these days.... That writer would be a clown.
Love it when my 25 year old 78 overall small forward throws a fit because he feels he deserves to start over lebron james lol
&gt;Butler literally had two of the best games in Finals history while guarding LeBron James on the other end.   Lol at claiming Butler guarded LeBron for more than a few possessions here &amp; there
The funny thing about LeBron James is that he lived perfectly up to the hype. And boy was he hyped up.
I dunno. Still not totally sure if Lebron James is a hall of famer 😏
"""just look at 2 of the best slashers in the league, including lebron james in his absolute prime. look how easily he gets to the rim"""
"His draft profile on [nbadraft.net](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/lebron-james/) mentions just that. Compared him to Magic, and said that he'd be a top-5 passer in the NBA day 1 that can play multiple positions.   And his weaknesses were basically: can he live to the hype, and also sometimes he goes for the flashy play and not the safe one.   I had just turned 9 when he was drafted so I didn't really pay much attention. But I've heard the hype was unheard of"
https://vault.si.com/vault/2002/02/18/ahead-of-his-class-ohio-high-school-junior-lebron-james-is-so-good-that-hes-already-being-mentioned-as-the-heir-to-air-jordan
The only reason these are not completely assholish questions is that the person being asked is LeBron James who has already lived up to the legend of his potential and is still adding to it as the current champion and Finals MVP. He fucking trucked everyone and everything. Got it done. That quiet self confidence he answers that tomorrow is not promised - That is a withered 45+ year olds response and he appears to truly believe it. I wish I knew him personally man.
Lebron James.
"Sheer volume ofc is not the bar.  That said, being able to do something twice as long as others is definitely noteworthy (see LeBron James).  And besides, he tried to kill people every time he dunked!    With that volume, he's going to have a mile-long highlight reel, which he does, which may also work against him, as in, even though it ALL looks impressive, it takes away from the impact it leaves on you."
"I was old enough. LeBron was ridiculously hyped by the time he was a sophomore. And remember this is an era before social media made “going viral” an every day occurrence. The high school had to change gyms to a 5,000 person stadium to hold the crowds that came to watch him. There’s never been anyone that’s come close to his hype, in an age where video circulation is easier than its ever been. James was billed as a future GOAT. And he’s come close to delivering on that."
"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but these opinions are just hilarious.  ""There is nothing that I can say I dislike about Lebron James. Not only do I recognize his greatness and good will, I respect him for it. That being said, I do not like Lebron James""  It's like how politicians use opposite points in a single statement to play both sides."
"His [NBAdraft.net](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/lebron-james/) profile nailed him perfectly, especially his ""weaknesses."" &gt; Weaknesses: All the hype at such a young age is inconceivable. Can he stay focused and continue to work hard to improve his game? His free throw shooting must improve. Defensive intensity must get better. Right now, he’s under 70%, but this should definitely improve with experience. LeBron still tends to go for the spectacular at times when a solid play is all that’s necessary. But it’s probably nitpicking as he likes to put on a show, and usually only brings out tricks when the game is in hand. Which for him on the HS level is usually the entire game. No one has ever had to overcome this kind of hype as a highschool player."
"If we ever see a player that had the same amount of hype as Lebron did, I doubt they would meet or exceed expectations.  If we ever see a physical freak like Lebron is, as great as whoever it is, i doubt they would have 10 finals appearances with 9 in a decade.  If we ever see someone who has as many final appearances as Lebron, consecutively or not, he’d probably be a james jones type player instead of somebody like Lebron"
"Oh woe is you, a laker fan not getting visits from a few superstars.  Lmfao my dude you have fucking LEBRON JAMES on your team.  Imagine that. Feeling sorry for your team because you had a 10 year period where you couldn't attract all-star players to your franchise because of the location alone."
"&gt;So your argument is that Curry made the NBA Finals twice in the tougher Western Conference, but because he didn't reach the standards of the second best player of all time that minimizes his legacy? Because that's what you are arguing here and nowhere did I say that Curry was better than Lebron.  No idea what youre talking about.  My argument was the warriors play injured teams all the time, especially the 2015 Cavs team that was all time injured.  &gt;Dray's suspension did change that series. It's no excuse, but it happened.  He had two more games after his deserved suspension for touching dicks.  Maybe Mr. unanimous gravity should have done something about that.  &gt;And that first series may have gone 6 games, but it wasn't close.  Maybe having your second option not be Matthew fucking dellavadova would have made it close, you think?  Again, Lebron took it 6 games with Delly and James Jones.  Give him ONE of Kyire and Lebron and its a 5 game series.  Give him both and it might be a sweep."
Dirk - didn't face a team that had Prime KD prime Steph Prime Klay with a former DPOY which is considered the team that broke the NBA for a few seasons.   Lebron - literally got gentleman swept by the KD warriors with a fully healthy Cavs then actually got swept the next year (albeit with a bad team).  The raptors - rings a ring but come on look at the Warriors team they faced last year and seriously tell me the outcome if they play a fully healthy warriors.  2016 Cavs - Lebron led and had an insane comeback against a warriors squad that did not have Prime KD (and still were a game away from losing)   You don't have to be the clear cut favorite but you do need other stuff to go your way to win which &amp; maybe even some luck - none of which James has had.   Also look up the 2015 rockets and your gonna laugh at the roster that made it to the WCF. 2016 was a shit show we just don't talk about. 2017 it was Harden alone. 2018 they were close then cp3 goes down (badluck). 2019 Harden is dropping buckets on the KD warriors only for his co star to shit the bed for 5/6 games. 2020 they face a Lebron/AD led team that ends up winning it all (again they were not favored here at all)
"Kyrie had LeBron fucking James are you kidding me??  Butler literally had two of the best games in Finals history while guarding LeBron James on the other end. Tatum isn't doing that. Embiid can't match that impact. Jimmy is an elite floor general, and impacts winning just as much as Damian Lillard."
"Don’t forget he was also super good football player in high school, just an ultimate athlete  &gt;	The fact that James’ future was in basketball was not known around Notre Dame yet, despite it being known around Ohio, according to Bleacher Report. Because of this, Meyer recruited James during his sophomore season. However, Meyer was laughed at by James’ coach, according to Bleacher Report.  &gt;	“I didn’t know what he was laughing at, so we went down and sat in a room and he said, ‘Do you know who that is?’ and I said, ‘No’ and he said, ‘LeBron James’ and I said, ‘Who’s LeBron James?’ and he said, ‘He’ll be the next Michael Jordan.’ And I go, ‘Come on,’” Meyer said in 2012, according to Bleacher Report.   https://www.sportscasting.com/lebron-james-was-once-recruited-to-play-football-for-a-legendary-college-coach/"
"No doubt.    I have to be real: I don’t like LeBron James, at all.  But you cannot deny that he’s a basketball genius and really does try to do the right thing.  He’s actively trying to be a good person.  I will always respect that."
Takes money to make money. Lebron is obviously not the type to overspend or be dumb with his money. I’m sure he has been investing huge chunks of his earnings into low risk mutual funds and shit like that. His investments will be returning millions upon millions for the rest of the James family lineage.
"Crazy how Lebron James was being called the next Jordan, at 15 and completely lived up to the hype.  A living legend who doesn’t get his flowers enough, everyone tries to focus on everything he’s not instead of appreciating who he is."
"Top 2 player in the league only challenged/2nd to prime LeBron James, a top 10 player, another top 20 guy, a top ~25 player, *and* Iggy and Livingston... Easily the GOAT team."
"Magic Johnson, who was dare i say, Magic.  Magic was LeBron James before LeBron James, but Magic was more charismatic and played in L.A for his entire career and not in Cleveland. LeBron is more physically gifted and a better defender than Magic was, but for how good as passer that LeBron is, he can't shine Magic's shoes.  Magic was insanely hyped too, dude had the nickname in college and his matchup against Bird was the most watched game in college basketball history.  People underrate Magic these days and forget that in a 12 year span the guy went to 9 Finals, won 5 with 3 Finals MVPs and was a 3-time league MVP, only God knows what his accomplishments would've looked like if he didn't get HIV."
Lebron James.
"If that's the line your drawing then he didn't meet his expectations, as he never truly got NBA ratings to the same place they were when Michael left.  The whole point of this excerpt lies in the fact that Kobe and Shaq shared the spotlight, they were absolutely two guys that could've filled Jordan's space, but simply by being together they diminished each other.  Nobody will live up to what MJ did in terms of ratings and how famous he was, people that never watched a basketball game in their lives knew who Michael Jordan was and Game 6 of the 1998 Finals stands as the most watched basketball game ever by a mile and that series averaged 29 millions viewers, no series since went over 20 million.  LeBron's expectations were to revive the league and be a Hall of Famer. He exceeded the HoF expectations, but as an icon that drew more viewers to the league? No, he didn't get close to Michael and not even Magic tbh. People forget that in both series in which the NBA Finals had it's worst ratings, LeBron James was involved, that would've never happened to MJ or to Magic, people watched just to see them play regardless of what was going on.  Not that it matters by the way, Magic and Bird both drew more attention to the league than LeBron, but most consider LeBron better than both."
Your sources are terrible. Klove averaged volume stats on a garbage team. Ohio as a state is one of the poorest states in the country. Over half of kyries points were actually created by lebron if you look at advanced metrics. And https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23769496/lebron-james-worth-millions-economy-cleveland
"To be fair, that finals MVP wasnt against Lebron James and he wasn’t part of the greatest team ever"
"i dont know how u cant consider that to be his expectations lol  nba ratings plummeted after jordan retired with the bulls. they needed a new GOAT to step up and bring the ratings back up and they were searching for him.   in case you dont believe me, here's an excerpt from a book written in 2003:  &gt;The pressure on James is immense. You see, the simple fact of the matter is that no one has ever entered the NBA with as much buildup as this young man from Akron, Ohio. Not only is he physically gifted, in terms of basketball ability, but he also possesses a mix of charm and toughness at the same time — a star quality that must be natural to pass muster with fans. Equally important, he joins the professional ranks at a time when the league itself is searching for a post-Jordan identity. If David Stern and his minions have learned anything from MJ’s several retirements it is that without him the NBA just isn’t the same — attendance declines, ratings fall, and merchandise sales plummet.  &gt;Now that Jordan is retiring for good, the NBA needs a new talent that can get people energized about the pro game. For all their greatness, players such as Kobe, Shaq, McGrady, and Iverson simply don’t resonate with the general public that tuned in to Bulls and Wizards games, whether they considered themselves fans or not, then bought the products Jordan plugged. The NBA needs LeBron James to live up to the hype and the hope. The future does not necessarily hang in the balance, but finding another Jordan to showcase could revitalize the game for another generation.  this dude was just drafted out of high school and they're writing about how they need him to be michael jordan 2.0 to save the league's ratings."
"No one in the history of sports has had the pressure and expectations coming out of high school as LeBron James. And not only did he meet those expectations, he’s exceeded them and has become the greatest player of all time."
A young Lebron James that can’t shoot. So which player is that actually?
[Yes he did. ](https://theundefeated.com/features/rememberwhensday-lebron-james-puts-derrick-rose-in-the-torture-chamber/)
"Ben Simmons has an extremely high ceiling, is that ceiling equal to Lebron James? I doubt it. Is Ben Simmons still going to be a superstar in the league for a long time? I don’t doubt that."
"I don’t think you have a good concept of the numbers we are talking about relative to society. Nor do I think you have an understanding on the global society. A person, alone, cannot be worth billions more than another person. They just simply don’t do enough. They are reliant on too many people. Who on earth can act like their success isn’t due to millions of others? Who can claim they are the sole reason for their prosperity?   Again, being in the right place at the right time with the right skill does not entitle you to billions more than others. Even LeBron James and Michael Jordan strictly in talent in the game of basketball, do not out earn their peers by 1000000x the value. Think about that. Think about global soccer, where there is no cap. Messi doesn’t earn 1000000x than his teammates because even he isn’t that much MORE valuable ... there’s simply nothing one human does that’s 1000x or 10000x or 1000000x times more valuable."
5 might be tough but he get 4 years if he wants one. It's Lebron James even if he is no longer the best player he would still be box office for the next 4 years.

"Sigh. Lebron stans are ridiculous   H Nothing you said actually convinced me it wasn't very similar to Cleveland both love and Kyrie had been in the league for several years and not had individual success.   They were in their prime of their career and absolutely had individual success.   &gt; The economy of Cleveland was directly and strongly influenced by lebron James.   LOLLLLLLLLL in what way? Please source me  &gt; Lebron led in every statistical category the year they won the championship and carried them to the finals even when kyrie and love were hurt and dellevedova was his 2nd best player.   In 2016, Kyrie had one of the best second option final series you could possible have.. especially when they won their 3 final games. Irving was even more efficient that James.   In 2015 playoffs, Kyrie was playing for much of that stretch   Lebron anchored a horrendous offense without Kyrie and Love in the finals. Cavs was holding on with their defense..... unless you think Lebron was the reason their defense was elite.   Delly shut down Curry for multiple games and Mozgov was actually their second best player  &gt; Lebron absolutely lifted his city with his team on his back. Cleveland is also incredibly poor with high rates of violence.  This is some of the stupidest shit I’ve read.   Don’t compare modern day America in a developed urban city such as Celeveland and compare it to 1980’s Naples in Italy"
Yeah LeBron James JR aka Bronny.

"I dont think I shifted anything? My argument has never been that Ben Taylor was under qualified in giving these ratings. My thing is that since is he is using an eye test, why should only his opinion of what good pass matter. Especially when there are coaches/gms and players in the league much more qualified to make these ratings.  The very first example your brought up was Vlad Divac man. Why would you assume Im talking about the dumbest  players or coaches in the NBA?  Or even median level minds? Like yes, Im sorry, there are people in the league that are really good at what they do. And just because you have a Vlade Divac or Knicks, doesnt mean Taylor's eye tests is gonna be better than dude's who have tons of experience in the NBA. How  about Stan Van Gundy? Is Taylor's eye test better than his? Like Tom Thibeadu? Is Taylor's eye test better than his? or Nick Nurse? Or Brad Stevens? or Kerr or Spolstera? Or Dantoni?  These are dude's who watch a ton of film for a living man. There is no reason to believe Taylor's eye tests is better than those guys.   Idk, it depends on the player/coach/or /GM? / These guys also spend a lot of time looking at film as well. And more than likely if you sat these guys down and had them look and rate as many passes as Taylor did, they could probably add more perspective which is what I've been saying.   Why would I think Ben Taylor's eye test would be better than more than 50% of the NBA sphere.? Is that logical?  Some players and coaches/GMs just have a better eye for evaluating things on the court. And that's why they are in the NBA the NBA to begin with.    At this point, Im feeling like I should have said above average player with higher bball IQ(I kind of feel like it should have been self explanatory). Like I feel like those players are more qualified than Taylor to rank these passes. Chris Paul, Lebron, James Harden, Luka etc.   &gt;I’ve reviewed tens of hours of plays looking for specific things, rewound each play five times, noted all relevant factors every time and then analysed all those compiled notes, and I caveat everything carefully in a nuanced argument” type of eye test. That last thing - no player, coach or GM has time to do, their jobs require them to spend too much time on other stuff.  And yet I would still trust a majority of coaches, gms and above average players with bball IQ too make these type of ratings. Especially with Coaches, I really think you are underselling the sheer amount of film these guys watch. Im willing to be a majority of coaches in the NBA are more qualified to make these assessments than Taylor is."
"Of all the superstars to compare him to, you pick LeBron fucking James lmao"
Yeah he’d be the best player in the league if it wasn’t for a guy named Lebron James existing simultaneously
I wonder where lebron ranks all time in regards to prf? With the inclusion of the 3 ball being so prevalent and that being a primary part of james’ kick out game I wonder if bron ends up passing Stockton in the total points from assist numbers. But Stockton’s total assist number is out of the question.   With the fiery starts that’s doncic and trae going have had I wonder if those two are also in the 40/10/10k club too. It’s conceivable young gets 30/5/9 every year and Luka gets around 28/8/8 every year from here on out in their careers. I don’t know how many more years Russ needs to play to be in contention for this club too.
LeBron James James Worthy Elgin Baylor
Lebron ain’t the best James in the pacific division that crown goes to Justin James
"Arguments to be made for both of 'em, but personally, I'm leaning Lebron James out of a belief that he's simply been matched up against better players. Jordan played in an era where most of the league's best players were Cs and PFs that he wouldn't have been defending, and I'm personally a believer that, as with most professional sports, the average NBA player has only improved over time."
"Sure, let's switch AD and Royce O'Neal and see how Mitchell does.  Deal?   Oh, that's not what you had in mind? I would have assumed you wouldn't want to compare Lebron without AD, who couldn't even make the 8th seed, to Mitchell without AD, but I guess you want to try that discussion despite how bad it makes James look."
"Like the guy below you I was lucky enough to watch both of their careers.  I will say I NEVER saw anything like when Lebron took on and guarded pre injury MVP Derrick Rose in the 2011 playoffs.    Rose shot 1-15 in [games 4 and 5](https://theundefeated.com/features/rememberwhensday-lebron-james-puts-derrick-rose-in-the-torture-chamber/) when Lebron guarded him.  WHAT. THE. FUCK.  I love MJ, hell I love them both, BLOCKED BY JAMES, is still in my youtube rotation.  I also remember exactly where I was when Jordan dispatched the Bad Boys, beat Magic, beat the Jazz and then beat them again."
"Naaaaaaaah bruh. Its Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and then Lebron James. Lets get shit straight!"
"This has a lot of shades of the Backpicks GOAT profiles.  It reads like an homage/love letter, or an imitation if I'm less charitable.  I'm glad there's good discussion, but there's not much I haven't already seen from Ben Taylor other than including Lakers LeBron.   [LeBron](https://backpicks.com/2018/04/05/backpicks-goat-3-lebron-james/)  [Jordan](https://backpicks.com/2018/04/08/backpicks-goat-2-michael-jordan/)"
"Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, and Shaq don't care about a midget like LeBron James in the 1990s, ngl"
"&gt;If you hate Green, you are going hate Matthews twice as much.   &gt;   &gt;In just about every way that basketball players can be compared, Green is better.  There's a reason why Green makes four times what Matthews does, despite Matthews just hitting the open market.  Not only is he not better in every way (it's a wash), Green making 4 times what Matthews does is the main reason *why* we flipped Danny + 1 pick for Schroeder and then signed Matthews; similar value, much cheaper.  Higher paid != better, and there are a billion examples anyone can pull up to demonstrate this, lol. Nic Batum made 27 mil this past year despite the fact there are easily 10 forwards much better than him.  &gt;Not a great game to pick, considering James had a triple-double and Green posted 21 and 4 in 35 minutes, on 7-13 shooting.  LeBron has had a lotta games where he had a triple double but didn't play efficient, wasn't aggressive enough, missed a lot of opportunities, racked up uncontested rebounds and wide open layups to pad his stats in garbage time in order to get the triple double, etc.   This is like bringing up Russ' triple double stats whenever he 'goes off' in a game only to ignore he shot 28% from the field and 19% from 3, lmao. You're missing context.  If you watched that game, Matthews did a much better job on Bron than Green did on any Top 10 guard or forward he played; you're just picking stats out of context.   &gt;Matthews never scored 20 all season.  Cool; we don't even need him to average more than 10, let alone hit 20 in any given game. He just needs to be as efficient as Green, at the least, and play better defense on these guards &amp; wings that Danny can't.  &gt;And Butler's numbers against Milwaukee were just about the same as they were against the Lakers.  Again, picking random numbers out of context. Why compare Butler's total points against MIL vs LAL when neither Matthews nor Green were guarding him for a lot of those games? Especially Wes, who was taken out of the game way too much by Bud, whose brain turns to mush in the playoffs.   When they allowed Wes to guard Butler he nearly neutralized him. When they took him out and put someone like George Hill back on Butler, that's when he feasted.  Butler feasted on Green just as easily as he feasted on most players on our team in the Finals.   &gt;Green, on the other hand, against the Heat, scored more points, had 50% more rebounds, and 600% more assists than Matthews did against the Heat.  Again, random stats outta context that make it sound so disparate. Why not bring up shooting percentage now to compare like you did earlier instead of bringing up raw numbers?  After all, last I remember Green shot 28% from 3 in the Finals... and missed the game winning shot when he was wide open. It was so bad Green sat for long stretches despite being a starter all season because he was so dogshit in the Finals, and is a super streaky shooter all around.  Matthews only has to be as good as him to be an improvement considering his contract, but I think he'll be even more consistent considering his ability to guard premiere guys 1v1 better. There's no debate about this."
Okay. That means nothing. I could say I think Paul George is better than LeBron James cause I’ve seen them both play. But I’d be wrong.
"&gt; At the time  Yes... the 40s-50s. People like to take credit away from Russell and Wilt, imagine 10 years before them.  &gt; AD is much better than Dwight ever was  Lmfao did you never watch prime Dwight? I’m sorry, but AD needs more than one chip on the coattails of Lebron James to overtake a 3x DPOY, perennial all nba first team player, a runner up mvp in 2011, and a Finals appearance, something AD has not accomplished.  Also, AD isn’t even the center, the real conversation should be Giannis vs AD."
Lebron James is better at defending the Chinese Communist Party.
"LeBron James is so good defensively that he was [better than optimized computer models from the Toronto staff](https://grantland.com/features/the-toronto-raptors-sportvu-cameras-nba-analytical-revolution/).  MJ got worked over by bigger players like Magic, but it didn't hurt the Bulls for the most part because of Scottie."
Next thread be like: *Jayson Tatum posterizes LeBron James*
"True superstars are worth far more than their max. I’m talking LeBron, KD, Steph. These guys are individual hard carries who I would say elevate almost any team to a near Finals/contender status, they have huge followings globally and on social media, got their own shoes, and are what I’d consider to be the most transcendent players of this generation.  Then there are players receiving max level contracts and getting paid but I would argue are “overpaid” in that they consume a shit ton of their team’s respective cap space but can be exploited in the playoffs or don’t make their team a heavy contender. Players like Kemba - dude has a gigantic contract but was exploited heavily in the playoffs. Not surprising Ainge tried to shop him around - he’s an undersized guard who’s inconsistent and can’t defend well at all and was very easily exploited, as we saw this year.  Overall it’s just better for the players, it’s just crazy that Kemba Walker is getting paid almost the same salary as LeBron James. Also crazy how big the contracts are of rising stars - Donovan Mitchell, Fox, Tatum. Dudes could make nearly 200M over 5 years if they hit their bonuses. That’s insane for dudes in their younger 20s, who might make considerably more on their next contracts. Dudes like Tatum could be making like 5-600M in salary alone by the ends of their career. That’s wild."
"yes, just last season we saw both Anthony Davis and LeBron James become all stars for example"
"u/mahirs7 's **all true at the defensive end**  **when lebron doesn't get the arguable call on the offensive end, this leads to a turnover.** Now the opposing team is on offense and lebron is nowhere to be seen because he quit on the beginning of a defensive possession. These are the times he's jawing off at the officials **and the opponent gets the easy basket.** There's never a reason the leader should be in the defensive backcourt when he should let the call go and transition to defense. These are what stand out to me as the outlier in this discussion. **there are times, where this would lead to 'blocked by james**, but you'll see him time to time quit on the transition play.  With MJ I'm looking through nostalgia glasses. I'm born 87 so I really only got to watch 90ish through 98. MJ would nonstop be talking to refs all game. There were times MJ would get fouled and he'd act like he got hit by death.  MJ is def goat complainer (by talking to refs all game)... That's how the game evolved, you get acquainted with the refs so they might give you calls. Kobe did it, every superstar is constantly in a conversation with the refs. Every player looking to get MJ calls try to initiate conversation with refs. It has to start somewhere if you believe you're the best player on the planet. When magic and larry conceded, they'd joke about mj getting all the calls.  *****  **TL;DR I'm sure if you in depth check mj career tapes you'll find him quitting on plays during the Bulls years, but you don't remember that. Replays and highlights won't show that. But all I recall is MJ nonstop talking to refs aside from being an offensive juggernaut with an elite defense. lbj will be great, but I see flops, quitting on plays, and leaving games and complaining where his respect is**"
It's odd you say Lebron James is a freak of nature and being one of the most athletic players of the game when the first things I think of to describe him are that he's a real gym rat with a high basketball IQ.
"Kinda pointless though no? If nothing is at stake, and really what could be, then what is the point? You would probably have a lot of:  LeBron James - DNP - Rest  AD - DNP - Rest  Dame Lillard - DNP - Rest  Gary Trent - DNP  - Rest  &amp;#x200B;  The leading minute getter...Caleb Swannigan?"
"My list:  The 50s – George Mikan  The 60s – Bill Russell / Wilt Chamberlain  The 70s – Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   The 80s – Magic Johnson / Larry Bird  The 90s – Michael Jordan  2000s – Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan (Tim being my favorite)  2010s – LeBron James  2020s – ???"
"I legitimately did this in 2001 with this guy named LeBron James when I was 10. I still can't believe I've gotten to be a fan of a guy since he was a junior in high school until he was 35, and he ends up being the 2nd best player of all time."
"It's not hyperbole. His 40 point triple double is one of the best finals performances of all time, *and* it was against LeBron. In terms of Player Efficiency Rating in a finals game it's the 2nd of all time, narrowly edged out by James himself.   https://ca.news.yahoo.com/jimmy-butler-and-the-greatest-nba-finals-games-ever-played-193152497.html"
"No they said James and then lebron....both of those names could mean LeBron lol.  Wasn't giving an opinion either way, just making a dumb joke"
"james regular season, lebron playoffs"
Jeanie buss could be a known cannibal and lebron james and Anthony davis would still be on the lakers. Lakers fans don't get to call people braindead
"As LeBron James aged his lateral quickness has diminished quite a bit. However, he's still a very strong help defender with his strong iq and elite size at his position. He still grades out as a plus defender at 34."
https://www.nba.com/news/lebron-james-explains-why-he-chose-move-los-angeles-lakers-uninterrupted  Basically lakers are the most prestigious franchise.
He traded him to a contender that had LeBron James. It wasn’t like Ainge blackballed him from the league. IT had as much opportunity in Cleveland than he would have in Boston.
"Hmm... off the top of my head:  KD Warriors Lebron Kyrie Love Cavs Heatles Big 3 Celts Spurs Dynasty 04' Lakers Showtime Lakers  Spme of these might be questionable depending on how you view guys like Kevin Love, Manu, Big Game James, etc, but are at least in the discussion"
"Jesus dude you act like we personally backed a brinks truck over his hip and then shipped him to Cleveland. Any GM in the league makes that trade, and he was traded to a contender with fucking LeBron James on the team."
"And we traded him to a contender to be the second star behind Lebron James, stop acting like we moved him to Charlotte"
"LeBron James, Steph Curry, Dame Lillard, I’m not even sure there is a 4th place close to those three."
"It's not like the Pelicans didn't try.   They brought in tons of guys - there's just a simple reality that New Orleans can't attract Lebron James or Kevin Durant in free agency.  They did the best they could.  Which is entirely why AD left at the end of the day - so he could go play with a guy like Lebron.  If that isn't the very definition of ""not loyal"", then I don't know what is.  So you could just as easily turn that quote around ""Anthony Davis... I would never want a guy like that to play for Boston after what he did to the Pelicans... NO LOYALTY... the Pels gave their heart and soul to try to build a winner around AD and he still wanted out... anyone can print that."""
The rockets didn’t beat them because CP3 got hurt. Plus I’m taking a team with Anthony Davis and Lebron James over a team with James Harden and Chris Paul.
Because they had Lebron James on the team and the clippers best player was sga or Danilo at the time.
"It's the lottery aspect that interests fans. Outside of Lebron, KD, and AD, most of the superstars weren't predicted to be superstars. So the possibility of having a sixth man turn in to James Harden or an undersized point guard turning into Steph Curry is great."
Lebron James and Tom Brady May be the Sith Lords we are looking for
LeBron James entering his 104th prime
"Lebron James exited the shower with two bags of soggy popcorn and a towel, asking Ty Lue if he enjoyed the show. After this when he got to his locker, Lebron sat Kyrie on his lap and proceeded to have a conversation with him for a good minute."
"Lol Dallas is a game and a half behind Houston in the standings, and apart from James averaging 9 more ppg their stats are pretty similar. I like both players (and teams). it's not a stupid conversation to be had. Harden would probably get it if Giannis doesnt (or Lebron, bleh)"
You dont waste 2 years of King James by waiting for stars to get out of their contracts. Plus there was always a chance that AD ended up deciding to go somewhere else and then you have to tank with Lebron for his entire length of contract?
"As of today, Harden is ahead of Giannis in per 48 as well on basketball reference. But per 48 is not indicative of value. A player who is on the court is more valuable than a player who is not. And yes, Giannis sits because his team builds big leads. But those are typically against bad teams and wide margins of victory are a much better gauge of how good a team is rather than how good an individual player is.   Five Thirty Eight's rating system is described in depth, but basically, and this is just addressing the offensive RAPTOR, it values players who create space and players create shots for themselves and teammates. It gauges how a player contributes to his teams offense per 100 possessions while on the court versus a league average player. Because of this, traditional post up centers are not going to grade out as well because 538 believes that the modern NBA values players like Steph, LeBron and Harden who can create are more valuable than players who are reliant on other players creating for them. Davis is a post up player who is weak on the offensive boards. He's number 2 in the league in post up percentage, but he only averages 2 offensive boards a game. Add that to his low assist numbers and 538 hits him because he depends on other people to get him the ball to score and he doesn't set up teammates to score.   Now, does this mean Will Barton is a better offensive player than Anthony Davis? No, it means that 538 says he creates 2.5 points for his team per 100 possessions and Anthony Davis creates 2.4 points for his team per 100 possessions. Using a single indicator that separates two players by one tenth of a point is as intellectually dishonest as it is ignorant when trying to make a point about the insane metrics separation James Harden has between himself and the rest of the league in multiple valuation systems."

By that logic Luka Doncic is better than Lebron James now.    We’ve seen guys like Kawhi and Lebron prove what they are and what they can do. There is a difference between whose having a better season and who the better player is. AD is having a better season than Kawhi. AD is not a better player than Kawhi

"it sucked when LeBron refused to shake hands when he lost to the Magic in the ECF  fuck it, the player you're sucking off literally had this to say about shaking hands:  &gt; According to James, no matter what your eyes may lead you to believe on a nightly basis, shaking hands in the League following the game simply doesn’t happen. Nope: “When the reporter reminded James that most players usually shake hands at the end of a playoff series, James bristled again. ‘No you don’t, no you don’t,’ he responded. After a few more seconds of back and forth, James continued to try to explain his position. ‘Teamwork has nothing to do with shaking hands,’ James said. ‘I’m not a poor sport at all. You can ask anyone that knows me, I’m not a poor sport at all. Who brought up the rule that shaking hands, that’s what you’re supposed to do? No one shakes hands at the end of series all the time. No one does that. No one does that at all.”‘"
"Lebron was straight up bad against the Clippers and Bucks too. It's not this simple. We just dont have a secondary floor general that isn't ass(Rondo), which is why there's a big dropoff without James.  The team is also ass without Davis so ya."
LeBron the role player James with a very quiet 17/8/15
I'm pretty sure 99% of r/nba would be shocked to learn that Dennis Rodman was 36 years old on that team and putting up 4.7ppg while being multiple years removed from his last all-defensive team.  All I hear I keep hearing is that Jordan having him on the Bulls is the equivalent of LeBron James having a prime Chris Bosh/Kevin Love.

LeBron James is an exceptional basketball player.
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass"

"&gt; Check out their clutch stats. Kobe is superior.  Alright, let's do just that.  Here's both of their TS% and USG% in the last five minutes of games within 5 points:  [Kobe Bryant](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C_M7syBUwAAYshG?format=jpg&amp;name=small)  [LeBron James](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C_Zgs1dUwAAMc9V?format=jpg&amp;name=small)  Kobe only shot above league-average efficiency four times across twenty seasons, and was an absolute ball-hog from 2003 onwards.  You could reasonably argue he was shooting the Lakers out of games at times, Westbrook-style.  Taking a lot of shots, and missing a lot of them, is inarguably detrimental to your team.  LeBron clearly has his glitches in the playoffs, but he's already hit above league-average seven times in his first fourteen seasons, reaching an elite &gt;60% in five of them.  Neither of these guys are Michael Jordan, but if Kobe is evidently superior to LeBron in the clutch, it isn't because of his scoring efficiency with the game on the line.  Whatever edge he has over LeBron clearly isn't measurable.   &gt; CHeck out who has more 40 point games, 50 point games, 60 point games. It is Kobe.  Kobe has a higher ceiling, sure.  But the points don't carry over between games, and since Kobe averaged less points overall, it stands to reason that those 40/50/60/80 point games were being balanced out by enough off-nights to drag down his totals.  You're not going to argue Kobe was a better scorer than MJ using this logic, I wouldn't think.  &gt; Check out whose peers rate higher as a scorer, kobe. Check out who say is harder to guard, Kobe.  This is a classic Appeal to Authority.  Being great at the game does not automatically make you a great judge of talent, hence why great players generally never become quality executives, GMs, and scouts.  Larry Bird and Danny Ainge are really the exception that proves the rule.  I wouldn't trust Charles Barkley over Masai Ujiri to run my front-office, even though I'm confident Chuck would win a game of one-on-one.  &gt; Also, Kobe's stats look worse than they are as he came off the bench to start his career and then finished off being an inefficient shot chucker.  That's not a point in his favor.  Kobe coming off the bench meant he was more rested, and faced off against worse defenses, so his efficiency should've been supercharged early on.  LeBron was asked to be the focal point of his team's offense from Day One, and he figured it out within one season.  Kobe also played under one of the greatest coaches of all time, while LeBron has dealt with mediocrity for most of his career."

"50,000$ is 50,000$ whether your rich or poor.  Thats a crap load of money, and if you think your rich enough to not care your going to be poor enough to care real soon.  We are not talking about a 50$ parking ticket.  And its not like Thomas is Lebron James, he never got his big contract.  His career earnings are like 13 million$"
"We’re asking who the better player was for the season, not who had the better career or legacy or who’s considered better. Lebron james was not the best player in basketball during the course of the 2018-19 season."
"I won't argue Kobe commands the narrative edge.  He does a phenomenal emulation of Jordan's game, and everyone can remember countless moments where he came up huge for the Lakers.  He's the second-greatest Shooting Guard of all time, make no mistake.  But there just isn't an objective argument that Kobe was the better scorer.  There's only subjectivity like the eye test, player testimony, and arbitrarily valuing some skills over others.  Kobe has better footwork and handles, and a smoother turnaround fadeaway.  I'd even say he has a more aesthetically pleasing game overall.    But the game itself only values what the rules dictate, and that's scoring more buckets than your opponent.  Basketball does not care about aesthetics if it doesn't translate into buckets; James Harden's borderline-unwatchable playstyle is a testament to that.  LeBron scoring more of them, with less attempts, is an air-tight argument that he's better at scoring, and no amount of mental gymnastics can really refute that fact."

"&gt; Rudy Gobert and Steven Adams have to compete with LeBron James, Paul George, and Kawhi Leonard  and that's how it should be. it would be much more of a ""travesty"" if steven adams or rudy gobert started in the all star game."
"What's a travesty is that Jimmy Butler and Joel Embiid are both considered ""forwards"" for the purposes of All Star voting.   Rudy Gobert and Steven Adams have to compete with LeBron James, Paul George, and Kawhi Leonard. Among others. It won't matter for Embiid because he absolutely will start but it's BS regardless."
"&gt;As I read it, the model claims that LeBron James and Steph Curry were bad contracts in 2018-19 (&amp; further that Steph was straight up terrible, one of the worst in the league). We all know that’s not close to correct.  I agree, but it also points to the fact that this model in particular isn't that great a predicting a player's salary in a given year. That doesn't mean the approach doesn't have a lot of potential.  &gt;That along with basic errors like including win shares along with some of the stats that contribute to win shares makes it clear what we’re dealing with here.  I think given this approach, this is one of the least significant critiques.   &gt;Those are some very nuanced, subtle objections to a model that’s clearly terrible in very basic, straightforward ways.  Yes, the model is not incredibly predictive of salary, but at the end of the day, including win shares and box score stats in the model would sort themselves out from the inclusion of more predictive features. As suggested, including additional stats like VORP/RPM is a good start. Even including player position. Although I'd argue, similar to /u/[neutronicus](https://www.reddit.com/user/neutronicus/)'s suggestion, that better contract differentiation and nuance will be necessary to improve this approach. All contract $s and cap space is not created equal. And contracts are more complex than single year payments and can include multiple years of payment, options, different cap constraints, etc.  In the end, these are improvements on this methodology that are relatively reasonable, but what I see as a challenge to this approach is that historic salary paid != salary value. Contracts that break trends may still end up being incredibly valuable - likewise, contracts that follow historic trends may be trash. It is not unreasonable to suggest that the contract market is at times irrational - seeking high risk upside in players at the expense of lower expectations and team value."

No one said he's as good as LeBron James
Just a reminder LeBron James is still the best. He's twice as old and is putting up better numbers.
"Kobe was not robbed of the MVP by Nash. Nash was the guy who made D’Antoni’s system work, and the Suns had the best offense. It’s true that Kobe had better stats, but if we’re giving the MVP to the person with the best stats, then LeBron James should’ve won it over Kobe anyways."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"You are delusional because you are comparing Giannis now to Giannis 2 years ago, as if those were comparable. Giannis has literally improved his per game, per min and per pos every single season no matter how many minutes he played.  In the 2017-2018 season Giannis was 23 years old, played almost 37 minutes per game and his per 36 minute number put him 8th at scoring in the league right next to Lilard and Bron.  You shitting on the soon to be 2 time MVP because when he was 23 he didn't outscore LEBRON FUCKING JAMES. You might qualify as the dumbest person I have met on reddit this whole month.  And if you actually look into the numbers of this year you will see that when he played 35+ minutes his scoring avg around 35 points as well.  &gt; How am I delusional when I’m straight up using numbers to justify my argument?  Referencing a single number utterly out of context ..."

So a team 4 years of sucking can get lebron James in 2003. Then gets Cp3 the next year. Or a team that’s good for 4 years and their star player retires or is injured and have to wait 3 years to rebuild?
"Both of these guys' free throw abilities are on par with their 3 point abilities  LeBron James 34.3%/73.5%  Andre 33.3%/71.0%  League average ~35%/76%  They're pretty much both just slightly below average in both categories. Their 3 point ability *slightly* edges out their free throws, but they're certainly not an exception to the rule that free throw ability is a great predictor for overall shooting"

It's a lot easier to score 27 when you have Lebron fucking James setting you up. Luka is averaging 29 on 61TS while carrying the entire Mavs offense. I get why people will pick AD but give me Luka if you asked me who I'd want on my team.

"Dropping 5ppg last year was not huge my guy. The entire team was injured for very long stretches which is the whole reason he went on a historic run that inflated his numbers. If the team was healthy he would not have had those regular season numbers. He also averaged 34.8 points in the series against the Warriors.  Yikes dude, it's easy to make a player look bad if you are trying to compare them with Lebron James or Jordan in the playoffs because those are all time greats in their eras of basketball. How many players can you actually compare to them? Anyways, Lebron has definitely had seasons where his efficiency has dropped in the playoffs as well.  Keep it up though, I'm having a good laugh at how hard you are trying to shit on Harden with almost no floor to stand on. Your claim that his numbers take a huge nose dive in the playoffs is invalid because his numbers are actually fairly comparable to his postseason numbers with noticeable drop in efficiency but nothing really notable, you just have a hate boner for him and it shows."
"Interesting LeBron James stat: he averages 0 points per game without free throws, three point shots, and midrange shots and any shot in the paint"
Lebron James is nothing but a corporate mouthpiece and every word that comes out of his mouth on social media or interviews is meticulously planned by a board of Nike executives to extract as much money from you mouth breathers as possible.  Also if he played in the 90s he would've just been another Jordan victim and forgotten by now. dab
"Last playoffs his efficiency didn't decrease too much, certainly less than Giannis.  He was actually pretty good even against the Warriors. His TS%, eFG%, his offensive rating, his defensive rating, his AST%, his TRB% all were higher than both KD and Curry, and even his TO% which is one of the things he could be criticized for, was lower than Curry. All that **while shooting 44.7% on friggin stepback threes** during that series.  Against the team that held Lebron ""athlete of the decade"" James to one single game win in his last two Finals against them combined."
"you heard it here, folks. Giannis and James shouldn't be December PotM because LeBron plays better in June"
"Do they have high USG%? Check.   Do they have much higher than average FTA? Check.   High volume 3pt shooter who creates their own shot? Check.  Do they use stepbacks, hesitation moves and dribble heavy isos? Check  Do they frequently put up absolutely obscene box scores? Check.  One of the players who ticks all these boxes and has been doing this for 3 months is literally Hitler. Boring, unwatchable and gives basketball a bad name.  The other player who ticks all these boxes and has been doing this for 2 months is touted as the future face of the NBA, the greatest prospect since Lebron James and is considered one of the most exciting and incredible players in the league."
"It wasn't hard to say, players like Lebron James and Michael Jordan wouldn't even think to start off on their own brand and you think it was justified for a rookie with like 1/100 of the hype of these players out of college to go off and make his own brand? If a player like Lebron James, who was hyped since he started playing basketball didn't think he could make his own brand, why would anyone sensible think Lonzo had a chance. Not to mention the brand was fucking called Big Ball Brand, that sounds like some chinese knockoff brand or a parody company name in a comedy skit."
"-	If Smush Parker rotates to Tim Thomas and he misses the 3, the 2006 Lakers go on to the second round against the Clippers. The Lakers are and have a very good chance of beating the clippers and wish they would face the Mavs in the conference finals. Kobe was lighting up the Mavs that whole entire season so there’s a very good chance that the 2006 Lakers go up against the 2006 Miami Heat in the NBA finals.  -	Chris Paul to the Lakers in 2012 would have allowed Kobe to probably face LeBron James in the NBA finals the following season. Not only that, but there’s a very good chance that Kobe does not tear his Achilles, breaks his knee, or tears that ligament in his shoulder I am probably would’ve been a lot higher on the all-time list for scoring. Maybe even gets to play with LeBron James in 2018.  -	Kobe was robbed of MVPs in 2003 and 2006. That 2000 a MVP probably should’ve been given to LeBron James or Chris Paul, specifically Chris Paul who put up the highest PER of any point guard in NBA history (at that point)  -	Chris Paul went to the clippers in 2012 because David Stern, a former NBA commissioner, created the clippers back in 1984 as an expansion team.

"Again, have you bothered to watch the Lakers at all this year? Go ask any Laker fan if they're irritated by how much Rondo is running the offense this year and the answer will be a resounding ""yes!"" LeBron of course runs the offense a lot as well, but he's quite clearly been looking for someone else to take the load off of him in that respect, really for the last two years.   If (when) Collison signs with the Lakers will he get a lot of spot up opportunities? Of course. But he'll also get a good chunk of time running the offense, and not just when LeBron isn't on the floor. LeBron doesn't like bringing the ball up the floor every time and likes having someone else to run the offense for stretches, even when he's on the floor, and it's driving Laker fans crazy that this has led to Rondo getting as many minutes as he has been.  [The Lakers badly need a secondary playmaker](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2019/10/25/20930876/lebron-james-los-angeles-lakers-anthony-davis-analysis-playmakers-play-types) and guy to run the offense, and that's been the case all year. [The Laker blog Silver Screen and Roll wrote about that literally the day before Collison said he was thinking about returning to the NBA.](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2019/12/31/21028890/lakers-news-point-guard-alex-caruso-minutes-frank-vogel-rajon-rondo-quinn-cook-troy-daniels) Collison would be a *perfect* fit for them.   He would be a help for the Clippers as well, nobody is saying he wouldn't be. It's only you that seems to think he wouldn't help the Lakers at all. I'm sorry, you're just wrong about this, I don't know what else to tell you. Try watching the actual games before attempting to speak so authoritatively about this stuff maybe? It'll save you some embarrassment going forward. Other than that I've got nothing more for you."
Am I the only one who doesn’t think he’s the second coming of LeBron James? I don’t think he’ll bust but when was the last time a game changing superstar started their NBA career with knee injuries and not playing? Hype trains get way out of control nowadays.
Yeah like lebron James. So far his numbers are speaking for themselves. There’s no discussion comparing butler and doncic.
"For someone who claims to watch basketball as much as you do, even making a comparison between this team and the LeBron James Heat is absolutely asinine.   You're part of the ""everything is fine"" crew. That's fine. I get wanting to believe in the fairy tale where Brown gets to go through the process years and then finally hoist up that trophy. Is very Disney-esque.   But we have a point guard who literally won't shoot a basketball three years running. He's utterly destroying the offense out there. We have a team that can't break a 2-3 zone. That can't break a full-court press. We are once again turnover prone. We don't show up against lesser competition. We are straight up bad on the road.   That's all coaching. Enough of moving the goalposts and prioritizing Brett Brown and his personality over the 76ers. He's not getting the job done."
"- Philly needs to move on from Ben Simmons this year. His lack of willingness to shoot hurts them.   - LeBron is still the best player in the world. His impact is undeniable, but Giannis is the MVP and is getting super close to taking LeBron’s crown.   - AD is a great player but he’ll never lead a team to a championship as it’s best player. He’s a 2.   - James Harden has a legitimate chance to pass Kobe as the 2nd best SG of all-time.   - Pops philosophy doesn’t really work anymore. San Antonio should move on from him as well as LMA &amp; Derozan and completely rebuild."
The answer is so obviously LeBron james
"i read ""Lebron James"" for ""James Harden"" and clicked, thinking this will be good. Should have been Lebron."
Well LeBron James is a Liverpool minority owner. So Lakers.
"Trading away Billups was damaging to the Pistons obviously but it made sense in many ways at the time:  1. Rip and Rasheed were slowing down.  Ben Wallace was no longer on the team but it didn't matter since was slowing down anyway. A rebuild was imminent. 2. Stuckey was a promising young player at the time and many saw him as the successor to Billups 3. As great as Billups was, it became obvious that the status quo was no longer going to work as Lebron James emerged as the best player in the league.  There was no way a declining Pistons team was going to compete against a Lebron who was growing more dominant by the day, and who already dispatched the Pistons as a 22 year old in the 07 playoffs. 4. While Iverson was never seen as the franchise savior, Detroit was in a ""no win"" situation by keeping Billups.  Iverson was an interesting experiment since he had the ability (even at that age) to create his own shot as a triple threat.  Keep in mind Rip Hamilton and Rasheed Wallace, as great as they were, were essentially ""catch and shoot"" players.  Chauncey Billups had a great 3 point shot but he never had the footspeed to create his own shot in tight spaces come playoff time.  That was part of what doomed the Pistons during their 07 playoff run. The Iverson gamble was a low risk move since his contract was expiring anyway.  And asides from what I listed above, a whole bunch of other stuff happened over the years (Josh Smith, players revolting against coach kuester, etc) that sunk the Pistons."

"The reason I don't see Harden as having quite the same shot as the other 3 is that at this point, the league is so tired of the Rockets style of play, and Harden scoring 35-40 points a night. It's still impressive as hell, but it's the same reason Westbrook stopped winning MVP. He was still averaging triple doubles, but everybody knew at that point that Russ averaging triple doubles was the way of the league, and so it got boring. MVP tends to be about story. ""James Harden can still score crazy amounts of points, even a little more than last year,"" is a story voters have heard before, and since the Rockets are still middle of the pack in the West, he won't win because he and the Rockets aren't doing anything new. Luka's above him for me because Luka is by far the best player, in his second year, on a team looking to finish 3rd or 4th in the West that was expected to finish 7th-9th. Because he's so young, and passing all the expectations people had for him and his team, (plus the LeBron parallels don't hurt,) he's become a great player with a fun to watch story around him. Then there's LeBron and Giannis who are obvious choices, and both have slightly more interesting circumstances that make people want them to win."
"LeBron is the King of this advanced stat shit. MJ was famous for all the **black ink** he had and James is the same but for the [playoffs.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html#playoffs_advanced::none) Pretty impressive that Kawhi edges out LBJs 2009 run in PIPM. That 2009 year by LeBron is the GOAT individual performance by many metrics. BPM+18 in 14 games. Really speaks for Kawhi's run 2017, dude looked unstoppable and made tough bucket after tough bucket."

"Yea they were considered elite because Lebron James carried them to 66 and 61 games, he did not have nearly the same help Giannis has today on those early Cavs teams."
Because James Harden or LeBron are clearly better. Although it is a popularity contest and he’s white so I guess it makes sense

Couldn’t have said Harden? James is a very common name and is mostly associated with Lebron

"leagues with relegation have no parity, look at la liga theres only 3 teams with a realistic chance to ever win that league  and I don't mean this year, I mean 20 years from now there will still only be barca and real madrid fighting it out every season  NBA is already bad enough with superteams, but at least theres a chance to draft a lebron james and turn your franchise around for a bit"
I was always the skinny one and once i got matched up with equaly skinny guy... cant nobody tell me basketball doesnt rely on strenght. Literally first time in my life when i didnt have to put up some circus shot while being off balanced by pushoffs everytime i drove. You have to got physical advantage in this sport. The only skinny guys at the top level are the most talented tall guys like Durant or Ingram. James Harden or LeBron basicaly buldoge their way to the rim
"I'm going to be honest with you and I don't mean this in a rude way but it's very apparent you don't watch many Laker games if any at all.  You keep insisting that if Collison joins the Lakers all he'll do is just sit in the corner despite me telling you he would still run the offense a lot. Watch any Laker game and see how much Rondo runs the offense. That's what Collison would do on the Lakers as he'd take Rondo's job.   I can see you're really struggling with this so I suggest you read [this article](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/darren-collison-could-be-the-break-that-the-lakers-need-to-catch-the-clippers-and-win-a-championship/) which breaks it down perfectly:  &gt; Darren Collison... is, on paper, a nearly perfect fit for this team. Though not initially an elite 3-point shooter, he grew into one later in his career. He led the league by shooting nearly 47 percent from behind the arc during the 2017-18 season, and remained above 40 percent last season. He is not a reckless shooter though, as his volume has remained relatively low. That is by design. Last season, nearly 58 percent of his long-range attempts were defined as wide open by NBA.com. Wide-open shots are plentiful when playing alongside Davis and James.   &gt; He is not the traditional point guard-sized human who occupies the position solely to feast on the 3's LeBron creates, though. His offensive game is far more diverse. The Pacers scored 0.92 points per 100 possessions when he ran pick-and-roll last season, putting him in the 72nd percentile league-wide. He was in the 83rd percentile a year earlier, and both numbers came with inferior spacing to what the Lakers would provide. The Lakers lack a secondary pick-and-roll threat beyond James offensively. No guard on their roster is even in the 50th percentile this season.   &gt; Collison is even a moderately effective defender. At 6-0 flat, he is too short to hold up on switches, but is more than fast enough to stay in front of just about anyone and largely stays within the scheme rather than gambling for big plays. For a Lakers team that focuses on conservative closeouts and trying to funnel shots into their rim-protectors, that is a valuable defender. Add all of this up and Collison is more than just the potential missing piece for the Lakers. He is a nearly ideal fit for them in almost every way.   &gt; His two top choices, should he ultimately decide to return, are the Lakers and the Clippers. That makes sense. Collison grew up in Southern California and attended UCLA. He has also played for both Doc Rivers and Frank Vogel in the past, **but with Patrick Beverley and Lou Williams in place, the Clippers don't have many minutes to offer him.**  &gt; The Lakers do. They also have a financial advantage over the field. When DeMarcus Cousins tore his ACL over the summer, the Lakers applied for, and received, a $1.75 million Disabled Player Exception. That exception was downright worthless at the time, as the veteran's minimum is higher than that. But unlike the minimum player salary exception, DPE's don't prorate. Most other teams will only be able to offer him a portion of the minimum, and a small one at that if he is committed to waiting until after the trade deadline to find a home as Wojnarowski suggests, while the Lakers will have that entire $1.75 million exception at their disposal. "

This is why you keep a Jarred Dudley on your bench. Also this is why fuckin LeBron James.
Point center Lebron James. 48 year old playing every position diving on the floor leading the league in assists. Decides to be an elite big man tonight because their entire frontcourt is out.  Lmao
Imagine if Jack Black was your dad. Or LeBron? Your friends would have to be upset with LeBron Fucking James.
How does LeBron James get 1/12th the FTs of a sophomore with how much contact he goes through on drives?
luka catching a lot of difficult comparisons this thread lol  getting outshined by lebron and being a poor man's james harden is pretty good when you're like 20 years old

LeBron James
Because he is one of the legitimate greatest basketball players ever. The only star in the NBA who plays better in the playoffs than regular season right now is LeBron James and maybe Kawhi but he gets the benefit of resting half the season. It’s a tough thing to do
"Lebron James, u/Smekledorf1996, and u/KailuaMan have scored more career points than Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Steph Curry COMBINED"

And the final circle of hell shall be opened and Miami will be permanently out of basketball purgatory after selling their souls to Lebron James.
Add me to LeBron James' side.
"Your current squad minus the two stars is still a better supporting cast than a lot of AD's Pelicans teams were. The Pelicans just added a bunch of assets from trading AD, and are still one of the absolute worst teams in the league.  Y'all are like 10 deep with solid role players, only one or two of whom are playing disappointing. Y'all don't lack talent, you lack a backup point guard to run an offense when LeBron sits. It's a pattern that's held on a lot of his teams, [he's even pointed it out himself](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18419056/lebron-james-says-cleveland-cavaliers-need-point-guard?sf49755117=1) ffs."
LeBron James is a scorer pls don't say things like this ever again nephew twice removed.
The fuck. Lebron James is a far better player than Kevin Durant.
Kawhi Leonard while guarded by me this year: 0 points.   Lebron James while guarded by me this year: 0 points.
"I agree. Give LeBron and AD Klay and Draymond and that is even better than golden state.     You know the  5 shooter of all time all defensive player who is clutch as they come. A dude that in game 6 last year before he got hurt had 27 in less than 3 quarters of the finals. the dude that broke KD's sprit so badly in game 6 of 2016 that KD gave up and joined golden state    and   The guy who has been the best defenisve player of the playofdfs in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and was the best regular season defender for a few of those years as well. A forward who can average 7 assist a game and push transition fast breaks as good as anybody    Give LeBron James and Anthony Davis those guys and it is same over.      Lebron is so much better than KD or Curry it isn't even funny and you give him the best big man and a top 5 defender in the NBA who will also average an super efficient 28/10/3.  They're just on another level"
I’d rather have any of the following on my team:  In no particular order 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Luka Doncic 3. Steph Curry 4. Lebron James 5. Kevin Durant 6. Anthony Davis 7. James Harden 8. Kawhi Leonard 9. Karl Anthony Towns 10. Pascal Siakam 11. Joel Embiid 12. Jimmy Butler  13. Paul George  14. Kyrie Irving  15. Klay Thompson 16. Bradley Beal 17. Damian Lillard 18. Nikola Jokic 19. Trae Young 20. Devin Booker 21. Donavon Mitchell  22. Kemba Walker 23. Kyle Lowry  There’s probably arguments for some other guys too but those are the guys I’d firmly take over Gobert. So he is roughly top 25 Imo
"I continue to think Beilein is a good coach, and he can do good things.  The problem is that the Cavaliers as an organization are rotten.

"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father. I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know. I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people. and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s. I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better. he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?"" and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league? I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now..... until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible.. edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass. edit2: i just thought of something else, i've been pinning this on ""the government"" when there are plenty of private companies and organizations with the funding and technology to do something like this. i mean people this is 2015.....wouldn't you be more shocked if by this point someone HADN'T tried to create a super human by now? but you never thought that you might have been watching one this whole time."

"Like I said, it was common among Lakers fans and hot take-spewing sites like B/R. The author of the article you included typed the following, presumably with a straight face:   &gt;In any NBA trade value chart, the only player that should rank higher than Bynum is LeBron James.  As if Kevin Durant wasn’t already a dominant force a full year younger than Bynum. That’s your source? Yea, some people thought it to be true. These are the same people who sway their opinions based on clickbait and hot takes they see on tv. They were not the majority or even close to it. Dwight was a proven commodity; Bynum was an injury-prone but very gifted up-and-comer with the hype of the Lakers fan base behind him."
Hornets legend LeBron James
Sorry I forgot Lebron James is and has been a consensus GOAT his entire career and ben simmons can't even make an all star game consistently. C'mon dude
"I've never said Lebron James doesn't show up in big moments. I've been fortunate to witness many of them in person, including his first NBA game, his first buzzer beater, and 3 Finals game. There's a strong argument that he is the greatest player of all time. I'm not just a kid from Akron, Ohio, I'm a Lebron James fan.  That being said, there have been periods of time where he has been mentally disengaged. It's a passive moodiness,different than the coasting he's done on regular season defense for the last decade. I would agree that hasn't really happened in the playoffs since he got that first title."
LeBron James
Haaaaaaaard pass.  Y'all really seem to think Ben Simmons is Lebron James or something.
"Thats just not true, man. Come on. Jordan, a 6'6""guard was not a better PnR roller than LeBron James, a 6'8"" SF/PF. He also was not as good at team defense as peak LeBron. His man to man defense was probably better on the perimeter, but at those two's level you really aren't gonna see much actual difference in a game. And LeBron was a better post defender. And being a 40% 3pt shooter like James is really fucking important to how good and unguardable he was. And LeBron's playmaking was miles ahead of Jordans. LeBron is the best non-PG playmaker of all time. As for Bird... Lol dude come on."
"""Gotta lock down KCP and Avery Bradley; let's make LeBron James beat us"""
"&gt; Um, yeah, having a better season makes you a better player in that year.  It means you're playing better. It doesn't make you better.   Harden is playing better than LeBron and has been for a couple of years now. At no time has he been a better basketball player than LeBron James."
"I don’t know, does inviting speculation or begging for attention really sound like LeBron James?"
"The only reason I'd say the Clippers is LeBron James. I don't trust their role players one bit, but he's done some ridiculous things over the years without a player of Davis' caliber."
"The specifics aren't really that important to it. I'll offer the chance to escape the reading:  You have the names and assume I am to defend the point I made earlier. Pau Gasol, Blake Griffin, Marc Gasol. 3 white players who were atleast, a bit on athletic side as well as very talented for a period. They exemplify that hypothetical. White players are not disproportionately liked because they're white.  If you fancy the read:  Pau Gasol was probably top 5-10 in the league for the PF during his peak, yeah? Was he even remotely ass close to popularity as Luka Doncic? Conference? Nope. Division? Nope. The most popular on his team? Nope. But he's white.  Blake Griffin: Arguably the most exciting rookie ever. Literal highlight machine. Has some of the greatest dunk highlights ever. Very popular player, for sure. Athletic? 100%. White? Yes. Best player ever? No. Roundly considered the best player in any season? No. Was it ever close? No.  Marc Gasol: Do I even need to need to bother?  Jokic: The best center in the league? Close. Maybe. Top 3? 100%. Is he fast? Fuck no. Is he agile? Ha. Does he look buff? Erm. Dunks though, aye? Not really. He only passes better than a majority of players in history, gets 20 points every game, rebounds well and all the while, looks completely incapable of running 5k, never mind competing in the athlete driven NBA.  Porzingus: He's 7'3, more than a solid athlete and unique. All that potential. Was super popular during the breakout year. Obvious reasons. Now, no more popular than any second tier player in a decent market, or star in a big market.   Luka Doncic: Looks a bit like Jokic, plays a bit like Jokic. Ok, not really. They both look like they should be too slow, even if Luka is actually kinda quick. Much more underhandedly athletic than he'll ever be given credit for. Also: the best 20yr old ever. Has a cute accent and none of that hyper machismo shit. Figuratively, acts like a 9yr old. More hyped than Lebron, at that age? 1st year? Not really but close. Second year? 100%. Is it justified on the court? Fuck yeah.   Caruso: If you can't see why he's popular at the moment. You're a hopeless feckwit. Undrafted, solid player, with the worst hair ever. The worst hair do, in the NBA. The NB fucking A. Featuring: Elfrid Payton's floppy dick hair. Lonzo Balls rookie wtfuckut. Dwights vagina braids and so on and on and on and on and on and on. Dunks. Memes.  Comparable black players:   Blake: Dwight...? Yeah. I'll go with Dwight. We all watched Dwight. Dwight was wayyyyy more popular during the the same career window.   Jokic: There's no-one that comes close. Ergo... Disproportionate popularity.  Pau Gasol: idk, there's been like 30-40 players in similar positions the last 20 years alone.  Marc Gasol: 60 or so players in that all-star but not all nba in a small market.  Luka: Lebron James, touted as a potential GOAT before drafted. Athleticism of unrivalled proportions. So, again, not really comparable in anything but impact and hype.  Caruso: Im stuck here. Maybe this one sells it.  I'm not some savante NBA historian. I don't remember everyone and everything but I think I'm pretty safe in saying that when someone says Luka/Jokic is popular because he's white, I got to ask: Why can't it be because he's doing it better than everyone else by being JUST so good at basketball."
"So you’re comfortable comparing Kyrie to Kareem. Because that’s the idiotic statement made to start this: GS and Cavs had a rivalry comparable to Bird and Magic.  In comparison to that, yes, he *was* along for the ride.  (Quick aside: look at where Bron is today? Top of West.) Agreed LeBron needed help, hell he didn’t even beat the KD + Warriors, which again was part of the magic of Magic v. Bird, fully assembled they each got wins.  But whatever I’m done with this conversation because everyone is just gonna see “discounted Kyrie”.  No. The point of comparison was Lakers v Celtics. To that end, Kyrie fits in closer to a Michael Cooper or James Worthy or if you switch the teams, a McHale or Ainge not like there was two Larry Birds. Valuable to the team, but none of those guys went and got a championship on their own.  It was a good run for those two teams, but the Finals matchups were kinda shitty with Kyrie and KLove injured, and KD joining the Warriors and stomping the Cavs 8-1.  If KD didn’t join and Kyrie and KLove stay healthy, it’s a lot more comparable."
"List of players 35 years old or older in the NBA currently:   Vince Carter	 Udonis Haslem Kyle Korver	 Nenê Hilário	 Tyson Chandler Andre Iguodala	 Thabo Sefolosha	 Carmelo Anthony	 JJ Redick	 J.J. Barea	 LeBron James  2, maybe 3 of those players contribute to winning basketball at this point. It's possible, Jimmy makes it that long, but I wouldn't put money on it."
"What are you even saying? Don't know how you got to comparing whole franchises value vs Bron, but there's no way Steph was more valuable to those GSW teams than LeBron was to Cle. Take Klay and Dray off of the 2015 or 2016 finals team like James was without Kyrie and Love and that team gets smashed."
What are you talking about Lebron won you 3 championships and the only reason you are relevant now is because Jimmy wanted to live in Miami.  You didn't build Jimmy Butler or Lebron James they came pre-built.
"Bro it’s not ‘this season’, it’s the city of Cleveland... forever. With the exception of the Lebron James era, the city of Cleveland has been a steaming dumpster fire of a shit show for the past 50 years or so."
"All the greats have *not* done it -- Magic, Bird, Kareem, Shaq, Duncan, etc.  But, today, it's like a power 5 conference football team refusing to schedule an American Conference or other good group of 5 school. The power 5 school perceives no benefit from winning the games that exceeds the risk of loss.  LeBron James doesn't have enough to gain from winning a dunk contest that would justify participating. Other than that, perhaps he doesn't even value the dunk contest, I don't know.  But props to him for not participating if he doesn't want to."
Jimmy Butler is the definition of fake tough. His history is starting shit with role players and rotation players who he is obviously clearly better than. He then trashes them to the media because his feelings get hurt and he has to compensate for it to look tough and cool. He trashes lesser competition to inflate his huge ego. Imagine LeBron going off to the media about an altercation with TJ McConnell or Mason Plumlee. Imagine LeBron trashing dudes like this. It would never happen because actual tough players don't need to remind people how tough and cool they are all the time. James Butler goes after stiffs to make himself look tough and badass because his ego needs constant media validation and attention. Like its fucking TJ Warren dude shut the hell up.
Lebron James
"Can you imagine if LeBron James wasn’t born in Akron, Ohio?"
Interesting beef. Warren is a respectable scorer 18 a game at 58.4% TS.    It's not like that pathetic Deshawn 'Soulja boy' Stevenson vs LeBron 'Jay-Z' James.
"For a long time. it was because they were such a powerhouse of our division and conference and talked all their shit along the way. Unlike us who up until like 2013 didn’t start really succeeding in the east, Cause of lebron mostly, but that’s it’s own joke. Kevin garnett’s celtics especially were tough. Then once the demar/lowry combo caught fire with good backup, we started becoming contenders. However the celtics never really stopped being contenders, Even between the finals Celtics and the isaiah thomas years they still were trouble for us. Eventually we became better than them, but telling you all this is only a Little relevant. because even Though they’ve been dicking us down for years, they’ve still been ass. I’m sorry but the Celtics coast off of 16 titles carried to them on a silver platter by white people god and a giant pimp 30 and 50 years ago respectively and still talk shit to everybody else like they have done something, make the finals just once please, oh wait, you can’t because of lebron james, but he’s our dad? i’m sorry my franchise didn’t exist in 1968 or 1984 but you’re still losing to lebron just like us assholes, they act like isaiah thomas and brad stevens were phil and mike or something. celtics fans and new england fans and media are the worst thing ever, i love the people on the celtics, i loved kyrie when he was there, but they have been on the same level as us and like 3 other teams for 5 years now, the celtics just Suck."
LeBron James!

LeBron James vs Bronny James
"Just for the record I personally think Lebron will be better regardless if Kawhi wins 3 or even 4 championships. Kawhi doesn't have same career accolades, awards, or longevity. Lebrons impact on the game is immeasurable, he has been the undisuted best player on the planet for the past decade. Kawhi has a long road ahead before we can even put his name in the same breath as Lebron James. This post was created to gage the opinion of r/nba not as a troll/bait post.  Thank you for attending my ted talk."
Imagine LeBron james on those spurs teams
"&gt; Name one person even close to as talented as AD besides Giannis on those Bucks.   There's no one. They don't have to be as talented as AD. We see the difference between when LeBron sits vs when Giannis sits. Giannis teams can smack teams and keep a lead. Or even stomp sub 500 teams without him. I'm not saying that to shit on giannis. I'm just speaking matter of facts. It's more of a testament to Lebron James.  Lebron James team even with AD playing can't even keep a lead if lebron james is on the bench or out for the game. He's so vital to that team. One can argue, he's MVP just because of how he's able to keep a team that bad second seed in the nba, first in the west.   (I still side with giannis as mvp)  They're the los Angeles Pelicans when Lebron Sits. When AD sits, they at least have a shot to win ball games."
"Your picks coming up in the next couple years are probably not gonna be franchise changing but by 2024/2026 I would be shocked if the current Clippers or Rockets core is still competing.  Guys like Harden, Kawhi and PG are in the middle of their prime right now and for players not named LeBron James those usually don't last a decade. Unless they absolutely nail a draft pick or Billy King gets another front office job it will hard for them to remain contenders as Kawhi and Harden age out of their prime and take a step back"
You are talking about LeBron Fucking James
"If Kawhi sat out with the bucks and missed 22 games, they would have a record that was comparable to the raptors of last year. That's still a 50 plus win team, maybe even 55. They're in the east. They've smacked all the sub 500 teams for the most part. That roster is deep. They're a great defensive team even without giannis.  This is not a Lebron James scenario where its a lottery team without him. Even the lakers are a lottery team without Lebron"
"Hit the nail on the head there. And tbh these reviews are just making things worse, like that harden ""missed dunk"".  Lebron james himself said ""they're never gonna overturn it"" regarding challenges; the NBA really needs to overhaul something quick because this shit is just gonna get worse"
"He’s a 24 year old guy from Flint, Michigan living in LA as a millionaire. A guy who was lightly recruited out of highschool, spent 4 years at Utah and then was drafted 27th but has out performed his draft position.   So what if he likes what his life is like right now, wouldn’t you?   Combination of a level of hard work most of us have never put in plus a lot of luck has landed him in a position to play for the most popular franchise in the NBA, with LeBron James, seeing himself on Puma billboards etc.   Nobody on this sub in his position would disagree with what he said about LA vs. Orlando."
"I know. Its nothing personal.   I don't deny Giannis is a monster. I don't deny that giannis will have higher upside. I don't deny that he has better stats, accolades and all that. You can have all that.  My criteria is different than yours and I don't see him as a better player than kawhi leonard. Is it subject to change if giannis wins? Sure. Giannis clearly has a better team on paper. Clippers have bigger names, but Bucks have better fit. The stats suggest that argument so far. Plus they have the better player, mvp on paper. If giannis gets beaten by the clippers or LeBron james in the finals, then He's not number 1 to me. Unless he's balling really out of control. Like averaging like 35 - 10-9 but his team chokes.  But if kawhi outplays him despite having a team that's statistically worse, then I'm going to give it to kawhi. especially if he does it on one leg again."
James Harden or LeBron probably
"Grizzlies trade Iggy, Josh Jackson and Solomon Hill for LeBron James.  BOLD!!!"
"Nearing 60 TS% on the season, placing him firmly ahead of:    * Kawhi Leonard * LeBron James * Kyrie Irving * Nikola Jokić * Jimmy Butler * Kemba Walker * Donovan Mitchell * Pascal Siakam  His previous high-mark was 55.5 TS% back in 2017-18.  Dude has unlocked something since December."
"The Three Laws of a LeBron James Team:  1) The team plays great with LeBron on the floor  2) The third scorer always struggles to get acclimated  3) The team sucks with LeBron off the floor  Doesn't matter who's playing what role on the team.  All-star, scrub, doesn't matter.  Those are the laws."
Bonus Facts:  The difference between 1. Lebron and 2. James Harden in overall RPM (3.03) is the almost the same as the difference between 2. James Harden and 10. Paul Millsap (3.19).  Alex Caruso is 8th in DRPM and 17th in RPM!
Larry Bird   Dirk Nowitzki  Lebron James  Tim Duncan  Kevin Garnett  Would be the goat Power Forward starting 5
"Cause it has for LeBron in the past, and I think he still has the largest fanbase in the NBA.   Giannis was ahead of James in 2018 following the first returns. James came out on top."
"Pretend you're a gm. Barring no injuries. You can have any player you want to start a team to lead you to a title but you only have three years to win a chip.  Who do you think people are going to choose?  You think people going to choose James harden over kawhi? I don't think so.  I think the top choices are LeBron, kawhi and KD.  Curry would be forth and Giannis fifth and harden sixth.   Harden is a better individual performer than anyone in that top 5. One of the best scorers period. But he's committed to his play style which many are unsure if it's winning championship basketball."
"""There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Cedi Osman gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Collin Sexton yelled out, “We got an [expletive] trade now.” And before Love hit the locker room door, former Cavs great LeBron James hugged him and said, “You (bleeping) need me. You can’t win without me!"""
"I like Kawhi but I’m sorry it’s just fucking stupid .The fact of the matter is that he has a situation that works for him right now and he’s abusing it.The clippers know they have the best squad in the NBA at least on paper so they afford Kawhi the luxury to sit.Meanwhile James Harden,LeBron and Giannis are over here pulling the weight of team every night for 80 games a season"
Lebron James is a pussy ass bitch anyway.
"This was the play of the game. In a game where Jaylen Brown posterized LeBron James. Marcus fuckin Smart, nastiest passes in the league."
"Lebron James, -21. Anthony Davis, -24. Kuzma, -13"

Celtics Kemba Walker is undefeated against Lebron James when
"Whenever I read that quote it always reminds me of a game LeBron had not too long after Kobe said that.  On May 25, 2015, the Cavs were facing the Atlanta Hawks in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Kevin Love was out for the remainder of the playoffs and Kyrie was visibly suffering from tendinitis in his knees. LeBron started the game going 0/10 from the floor.   LeBron James then proceeded to put up 37 points, 18 rebounds and 13 assists in a close game to give the Cavs the win, 114-111. Down 109-111 with 30 seconds left in overtime, LeBron hit a 3 point shot to put the Cavs up 1 point, and then with 13 seconds left in the game he hit a midrange jumper which sealed their victory."
Trade LeBron James for a 3D
"So you’re point is that because of a 3 game sample size, Hardens style doesn’t work in the playoffs? As though Harden doesn’t have by far the most recent  post season success for any player that either didn’t a) play on the warriors or b) is named Lebron James."

Kemba Walker officially begins his winning streak against LeBron James
LeBron James doesn't care about black people.

"jeez man you're so obnoxious it's almost like you're one of those anti-vaxxers.    here i'll do the work for you.    &gt; The Cavaliers' star was asked about an ESPN report that the organization was worried the team wasn't responding to its rookie head coach. His initial response wasn't exactly a ringing endorsement. When asked if Blatt was the ""right"" coach for the team, James demurred.

James asked rhetorically of qualifying for the postseason after the game, via ESPN. ""I'm playing devil's advocate, you know? It's kind of a fine line when you talk about that, because when you've never been there or know what it takes to actually shoot for something like that, sometimes you're afraid to get uncomfortable.  &gt; ""So you got to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. So I'm not saying that's what we are as a whole. It kind of looks that way at times, that sometimes we're afraid to be uncomfortable and kind of get out of our comfort zone and kind of, you know, have that sense of urgency from the jump, and not be afraid to actually go out and fail to succeed.

"Rob Pelinka yelled, “There you go!” Jeanie Buss gave a look of pleasant surprise. Stu Lantz belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Magic Johnson hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Y'all gotta chill with the terrible takes because of this performance. In no order Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, LeBron James and then who else? KAJ? Wilt? Malone?"
"I’ve been saying this all season, but Houstons team is not very good and the sooner people realize it, the sooner people will realize serious change is needed.   This system works on 2 tenants: James harden being incredible, and surrounding him with space both horizontally (through having shooters) and vertically (through the lob threat). It’s enough to win a bunch of games because harden is absolutely amazing, but when he’s not, you really notice how absolutely thin this team is, how gimmicky the system can be at times, and how mediocre of shooters there are surrounding harden. Hardens brilliance and the scheme have convinced us that Austin rivers, Ben mclemore, and danuel house are great shooters, but they are really more average shooters that get good looks. But they also lack any creativity in their system besides harden.  Obviously your best player pushes your team, but you need to have a system in place for when he doesn’t have it going. This has been mentioned for those cavs teams that would fall apart anytime lebron would sit, it’s because there was no system once the star wasn’t doing everything."
This guy fucked lebron James mom
"Basketball is a team sport. Not a 1 vs 1 sport. Any team that forgets this will never EVER win a championship.   For all the people that defend this disgusting, unwatchable style of play, citing his average points per game or ""efficiency"", do you realize like half his points come from free throws most games? If you shoot and miss but get fouled it doesn't even count as a miss.   Anyone can chuck brick after brick a million times a game, constantly flop and get a high amount of points. But there's a reason the Rockets aren't a contender.  I mean Lebron James got an MVP chant at their home court...while Harden was playing. That should tell you all you need to know."
Yeah man if Lebron had joined the Pelicans he would've completely turned it around.  Lebron James is better than Anthony Davis. This isn't really even a debate.
Danny Green and Dwight messing around when LeBron James does his chalk toss is always quality entertainment.
"&gt; “...air of professionalism...”  You like Lebron James and the Lakers?  Their early work was a little too ‘Lonzo Ball’ for my taste. But when Anthonty Davis joined in '19, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole team has a clear, crisp dribble, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the plays a big boost. He's been compared to Michael Jordan, but I think Lebron has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor."

"Do you think that if Minnesota had drafted LeBron James in 2003 that they would have ended up with 1 or 0 rings? I believe that they and every other organisation in the NBA if given LeBron James for 11 years, would have won at least 2 rings. The Cavs got one because they are that bad."
"""Cleveland has traded Lebron James for Pareto Principle, league sources tell me"" - WOJ, probably"
"As I said, I agree because it would be an exception to the 'rule', but there are a couple things that work in Zion's favor here. Not only is he the most hyped prospect since LeBron James, but the timing for him is a lot better than it was for Embiid despite his competition being much stronger.  I mean, yeah, even if he's fully healthy after he returns and doesn't miss a single game til the end of the season, he likely won't play much more games than Embiid did in his rookie year, but the thing about Embiid's rookie season is that he missed the whole 2nd half of the year.  While people didn't exactly forget about him by any means, the fact that he wasn't relevant on the court since mid January definitely hurt his case, and the moment the news came out that he won't be coming back everyone was already like ""yeah, 30 games ain't gonna cut it, someone's gonna catch up soon"". Even though no one really got close to catching up, the fact that it was such an anti-climactic end to a RotY campaign was a bad look... and we're still missing some more context there that hurts his case - even before he played his first game the biggest concern about him wasn't anything related to his game, but his ability to stay healhty, and quite a bit of people took his rookie season being over midway through it as a 'proof' that he's just Greg Oden 2.0.  On the other hand if Zion is able to push through the whole rest of the season, that campaign is still gonna be fresh in terms of hype after he's done with it, as long as his numbers are good enough.  Say, he puts up big numbers, and Pelicans squeeze into the 8th seed, or barely miss the playoffs while carried by his performances, that's gonna make for one hell of a storyline... and media people who are voting for the RotY are gonna ride the hell out of it, and when that's one of your main talking points for like half the regular season leading up to the playoffs (especially if he starts off strong the hype could take over the ASB buffer for whole lot of shows and podcasts) then they could easily be more inclined to vote for him than they would for Embiid playing like 30 out of first 40 games."
Lebron James - Kawhi Leonard
"&gt; The LeBron James foundation says it's spending about $2 million for the school's first year, including startup costs. It has also committed to spending $2 million or more a year when the school has grown to capacity. The exact amount is still to be determined.  So he’s spent $2 million, the school isn’t at full capacity for a few more years.   &gt; I Promise will eventually cost about $8 million a year to run out of the district's regular budget, covered mostly by shifting students, teachers and money from other schools, the district says.  So even when he does start spending more, it’ll only be 25% of costs. The rest is funding from tax payers that’s taken away from other schools. And sure, you could say his academy uses the resources better. But he’s also taking away from some other kids who aren’t at his school. That’s fucked up.  It really angers me that he puts his name on it and acts as if it’s 100% his effort. “The LeBron James I Promise Academy” it’s so egotistical. Majority isn’t even paid for by him, and it’s not like he’s actually doing anything except giving money.  Don’t accuse me of being uninformed if you’re the one blindly bootlicking the billionaire.

"Fan subs are crazy.   I remember pre season Lakers sub hated Lebron for breaking up the young core (realistically that’s not just on him but of course he gets the blame) but now that they’re winning it’s ALL HAIL KING JAMES.    Fan stands for fanatic for a reason, they don’t use logic."
i can’t believe their were actual fans questioning whether a team led by Lebron James and AD were only winning games because of a shit schedule   like what are you trying to prove? Who are you trying to discredit?
It’s also why I feel goat conversations are so flawed. How do you possibly compare wilt chamberlain and lebron James?
"Lonzo was so hyped he didn't go #1...  tons of prospects were more hyped than Lonzo, all Lonzo had was a loudmouthed father  Off the top of my head Lebron James, Zion, Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, and KD were the top 5 most hyped picks in the last while. I'm probably forgetting someone though"
It had Lebron james in it so there was some excitement
Chris Paul  Michael Jordan  Larry Bird  LeBron James  Nikola Jokic
"People acting like most weren't skeptical of Luka and as if most teams don't get lucky with what talent blooms into stars and which don't. As a Wizard's fan, most people never expected Beal to be a Allstars let alone a Max player (lol). He is good enough to gone 2 in that class but. There were others in that class as well that been dimes. Otto Porter was another steal but nobody could predict how Giannis Antetokounmpo would have been to take a high pick on him. Yeah some teams fuck up but those usually small market teams with little to no free agent appeal and try to win the lottery based on actual hype and potential for star players because that's their only way to actually grow. Often getting lucky to land a LeBron James /Kobe or somebody on that level."
"lebron james and kevin garnett  not necesarrily the best fit but i wanted to throw the idea  peak james and peak garnett playing today would make a crazy defensive front court   add a 5 with a 3 pointer and that front court spacing, scoring, defending amd rebounding would be all time best"
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
Of course not. LeBron James is omnipotent
No. 8 out of shape 5’9” white guys from reddit aren’t beating LeBron James in a game of basketball and you can’t convince me otherwise.
Steve Nash on the Suns always had elite on/off numbers. Lebron James has never had a negative on/off. On/off one of the best raw stats. How a team performs when a player is added is one of the best stats there is.
"People already compare him to Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird. Maybe most overrated in /r/nba history."
"Its just a sign of more of the same shit from him. He doesn’t really help others though, he just acts like he does.  He’s made close to a billion dollars in his career. I can only find evidence of him donating his own money once ($2.5 million to Muhammad Ali Foundation), everything other than that has been through the LeBron James foundation (money he’s raised from other people). That’s good that he’s done something, but he acts as if he’s some sort of philanthropic leader. That’s just not true when you donate such a small percentage.  That’s not even mentioning his sham of a school. He puts his name on it, makes commercials about it, and acts like he’s saving the world with it by himself. It’s a FUCKING PUBLIC SCHOOL. That’s right, funded by Akron’s taxpayers. The LeBron James foundation (not all LeBron’s money) contributed $2 million to open the school, that’s it. It’s such a great idea and mission, that’s why it’s so frustrating to me that he only half-asses it, if that, and claims all of the credit.  Also, Nike recently released a new LeBron 17 “I Promise” edition. None of the proceeds go towards the academy.  On Nike’s site they say they made a one-time contribution to the school, I’m assuming that’s a part of the original $2 million. There’s no denying that’s fucked up to use those virtues to make money for yourself.  I don’t care if you don’t donate, but don’t pretend you’re a philanthropist if you don’t put your money where your mouth is."

"Yup 2.3 per game? Cause he is playing the point guard more. But he does post up to. He doesnt necessarily regressed.  &gt;Point is the post up is becoming more and more irrelevant every year  Because there are no great players playing in the post? If there's a great player that is a good post up player then everything will change. This league is a copy cat league. What teams see is successful, they copy. That's why you see teams shooting more threes.   LeBron isn't really a good post up player. He doesn't have great footwork. But he does post up because of his size.   &gt;It'd be stupid to advocate James Harden to post up  No it's not stupid. Him adding to his repertoire is stupid? Him conserving his energy and still being a threat to score is stupid? I don't think so."
"He barely posts up more than 2 times a game and his post up possessions have regressed in la.   Point is the post up is becoming more and more irrelevant every year. League-wide, even the guys that are good at it like a LeBron and Kawhi are doing it less. It'd be stupid to advocate James Harden to post up, especially unlike a Bron or kawhi he'd have very little positional advantage on anyone."
Even at the time people who downvoted him were pretty dumb. Giannis was a high pick for MVP in 2018-19 [only behind AD and Lebron in the preseason predictions](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2018-19-nba-mvp-odds-lebron-james-anthony-davis-open-as-favorites-but-giannis-antetokounmpo-is-close-behind/amp/)
Lebron james   He's top 5 but closer to 5 than 1   His accolades and stats say he's worse than Kareem and jordan   Simply accolades he's behind Russell and stats he's behind wilt highest up I can personally have him is 3
"&gt;Strawman after strawman.  I never said any player, if competitive enough can carry a team to the playoffs, a large amount of talent is obviously necessary. Otherwise you'd have guys like Patrick Beverley taking a team to the playoffs.  You seem to think that regardless of how much talent KAT's surrounded with his team won't ever be competitive because he doesn't want to win enough so clearly you're putting in a far heavier amount of emphasis on this so called ""wanting to win enough"" compared to talent.    &gt;The Jordan first three years arguement is fair, just not sure if it's relevant.  It's relevant because we know that Jordan was perhaps the most competitive player ever and his teams still failed to produce results due to talent.  Hi maybe having talent matters more than some arbitrary judgment of how much a player wants to win?  &gt;Skip used that criticism on Bron after the Cavs had already gone deep into the playoffs led by James. The only playoff appearance KAT has had was under Butler's leadership.  ""KAT can't lead a competitive team because he doesn't want to win enough""  ""Lebron can't win a title because he doesn't want to win enough"".  It's basically the same shitty argument that tries to blame the results of a complex team game onto the personality of one player and say ""oh because x player doesn't want to win his team can never accomplish y goal"".  I'd honestly respect your argument more if you say ""KAT can never lead a competitive team because he isn't a top 50 player"" or some shit like that."
"Glad you know when he's joking or not, ever listed to him speak on Kobe?   Bull in a China shop bs..  From ty lue.. ""He's so strong and so physical, when he goes to the basket, guys are bouncing off of him. Those are still fouls, but he doesn't get that call because he's so big and so strong and so physical."" he was speaking of lebron..

Also he was always nice as hell off the court..."
"google David West talking about Lebron James. It is like David West just came to the final realization that no matter how well he and his teeammates plays, and gives everything they have, there is one man that still exists on a higher level than that.      It is humbling. And these are guys that are already top 0.01% of their profession."
Y'all really act like jimmy Butler is lebron James. Dudes never made it out of the second round in the east and is somehow seen as the prototypical winner.
"Literally every commonly held opinion about the Lakers, kind of funny just how off base this sub was.  The best is this one from just before the off-season: [[Deveney] Celtics believe Rich Paul planted the story about Kyrie Leaving](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/aqkxci/deveney_celtics_believe_rich_paul_planted_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  Oh and this one from the David Griffin press tour: [[SI] David Griffin on LeBron: “I don’t think he’s the same animal anymore about winning.” Many in the NBA now suggest James harbors two priorities: enduring to team with his eldest son, Bronny, and one day owning a franchise](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cksqba/si_david_griffin_on_lebron_i_dont_think_hes_the/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_title)"
He is going nowhere    Rich Paul will immediately become a persona non grata around the NBA if he goes again LeBron James ‘s interests lol
"&gt; Our young guys need to learn how to play half court offense.  Luke is the worst coach for that tho lmao.. Las biggest issue was the complete lack of half court offense while he was there, their half court offense looked bad with Lebron fucking James.. You have to be a special kind of bad coach to accomplish that."
"You didn't read my post very well or you completely ignored the context. I'll share the chain with you so you understand.   &gt; Lotta Lakers jerseys in there and the regular season empty seats that are apparently high corp VIPs that only attend playoff games    &gt;   &gt; But if you’re going to attend a regular season game this is the game to attend. What corporate guy is passing up seeing Lebron James?    &gt;   &gt; The ones who don't care about basketball   So you go to playoff games, but not a game with LeBron James even though you don't care about basketball? Everyone knows who Bron is and 20 years from now 'I got to see Bron live' will be a really cool story to tell people. I know how corporate season tickets work, but what you said isn't applicable to context. Someone is still using the seats if they go to playoff games. Not sure what the rowdiness of a section has to do with whether or not a corporate guy attends a basketball game.  &gt; and at no point did I say that only poor people watch basketball. So, I don't know why you felt compelled to make it about that.   I said care, not just watch. Anyone can watch a game casually and barely care. I have family members who watch games just because there's nothing else to watch or because it's a family event and it's on. I was making the point that it's silly how this topic always immediately goes to 'corporate guys don't care about basketball' regardless of context. It's an illogical statement that people repeat because they hear it from other people."
Damn your team’s wing players can’t stop Lebron fucking James? Guess they suck then. Certified scrubs I tell you
George Bush does not care about Lebron James
LeBron James 2x All-Star.
"Who’s more athletic, Spud Webb or Lebron James?"
But if you’re going to attend a regular season game this is the game to attend. What corporate guy is passing up seeing Lebron James?

"LeBron James and dad dicking the life and soul out of an eastern teams home arena during the playoffs, name a more iconic duo"
LeBron James humbled to hear China hasn't erased his character from NBA 2K20.
1. Nick Nurse 2. Lebron James 3. Eric Spoelstra 4. Mike Budenholzer 5. Mike Malone  Honorable mention: Rick Carlisle.
Lebron James was undoubtedly a better player than rose that year. It’s such a shame that narrative plays such a huge role in MVP voting.
"Derrick Rose got like 95% of the first place votes that year. He was without a doubt the player that deserved the MVP. Offcource Lebron James was the best player but in vacuum for that season alone, Rose outperformed him.  Lebron mafia is trying to rewrite history both with Rose and Harden MVP while at the time there was no doubt who was getting them"
"I think Lebron was still  the best player but he didn't have the narrative on his side to win MVP. When Lebron joined Miami they were expected to challenge the 1996 Bulls 72-10 WL record and instead they only won 57 games. James was still the best player but he winning the MVP in a *disappointing* regular season.      **EDIT:** Rose still had an incredible season but he definitely had more of a story going for him by being the face of a team that was exceeding all expectations. I also think the 2011 Bulls were an underrated defensive team which was a bigger reason for their success than Rose's elite play. Guys like Deng, Noah and Taj were really good on that end."
&gt;Cleaning the glass has him as a 94th percentile guy on offense and a 13th percentile guy on defense. In all he's in the 72nd percentile on overall impact.  &gt;ESPN RPM has him as #6 on offensive impact and #421 in defensive impact. #17 overall.  I was exaggerating a little bit. On the criteria when comparing it to stars his impact is very mediocre. He isn't sophomore year Lebron. He isn't Steve Nash on the Suns. He isn't James Harden. He is 17th overall in one stat and not even in the top quarterile in another stat (cleaning the glass).
"I remember when Houston was running that ad back then that James Harden is the new King James, uuuuh no, it's still LeBron"
"Are you joking or something? Lakers one flaw is secondary ball handling, and both BI and Lonzo solve that. Lonzo shoots better than Bradley, and Ingram shoots better than danny green, both play similar positions. The only argument against this is BI is a high usage type guy that'll ruin movement based on ball sticking.  Lakers were 3rd in the west in December before it went to shit with much worse coaching and team composition. And lonzo and bi are one year better now.  The pelicans record shows it because they don't have LeBron James lmfao"
"You guys are out of your mind if you don't think Silver wants LeBron fucking James on every national TV from now until eternity.  The reason they're pushing new stars is because they don't want to be fucked when LeBron actually walks away. But they're more than happy to keep riding the Bron train as long as it's making them money, and LeBron is still the most popular player in the league by a long shot."
"His last tweet is him congratulating LeBron James for passing him for 3rd on the all time scoring list after playing in his home town.  The chills man, this was literally hours ago. So fucking sad."
"All the news is still about lebron James passing his scoring, it’s taking awhile for the news to spread. Tragic for him to die so young"
"This literally happens hours after congratulating LeBron James for passing him for 3rd on the all time scoring list, this is insane. :("
"Just a day after LeBron James passed him for #3 scorer of all time. Cruel, twisted fate.   I hope his wife and his daughters weren't on board of the helicopter.  &amp;#x200B;  R.I.P. Kobe Bryant."
Can't imagine how LeBron James must be feeling today. RIP Kobe
"Wow...I was just thinking earlier this morning about what it would have been like if Lebron James and Kobe had played together on the Lakers at the same time, and how many rings they could have won...R.I.P."
"This is unreal. I can't believe it.  Never much of a basketball fan, but Kobe Bryant was one of the all-time greatest athletes in any sport. LeBron James just was singing his praises as one of the greatest scorers ever. He is also a father and a husband. He will be missed.  Rest in Peace."
Damn man if it’s true its fucking crazy sad. His last tweet was him congratulating Lebron James.  https://twitter.com/kobebryant/status/1221276426164269056?s=21
"Bad headline, but here is the actual passage they aggregated from  &gt;“The Lakers’ glorious history transcends even Bryant, who played each of his 20 seasons, scored all of his points and won his five titles with the Lakers,” wrote Vardon. “Kobe is the franchise’s standard-bearer until someone takes it from him. James certainly didn’t do it last year, with his injury that derailed his own season, his attitude that showcased indifference toward the LA fans and to the Lakers failing to make the playoffs. As the Lakers’ offseason began, and the team was looking for a coach, there was an internal struggle in the front office with a faction loyal to Bryant that did not want to cede power to James. It’s partially how the Lakers ended up with [Frank] Vogel instead of Tyronn Lue — LeBron’s coach from the Cavs.”  From Vardon on the Athletic.   Basically, they don't want to hand over more power and decision making to LeBron. Not sure exactly how that relates to Kobe though, since he's not involved, but I guess they don't think he's earned the same power as Kobe."
"LeGM : Ah shit, here we go again..  LeBron Raymone James: Awww yisss. Here we fuckin go."
I never said the team is better without Luka. I always said if Mavs didn't have Luka but another average PG instead they would be like an 8th seed team. Kinda like the Nets or Clippers of last year where they had 42-46 wins and was 8ish seed but had no stars. Luka elevates the Mavs to about a 6th seed. People think that Luka is doing a sophomore year Lebron James style carrying of the team and willing the Mavs to the 6th seed when they are a bad lottery team but this just isn't the case since Bench have top 5 bench and elite head coach.
LeBron James
I’m starting to think this Lebron James guy is kinda good. An uncut gem sorta fella.
"Other than Giannis and Luka...  James Harden has at least another 3 top seasons left in the tank so don't count him out;  Trae Young if he gets moved to a better team (or Atlanta begin a top team in the east somehow);  Anthony Davis if he can lead the Lakers when Lebron will start decline seriously or when is contract with the Lakers ends (it can be the same time I think);  Zion Williamson if he can stay healthy and this Pelicans core stay togheter (and healthy);  As outsiders that can maybe snatch one I have Kirye, Booker and BI (but its crazy unlikely tho)"
"*watches LeBron James' kid play against pre-teens*  *has never seen a WNBA game*  ""lol I just like watching the highest quality basketball"""
&gt; It’s highly improbable he stays at this level for anything more than the next year  LeBron spends [$1.5million/year](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/how-lebron-james-spends-money-body-care-2018-7) to take care of his body.
A 50 year old LeBron James comes off the bench for the first time in the season just to play in the finals
"You can't have possibly saw LeBron James playing in his first stint on Cleveland or in Miami and say that he hasn't slow down  At his peak, he was so overwhelming physically that it was absolutely ridiculous. He could keep up with point guards in the perimeter, outmuscle any forward and be strong and tall enough that he could guard centers.  You can clearly see the slowing down on defense, but especially when he has to defend guards. The first time it hit me that he wasn't the same was when Oladipo blew past him in a playoff game and he almost got back, but wasn't fast enough and ended up goaltending the shot.  Back in his heyday he could keep up with Prime D-Rose and John Wall, which is something he's absolutely incapable of today."
"People said the same about Kobe up until he got obliterated by injuries.  LeBron is not yet at unprecedented territory, as Kobe was First Team All-NBA in his 17th year and had similar mileage to his body. Karl Malone also had a pretty decent 18th year averaging 21/8/5.  LeBron is not exactly the same as he was in 2013 or 2016, but he's so great he still one of the best (the same way Kobe was in 2013).  I would say he has this year and the next as an All-NBA caliber player without injuries, but anything after that? I wouldn't bet even on LeBron James.  Players have made First team All-NBA in their 17th year, players have even made All-NBA in their 18th year, but in their 19th year or after? Never."

"Michael Jordan has more 50+ point games in his 179 game playoff career than Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Dwayne Wade, Larry Bird, Kevin Durant, Domnique Wilkins, Wilt Chamberlain, James Harden combined in 1,286 playoff games"
"Gonna post the stuff I been posting now that people are finally waking up to the fact Ben Simmons is one of the best players in the NBA.   We all know Ben Simmons leads the league in deflections and steals. Some other facts:     1. Ben  Simmons is one of only two players in the entire history of the NBA to  guard positions 1-5 more than 10% of the time and hold every single  position below their point per 100 possession averages. In today's  league guarding multiple positions is more important than ever because  of the popularity of switching to free up shooters/mismatches. This  skill is the most valuable it's ever been and Ben Simmons is the best  player in the history of the NBA at this skill (Gary Payton is the other  who also did it though on lower volume). 2. According to [backpicks.com](https://backpicks.com/)  which is the stat resource I pay for, Ben Taylor's Thinking Basketball  resource: Ben Simmons is top 25 all time in overall passer rating. This  accounts for a ridiculous amount of different factors and their analysis  are usually spot on/trustworthy. Backpicks has him rated as the 7th  best player in the league this season, now I think that's a bit generous  perhaps but he's the only player in the top 10 whose box plus minus is  more defense than it is offense, their formulas account for things like  opponent % FG  etc. 3. Currently,  he's 3rd in points created off of assists trailing only Luka and Lebron  James this season and he's 1st in 3 pt assists despite having worse 3  point% shooting teammates than Luka/Lebron. This is elite company and  Ben Simmons has all time rated court vision both offensively and  defensively. Offensive vision and defensive prowess are two of the most  valuable weapons a player can have. At an elite level, these along with  basketball IQ are the rarest skills. 4. Ben  Simmons burst/speed is currently arguably the best in the league as  Wesbtrook ages. He's fast and he's the best player in transition offense  in the NBA currently. He is a one man transition unit and this adds an  entire component to any offense he joins. He doesn't fit very well with  slow players which is why playing with Horford and Embiid definitely can  be a negative to him sometimes. 5. Ben  Simmons is 23 years old with a case for the most versatile defensive  guard ever, a top 25 all time passer, an elite transition player, he's  proven elite defense that is even better against good players (see stats  on him vs. Kawhi 7 game). His recent 30 point triple double is one of  the most efficient triple doubles of all time on 86% FG, it only  compares to efficient triple doubles by Centers like Jokic and Shaq. I  haven't looked this one up so I won't state it but I would not be  surprised if I looked into it and it was the most efficient 30 pt triple  double of any guard not named MJ. He's a hard worker and is not injury  prone with an elite motor. He's building on the kind of things you  build on to go from great to all time great from age 23-27/29 and it's  very likely we look back on his career to find a man who has 8 all star  appearances, multiple titles, multiple all defensive NBA teams, and a  case for the best defensive guard of the modern era."
"The crazy thing is Stockton has over 6K more assists than LeBron in nearly the same amount of minutes. Not a shot at James, he’s clearly an elite passer and probably the best all time from the forward position but Stocktons assists number will probably never get broken"
"Bro how in the fuck did you manage to resist including the tiny little detail of LEBRON JAMES being the quote?? You left Karma on the table, my man."
in french lebron means james according to translate so he is james james.
"Lol yea I should feel bad for hating LeBron ""I need chinese money"" bitch ass james"
"He is LeBron James. He can play at this level 3 more years and then slowing down quietly. Averaging 25 ppg and 11 ast sounds crazy, but he is coasting. I expect 30 ppg and 10 ast in playoffs."
LeBron James is 137 years old. 137 years old!
"Nothing big but he's the closest thing to one feeding drama.  Lebron's behavior last season? What are you talking about? He was quiet and waited for Ad.  You don't get to speak for us. The biggest addition to the Lakers was Lebron James, the best player in the league, and he brought in Ad and KCP our 2nd and 3rd best players. Our great team chemistry comes from Lebron and Ad liking each other and being friends, but also being able to hold each other accountable and push each other."
"How sweet would it be to sayc, “I threw lebron James an alley oop!”"
"Philly fans have seen Lebron score more points than Lakers fans.  Just an Eastern Conference thang  If he did it in Toronto, Raps fans would’ve ruptured his ear drums with our cheers because that’s how much we hate-respect King James in the North.    Because we know our Raps would’ve never won the chip without Lebron James annually destroying our playoff dreams for a straight decade.  Ntm he was usually nice enough not to sweep us.    Compare that to Jordan giving us that one regular season home game win in 96, or Kobe dropping 81, those beatings got nothing on Tyrannical James"
"Lol it's the regular season. We have LeBron motherfucking James. Until he loses in the playoffs I'm gonna believe in that dude. You think this shit fazes him? It's just another game to him. Lost in all our losses, is the fact that this remains as Lebby's best team ever in his career, with arguably his best teammate ever, and the best defense ever.  No teams is gonna beat Lebby, AD and the rest of the Lakers in a 7-game series. I willing to bet on that (as long as we stay healthy of course. That's always the big variable)."

BEN SIMMONS OUTPLAYED LEBRON JAMES. TOP 3 PG IN THE LEAGUE TODAY DONT @ ME
&gt; You're straight up comparing Luka  I am? Dude this whole subbreddit is on a daily basis comparing him to MJ and Lebron James and people saying that even if Ayton turns into Patrick Ewing or David Robinson he is a bust compared to Luka.
Lakers lose in five or six to the Clippers.   They get exposed by teams that can defend 35 year-old LeBron James and the only other offensive threat in Anthony Davis.   Fakest 1 seed I've seen in a long while.
&gt; as he passes LeBron James for number 3 on the all time scoring list!   Congrats Kobe! Keep going!
"the greatest player in the NBA, and LeBron James"
"&gt;How is that not a T on lebron for taunting? Refs have money on lakers.  Because LeBron James wasn't really even taunting a player in a demeaning way, he froze his stance for a moment then ran back to the other side of the court lol"
definitely yes  its lebron fucking james

"I really think you are underestimating how much Instagram, Twitter, and Social media in general has made todays players more popular. I garuntee you any kid in London knows LEBROOOON JAMES just from the stupid meme that one kid did.  I would say Kobe was as popular as Jordan as well. I don't know if you're just a giant Jordan stan...or making poor arguments to bump up the relevance of your question. To say neither Lebron or Kobe are as popular as Jordan is pretty outrageous."
Back in 2015 my top 5 in 5 years was:  1. LeBron    2. Headband LeBron   3. LeBron with a sore back   4. LeBron with a little cold but not too bad   5. LeBron “Bronny” James Jr.
So you don’t think people around the world know who Lebron James is regardless of whether or not they like basketball?!? The dude was in a movie with Amy Schumer lol
"&gt;Reynolds was excited about the idea, but when they gathered in the locker room and he saw players such as LeBron James and Kyrie Irving sitting there, he became a bit nervous. What if they didn’t like it? What if they wanted to just focus on the game?  &gt;Then the tape rolled, and there were howls and smiles everywhere. “The players really appreciated it,” Celtics assistant coach Jay Larranaga said. “LeBron spoke up right away and said, ‘That’s the coolest thing anyone’s ever done in all my years of being an All-Star.’ ”  LeBro"
"Lebron had a tons of dangerous jumps that could've ended in a terrible injury  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-kolNcY53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-kolNcY53s)  &amp;#x200B;  this one vs wizards was damn scary and I bet most of players would've ruined their knees after such movement, with all those pounds on that one knee.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDZSWbaP3FE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDZSWbaP3FE)  &amp;#x200B;  As I mentioned in a comment a little while ago, Lebron have super strong ankles and as Eddie House mentioned when he played with him in miami, he figured out James had ankles bigger than House's knees."
"Perhaps a more obscure choice, but [Jerry West's Grizzlies drafting LeBron in '03](https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2014/05/20/2003-nba-lottery-lebron-james-memphis-grizzlies) takes the cake for me"
"1) No, a modern Knicks 3 peat would not pass Jordan in popularity.   2) Talent and success does not result in same level of popularity. And no, Lebron is not on the same level of popularity that Michael Jordan was.   3) Your last sentence actually helps prove my point. James Harden and Curry are really popular in China and they're American. Now imagine if a Chinese superstar was successful in the NBA. The Chinese support would be even more immense."
"You don’t think a modern Knicks 3 peat would pass Jordan in popularity? Jordan is so popular because of his talent and success, if another player (of any ethnicity) had the same level of talent and success then they would have the same level of popularity... Lebron is already on that level and he hasn’t had half of Jordan’s finals success, so why wouldn’t someone who actually did 3 peat have that kind of popularity? Why do they need to be Chinese? I get that China has more people than Iceland and a Chinese player would be popular in China, but aren’t James Harden and Steph Curry already popular as fuck in China?"
Your team and franchise is a fucking joke. Thank the fact that Gloria James gave birth to her child in the state of Ohio. LeBron falling into your lap in the draft and him returning because he’s from the area is the only reason you guys have been relevant. Every non LeBron cavs season has been a joke since the early 90s
HE IS THE DEFENDING MVP AND BEST LEBRON JAMES TWICE! HE IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE NBA

- W - W - W - W - W - W - LeBron James
LeBron James
LeBron James has more triple doubles in the Finals (10 in 49 Finals games) than Kawhi does in his entire career (502 games).
You’re absolutely right he’s not Steve Nash. He’s LeBron James.
"I don't know if people have ever heard of him but this guy named Russell Westbrook plays pretty good when James Harden isn't on the court. Also, Anthony Davis is a pretty good player of basketball behind LeBron James.   More of what you are looking for: Kristaps is out of the limelight because of the Doncic and Carlise show but he still has a game that could be built around as the 1st option. Still haven't seen a clear vision of a team built around him but he still deserves one."
"Why pointing out his poor attributes is considered as hate? IMO his main problem that he wants to be perceived like Lebron, Kd and Steph and this sends him on a path to shoot threes and chase triple doubles and records.   When he plays with the flow of the game and doesn't shoot threes - he is a beast. Its no coinsendence that his best games are recently with him shooting 1 three per game. When he shoots 20% on 6 attemps, his confidence dips and hurts his game.  Harden and Westbrook could make it work, only if they understand that MVP's and records are not the things they want. Recent poor showings of Harden can be a blessing for James"
"IMO LeBron not getting more MVPs is basically solely due to three things:  1. The narrative that he coasts through the regular season. There’s some evidence to this, as he basically looks like a totally different player in the playoffs and he absolutely “sons” entire cities.  2. His decline in defense from Miami days. Even when he keeps his team afloat offensively, besides this year it has been a while since people have even commended his defense, and the drop off from his MVP years in Miami is large.   These two are two faces of a similar coin. People don’t judge LeBron against the competition. They judge him against his former self *and* the competition.  3. He does not take out the “do it yourself” kit that often and doesn’t have as many big scoring nights as every other MVP. This has been a knock on James pretty much since he dropped from the only option in Cleveland. He passes too much, and manages the game like a point guard or an older QB for casual fans. His consistency is in all aspects of the game is unappreciated because he lacks the razzle dazzle of a 50 or 60 point game here and there.  In the end I’m not sure it matters to the average viewer much if LeBron got All Star, 1st Team All NBA, and MVP but still lost in the Finals. He is at this point just chasing the all-time lists and number of championships. When the MVP is sitting at home in June, they weren’t the MVP."
"you really thing a ""turned it on"" kawhi is better than a ""turned it on"" Steph curry, Lebron James, Kevin Durant????"
"Maybe it’s alphabetical.   James, LeBron  Jordan, Michael"
"In a world filled with Lebron James’ free agency and building super teams every stop, than you have players like dame who are good just being a great player in a small market. No complaints just wants to play."
My guy James needs to take one of those LeBron January vacations cuz this is just brutal   But also Russ is my daddy
I’d prefer lebron james tbh
"That’s great , KD came into the league a killer , had 4 scoring titles and finished second in MVP for half a decade to prime Lebron James ."
"Yes, MJ fucked Gloria James when she was 15 and then left her. Then she gave birth to Lebron James a year later."
Lebron literally calls himself KING James lol
"James Naismith had more impact on the game of basketball than anyone, literally infinitely more impact than Jordan or Lebron. so I don't think that's a good criterion for judging players lol"
"&gt;I mean, its pretty simple: LeBron James has the better single accolade, which is the 2016 ring. Coming back from down 3-1 against a 73 win team while leading both teams in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks is just unreal.    Kyrie was the 2nd leading scorer and was the 2nd best player of that finals series, averaging 27/4/4/2. Draymond was suspended for a game while Bogut, their best rim protectors and anchor got injured...   &gt;It tops any single accolade of Jordans, and if people value peak over total accolades, its pretty easy to see a solid argument for LeBron.   Jordan beat a 60 win Orlando Magic team with Shaq, Penny Hardaway, Horace Grant and Dennis Scott in the conference finals while proceeding to beat a 64 win Supersonic with DPOY Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Detlef Schrempf and Hershey Hawkins. While having a 72-10 record   Jordan averaged 31/7/11 in the 91 finals.  Jordan averaged 41/9/6 in the 93 finals.  Stop it...   &gt; Whether or not you agree with the argument is another thing, but its not a difficult argument to understand and doesn't require any mental gymnastics.   It is a matter of mental gymnastics. Winning 1 championship against a 73 win team doesn't compare to 6 hard earned championships, no matter what.  Especially if one of your finals losses include you getting out-played by a 33 year old roleplayer.   &gt;Both James and Jordan have great GOAT-tier resumes. Its about whether you value a perfect finals record, or the best finals win of all time.  Or having more MVPs, Finals MVPs, more rings, more All Defensive selections, a DPOY, 10 scoring titles and the better peak..."
"That's your definition of greatest though.   We decide on the legacy that makes them the greatest, legacy isn't some fixed thing defined by an authority.   Someone might think that being the best basketball player makes someone the greatest basketball player (which when said like that sounds pretty sensible), and then they believe that Lebron James (or someone else) is better at basketball than Jordan was.  It's really not that far fetched"

"I don't know about Bam being ""miles"" better playmaker than Sabonis.  The offense runs through Sabonis while he's on the floor.  Playmakinng is another area they are very close.  Check out this article by the Ringer which shows just how close they are in terms of playmaking;  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/1/24/21079412/points-creation-giannis-antetokounmpo-luka-doncic-lebron-james"
"Lmao no one is going to a shitty College of Akron for 4 years, it's clearly a trap.  Also:   &gt; The I Promise School, which was opened by the LeBron James Family Foundation and Akron Public Schools, will reportedly eventually cost taxpayers approximately $8 million per year.   According to the Plain Dealer's Patrick O'Donnell, that figure will be ""covered mostly by shifting students, teachers and money from other schools.""  That's not just taxpayer's money."
"The way he talks about Lowry makes it sound like he is the 2nd coming of Lebron James. Lowry is a solid guard. Very smart player. All Star was always about the players having the BEST season.  It's not a life time award. It's not based on your potential. It's about what YOU HAVE done the first half of the season.  Lowry hasn't done enough to be an All Star guard. Beal has. NO ONE outside of Lebron James in the last 17 years has been able to bring their team to contention BY THEMSELVES.  You dont need all stars with you, but you need a well build team. Beal has never played on a well built team. We cant penalize him for it."
He's time traveling Lebron James. Like Old Man Logan.
"For sure.   &gt;James' midseason case for this being a real MVP race boils down to this: The Lakers look like the best team in the West when LeBron is on the court, and they look like a lottery team when he's not.  That makes him the MVP of the Lakers, but not the league. In fact, the entire article is based on how James is propping up the Lakers and has been great in the past, but that really doesn't address the reality that Giannis is destroying everyone"
"What puts LeBron ahead of Bird is LeBron's durability. LeBron has been playing on this level for a little longer than a decade. Bird couldn't play on that level after 1987-88 season.   But peak to peak, it's a coin toss. Bird was just as good as James.      Resume is being about greater. A player can be that good without being that great."
"Yes. Download the Calm app now, endorsed by LeBron James... :/"
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2019-10-07/lakers-head-to-china-after-big-preseason-win-over-warriors%3f_amp=true  First off, sorry for the mobile link.  Second, it appears that we were both somewhat mistaken. The Lakers flew to China on the 8th, altough this was still ""amidst controversy"", with coaches being asked questions and videos of riots and brutality surfacing, so I don't see how it changes much. It's not as if LeBron made the final decision on if they would go. They were still forced to shut down media events (directions from the Chinese government originally) and take extra precautions. I'm not claiming that LeBron felt unsafe at the time of making those comments. It was the day after returning to the States following what may have been the two most uncomfortable games of his career. I think that he was frustrated with the situation.  Third, don't put words into my mouth. I never once said that LeBron should have publicly criticized Morey. My point was that LeBron didn't say that Morey was uneducated about the Chinese political situation. He makes that clear in the full quotation that he thinks Morey did not consider the consequences, which has to be true. He deleted the tweet how long after? At no point does he actually critique Morey's political views, only the way that he went about it. I'm pretty sure Morey regrets it, too. He is still employed, however, he lost the Rockets like $20 million, didn't he? He didn't have to travel to China four days afterward like James did. I'm not saying that I'm pro-China, but Morey is one of the faces of ""The China Team"" in an organization in a capitalist country with massive profits coming in from deals with China. Don't you think that it's at least a little bit stupid (or uneducated) and unprofessional to use your social media account (likely riddled with NBA-related ""work tweets"" and Chinese fans as well) to publicly criticize the most sensitive government in the world - after NK - four days before teams leave for their annual China games?  But unless he wanted to be fired and try to sue the league or something, I don't see what else he expected to happen. It's nice that he cares I guess, but realistically the tweet was about as effective as facebook likes and prayers for poor or dying kids. It did raise lots of awareness in the end, but clearly he didn't expect it to blow up like that. Morey didn't think it through, because obviously if it were to reach a wide audience then it would creatce controversy, but if it didn't then it had little point. Essentially high risk, little-to-no reward. Maybe it was all a plan from the begnning to gain attention and he didn't care about the wellbeing of players, his job, or the league's pockets, but that seems unlikely. And to be fair, LeBron's comments may have even brought more attention to the situation, even if they were stupid. I don't really see how siding with Morey openly would hurt China and help HK anyway."
This is ridiculous. Anthony Davis isn’t even close to LeBron James and quite frankly anybody who is watching these games sees that. This teams offense goes to shit without LeBron James and no matter if AD is playing or not as long as they have LeBron they are gonna be elite. I also believe (not 100% sure) that all the lineup data supports.
Imagine comparing LeBron James to Trae Young. I understand Bucks fans are touchy when it comes to Giannis but this comment is really something else.
"“LeBron James is the most valuable player in the league because Rondo and Caruso are shit backup ball handlers”  If your case for MVP is built on what happens when you’re not playing, it’s a bad case."
Obviously. He's LeBron James.
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-college-scholarship-school-cost-100-million-2018-7%3famp  Sorry if the link is weird, I'm on mobile.  What I said was technically false I suppose, but he has pledged to send 2300 kids to college if they qualify, which would cost at least $105 million alone. Based on the I Promise School's success so far, I think that many will. I don't know much about his separate program separate from the I Promise school tbh, but it seems like he is giving them every tool possible to succeed and get that scholarship.  Additionally, the calculations done were with the cost of tuition in fees in 2018. 2021 is the first round of scholarships that he will pay for. With the perpetually rising costs of tuition in North America, his foundation could end up paying out well over 100 million even if only, say, 2000 qualify. This is pure conjecture on my part (cannot find any info on this one way or the other), but I'm guessing that the vast majority of that money comes from James himself. Combine this with his numerous smaller donations over the years and surely he will soon be over 100 million donated. And then he's done tbings like The Decision, which wasn't his money, but he directly helped to raise $2.5 million for charity at one of the worst moments of his career.  And it's more like he focuses on helping those who are in the situation he once was in. If he only does things without the risk of losing money, why pledge to send 2300 kids to college? Thats guaranteed money gone."

TRAVIS SCOTT FT LEBRON JAMES: LEBRONTO MODE
"this guy thinks if you handle the ball and play make then you should be listed as a point guard... lmao   Just because you do things that a stereotypical point guard does, doesn't mean you're a point guard...  LeBron isn't a PG, Jokic isn't a PG, Kawhi isn't a PG, James Harden isn't a PG... but all these guys do things for their teams that the PG is supposed to do, that doesn't mean they're playing point guard for their teams. LeBron is literally the reason Point-Forward is such a common phrase nowadays, because he's assuming the role of point guard while NOT being a guard. If you wanna say Jimmy is a Point-Forward, I'm fine with that, but he's not playing SG for the Heat.   Let's not ignore this point, it's not about what position you or I think he's playing.. what position does **his own team** say that he is playing? Do the Heat call him a guard? No, so why should I?"
"Maybe. But framed another way it gave us the greatest villains the league has ever seen. I'm even grateful for that, and also not biased at all.  https://i0.wp.com/www.hoopsrambler.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lebron-james-in-a-mask-under-the-red-light.jpg?resize=638%2C368"

"Of course they are probably superstars in those countries, and those countries have a lot less stars relatively speaking compared to America.  To me there have only been a handful of superstars in history. To name a few, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Shaquille Oneal, Yao Ming, Lebron James, etc. There's definitely more but I think these players transcendent basketball and time."
"They dont take it seriously because the fam vote makes no sense...  How does Lebron have 4 mil votes and James Harden only 2 million? Your ballot HAS to include 2 back court and 3 front court...  Anyone that voted for Bron and DIDNT vote for Harde , doesnt know basketball. In the West, this has been one of the most clear cut years in NBA history.  2 mil ppl thought Lebron is a starter, but Harden isnt... man please"
"LMAO how is this being upvoted, you’re telling me LeBron James rn wouldn’t want Kyrie on his team? That’s ridiculous"
Superb tribute from LeBron James.
"They had James Harden. If the Lakers had played against the Suns instead, and AD or LeBron was out, people would be expecting for them to win."
"Yes, 2016 and 2017, I just used the year that represents the end of the season because that’s when the playoffs of that season happen.   &gt;Also the 27 threes was the whole rockets team, not just harden.  This is a good point. But because of James Hardens reputation, people hold him accountable for his whole team.   Think of how many people you still see on IG and YouTube comments that hate on Lebron for getting sweeped in 2018 finals. He was averaging 34/8.5/10 and had a 51 point game in game 1. There’s no denying he was playing excellent basketball. But yet he received a lot of criticism after the fact.  That’s just how high the standard is raised for superstars."
"""Lebron James is only 2 for 21 on sky hooks tonight as he continues to chase Kareem. Inbound to James at the top of the key, spins for the fadea...way...sky hook? No good. Yet another ill-advised sky hook by Lebron."""

"&gt; Former Cavs general manager David Griffin recalls overhearing LeBron coaching the Raps during a game last season on how to properly execute one of theirs sets.  &gt; Per The Ringer:  &gt; “I was in the gym when I watched him on the floor against Toronto tell Patrick Patterson where he was supposed to go on the play they had called out of a timeout late in the fourth quarter,” Griffin said.  &gt; “He was like ‘no Pat, you’re supposed to stand over there and set a pin down for DeMar (DeRozan) over here.'”  https://www.slamonline.com/nba/lebron-james-told-raptors-run-plays-game/"

Maybe this disgruntled Heat fan just found out he still loves Bron? Who knows, I'll never admit it."
Jayson Tatum/LeBron James
McCaw is as good a lebron James.
Media's hate for Harden never ceases to amaze me.  James Harden below Jayson Tatum on the MVP ladder when averaging 35-7-7 on 62% TS jeeeeesus.  He should be right around Lebron
Lakers official Twitter account posts a video of LeBron James doing a tribute dunk to Kobe Bryant after his tragic passing two weeks ago?  Perfect time to enforce the minimum highlight quality rules.
"In the same way LeBron James could suddenly request a trade to the Bulls, yes, but in any sort of sensical  and reasonably possible scenario, obviously not   Why do you think it can realistically happen?"
"Lebron James is among the highest iq players ever. Cp3 is also a very high iq player. You can’t point to numbers and say one is better at something like passing than the other. I will say this season cp3’s success deserves a lot of praise. Like, not saying this thunder team is that comparable to last year’s laker squad, or that this is a necessarily fair comparison, but i can’t help but think that cp3 would have made been able to do a lot more with that Lonzo, Ingram team the lakers had last year then lebron did."
Risky as hell dude. You are literally giving up the ball. If that doesn't work and your name isn't LeBron James your ass is gonna be riding the bench for a long time.
"No, you doughnut. I'm saying Dame, Jokic and Embiid had better seasons than Lebron James last year."
You’re actually gonna say you’d rather have jokic Embiid or dame than Lebron last year? I’m a huge sixers fan but embiid is no fucking Lebron james. Lebron averaged 27/8/8 last year.
Lebron has been traded to the Hornets and IT is the Rockets new starting center. Masai has been traded to the Knicks for 5 cassettes of James Dolan’s band and a bag of cool ranch Doritos.
Here are my pitches that I took two minutes to come up with.  1)  Mr H.O.R.S.E - a bunch of disgruntled programmers team up for a techno heist against Daryl Morey and the Rockets that is centered on erasing every basketball analytical database in existence.  2) The Good Team - A generational rookie gets drafted onto the Sacramento Kings where he naively believes that they're rebuilding into a team for the future only to discover that the Kings are tanking... forever! Rest of the show deals with a rookie singlehandedly trying to build the team's FO/Culture/Team from scratch  3) Dear Tall People - This follows a youtube channel of an outspoken and talented street baller who's only obstacle to making it pro was his lack of height. This fella and his short brethren travel the country embarassing long bois on the court.  4) Westworld - An animated adult sci-fi basketball comedy where in the future every player in the league is a different clone/mutation of Russell Westbrook.  5) Toronsparent - It follows the trials and tribulations of Lebron James as he attempts to raise his newly adopted Canadian family in a world not much suited for a busy working father.
"Bro if there was an injury, LeBron ""I broke my hand"" James would have used it. He choked it's that simple. You can argue he was rusty but plenty of players bounce back faster."
https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/05/07/david-fizdale-reportedly-to-marc-gasol-i-get-it-you-want-gregg-popovich-and-i-want-lebron-james/  Dude literally didn't know who the fuck he was talking to like that.

"The load management is definitely an important factor to take in, I won't argue that. My take is this: the Lakers and the Clippers are both potential championship teams. The thing that gives the Lakers that potential is LeBron James and the way he utilizes his partnership with Anthony Davis. Meanwhile, the thing that gives the Clippers that potential is Kawhi Leonard and the way he utilizes *Kawhi Leonard*. The Clippers undoubtedly have a strong team behind Kawhi, but when the chips are down he's ultimately the reason they're contending. It's not that LeBron isn't essential (it's clear that he is), it's just that in his case it's a two man job and he's been open about being the supportive player of that duo. On top of that, Kawhi *is* outscoring both Lakers while also continuing to dominate on defense.   Both players are incredible, I won't badmouth either one and if LeBron winds up with 1st team or even MVP it'll be well deserved. I just think that Kawhi plays a bigger role on his team, and their successes are very similar."
"""The Spurs won a title in the 2000s?""  ""Not just ONE title, sonny boy. THREE! I seen it with my own two eyes! They beat LeBron James in 4 games. The Pistons took em seven, I tell ya!"""
"1st team: G: James Harden G: Luka Doncic F: LeBron James F: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Nikola Jokic  2nd team: G: Damian Lillard G: Russell Westbrook  F: Kawhi Leonard F: Anthony Davis  C: Rudy Gobert  3rd team: G: Trae Young G: Donovan Mitchell F: Khris Middleton  F: Pascal Siakam C: Bam Adebayo   I believe third team is the trickiest. You have guys with great stats like Booker, Beal, Trae, and Lavine, but their team record is not good. Then you have players like Kemba, Lowry, and Mitchell who are also putting up good numbers,  and their teams are winning, but players like Trae, Booker, and Beal have superior stats.   It’s a toss up, but I think Trae deserves it despite his team record. 29/5/9 with good efficiency. Mitchell is also putting up 25/4/4 on good efficiency with a winning team, so he has a good argument as well.  Then the center position is wide open. If Embiid plays better, he may have an argument over Adebayo.  Forward spot is a toss up between Ingram, Middleton, Tatum, and Butler. All have legitimate cases."
"I don't see how you could put Kawhi over Bron for 1st team. Kawhi is on track to miss about a quarter of his teams games this season. Bron has only missed 2 of his teams 50 games. Add that in with the fact that Kawhi is averaging only 2 more points, and 5 less assists than Bron, and Bron's defense actually being good this year (even though its still worse than Kawhi's) and you just can't argue that 75% of Kawhi Leonard has been more valuable than LeBron James so far this season"

"because i was comparing him to every player in the league.  &gt; 56TS for a player with &gt;30USG is pretty good  Westbrook over the season is at a 52.7% TS, which makes him literally the least efficient player with &gt;30% USG. obviously Steph and Dion have barely played this season, but they fit the criteria too.  |||||Crit|Crit|Tota| |-:|:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|Season|Tm|USG%|TS%|G| |1|Damian Lillard|2019-20|POR|30.5|.623|50| |2|James Harden|2019-20|HOU|36.6|.617|48| |3|Giannis Antetokounmpo|2019-20|MIL|37.9|.611|47| |4|Trae Young|2019-20|ATL|34.9|.598|47| |5|Kyrie Irving|2019-20|BRK|32.5|.595|20| |6|Luka Doni|2019-20|DAL|37.2|.589|43| |7|Paul George|2019-20|LAC|30.8|.586|30| |8|Joel Embiid|2019-20|PHI|31.8|.583|36| |9|Kawhi Leonard|2019-20|LAC|33.9|.579|39| |10|Bradley Beal|2019-20|WAS|33.2|.577|42| |11|LeBron James|2019-20|LAL|31.3|.572|48| |12|Zach LaVine|2019-20|CHI|31.4|.564|53| |13|Derrick Rose|2019-20|DET|30.9|.564|44| |14|DAngelo Russell|2019-20|GSW|32.1|.558|33| |15|Donovan Mitchell|2019-20|UTA|31.2|.558|49| |16|Stephen Curry|2019-20|GSW|33.8|.548|4| |17|Spencer Dinwiddie|2019-20|BRK|30.1|.539|50| |18|Dion Waiters|2019-20|MIA|31.0|.530|3| |19|Russell Westbrook|2019-20|HOU|33.9|.527|43|"

They have fucking LeBron James lol. Man's been coasting regular season since forever. Don't be surprised if they beat bucks in 6 lol
"Lol, everytime I see random stats they almost always have ""Besides Lebron James"" or ""Players not named Lebron James"" or something along those lines"
"Granted those 3 winning seasons were awesome. New York actually being a good team, beating the Celtics in the playoffs, having actual battles with Lebron James and the Heatles, man those were the days lol"
"Lillard is balling out, he's averaging Wilt-like numbers in the past 10 games.  That being said, this list should be:  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. ... 3. Lebron James  End of list."
"Because Lebron James is at worst the second best player in basketball history aside from Michael Jordan, motherfucker was pretty much putting 35+ the whole playoffs, and at one point I think he was putting 40 a game."
Why is “basketball genius” Lebron James shooting 8 three pointers in a game? Particularly in a game that featured no opponents above 6’6?

"They got destroyed coming off of 2 championships. The heat were the heat were the favorites against the Mavericks, clearly a choke job by lebron James. And yet you want to say hypothetically would win all these championships with shaq etc. Guess what? Lebron only got three. Kobe got five."
Kobe has almost twice the first team all nba defense awards and is clearly the better scorer. Kobe has way more 40 plus point games. I don’t know how many people would try to make the argument lebron was a better scorer than Kobe. Not even lebron would say that. Kobe has more championships than lebron with less help in a tougher conference. Kobe played with Shaq at 21 and won 3 championships. No he wasn’t better than shaq at 21 years old.    Kobe embarrasses lebron James in front of everyone to the point an article is written about this and you go to your stat book to feel better lol.   No amount of cherry picked stats or sentences you type will change the reality that Kobe straight up schooled lebron in real life right after Jordan said he was better than lebron. And this is an old Kobe.

"Dude there's no way you could watch what happened to lebron james in that tape and say something like this. Either that or you're delusional. Lebron got wrecked, just admit it, it's okay. And it's not the only time that's happened by a longshot. Kobe routinely wrecked lebron james one on one.     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncMtXkL4Gu4"
"That's true but I'd say the defensive teams are less political because they're not as high profile. Kobe head up destroyed lebron one on one, again, I think it's funny that so many people can see this, for example, ""kobe bryant embarrasses lebron james at the all star game"" then just completely dismiss this and bring up whatever statistics they want to make an argument."
"Jesus I didn't know that but I don't think that really means lebron is better than kobe at all even. I mean think about it, lebron isn't averaging 35.6 points per game now, and didn't in his prime in playoff series, these are just stats taken out of context. There's no way rookie lebron james was a better scorer than he was in his actual prime and yet he averaged more points back then."
Dodgers didn’t have LeBron James. Have some faith fam.
That's not the only occasion. Kobe routinely got the better of lebron james in one on one situations.
Isn't your GM James Jones the GOAT (LeBron Teammate) ?
Playing the best in the regular season does not mean you ever had an argument to be the best player in the league. D Rose was never even marginally close to being a better basketball player than LeBron James yet he won MVP over him once too
"Shaq didn't carry kobe anywhere. Kobe as a kid was better than Shaq in two of those playoffs series (spurs, kings) which is ridiculous when you think about it. Kobe won 5 championships with less help than lebron did. Lebron lost to the mavericks in his prime with two prime all stars one of them a top 5 player in the league at the time. What a complete joke.    Plus lebron just got absolutely wrecked by kobe and you can see this on video tape. To the point there's an article linked here titled ""kobe bryant embarrasses lebron james at the all star game"" and this is just one occasion of kobe drinking lebron's soul with a silly straw."
Maybe Giannis will prove me wrong but I don’t see a world where it makes sense to trust him in a playoff series over Lebron fucking James lmao

doesn't mean shit if it's not something one does repetitively :-l   you're a lot sharper at something if you do it more often than not.... and usually on LeBron James led teams he controls the ball 99.9% of the time
"""This is the new style Lebron James. Still has it"".   Ummm...What?!?!?"
"uhh definitely not because people are tired of seeing a game with efficient shooting between teams with players like james harden, russell westbrook, lebron james, and anthony davis.  ratings are on the decline because:  a) streaming. dont kid urself, it's obviously a factor  b) there is no superteam  c) injuries  d) bad teams this season are really bad   e) the warriors/pels got too many national tv games  etc"

LeBron James is leaving   Again
"&gt; Except Giannis has made another leap from last year, and the player that this sub argues the most for being better than Giannis (LeBron) didnt even MAKE the playoffs last year lmfao  He’s made a regular season leap. Let’s see it translate to the playoffs before claiming him the undisputed best player in the league  &gt; Apparently missing the playoffs is better than getting to the conference finals  Lmao you really gonna act like there isn’t a reason LeBron fucking James gets the benefit of the doubt when it comes to playoff performance?"
"""*Alley oops all day...*"" - LeBron James"
" &gt;If your comment was right, teams would just trot out 5 powerforwards   IDK if you know your Eastern Conference history, but this is legitimately what teams tried to do.   The issue is that there are barely 5 capable Lebron defenders in the league and it's hard to get them all on the same team.    &gt;Also, if it weren't for one bad half, we'd be saying the same thing about the Clippers struggling against AD.  LAC is 2-0 vs LAL  You don't lose two games on the back of ""one bad half""  &gt;You're not playing Shamet against LeBron.  You are.   You might start someone else on Lebron, but he's the best player in the world and he dictates the game. He'll just single out your weak links and bully them until they're out of the rotation.   When you play against truly great players, they cross names off your roster. Guys you scheduled minutes for suddenly become unplayable.   Watch a Lebron James playoff series. Legitimately any Lebron James series.   &gt;someone else has to be quick enough to stay ahead of the guards when they cut and roll around screens  No...  When you're running lineups of forwards you don't have to worry about going over screens. You just switch.   &gt;LeBron is not the only player on the court.  Again, you need to watch more Lebron in the playoffs.   He's competing to be the Greatest of All Time for a reason."
Player of the decade is LeBron James. There's no other answer here.
"The greatest player of the decade is easily LeBron James. Here we go again with the bias and age of Reddit showing. It blows my mind sometimes.  LeBron hit his prime in 2010-2011. He won 2 titles with Miami, 4 straight Finals appearances. He then went on to 4 straight Finals appearances and 1 title with Cleveland. He won an Olympic gold medal in 2012.   Any answer other than LeBron for best player of the decade is just silly.   Durant and Steph are good 2a and 2b answers. But there's one clear #1"
"Seeming like a ""pretty chill person"" off the court is  a pretty vague and low bar to hit though... I mean what player strikes you as not chill?  We truly know 0 about most of these players' actual personalities aside from the ones like LeBron or Kyrie who share a lot or are often under scrutiny.  For all we know, James could actually be a really difficult to be around person despite chilling at the hottest clubs, wearing the freshest clothes and driving the dopest cars.  If anything I do feel like he has a very laid back persona but that's ON the court"
"All time Lakers starting 5  Magic Johnson - Arguably the best PG of all time  Kobe Bryant - top 7 player of all time at worst, often thrown into the GOAT conversation  LeBron James - arguably the GOAT, comfortably top 2  Kareem - Number 1 points in NBA history, arguably top 3 all time  Jerry West - The fucking logo   That’s not including Shaq - probably the most dominating player of all time Wilt Chamberlain - the guy who basically wrote the record books Elgin Baylor  James Worthy George Mikan     Common..."

"Seriously? Michigan is awesome. Look at the number of national parks compared to Ohio. Funny enough, Ohio’s only National Park shares a name with the river which caught on fire due to disgusting amounts of pollution. Places like Mackinac island and sleeping bear dunes provide wonderful variety to a land dotted in lakes coastlines, and forests. There is an entire upper peninsula, bonus Michigan! What is Ohio? A bland splotch in the middle of the country devoid of anything noteworthy.   Moving on from the actual physical state itself, Detroit is home to the American automotive industry. The success of companies such as ford using revolutionary assembly lines has literally shaped every city in the country. It’s influence is undeniable.   Michigan has played a large role in the acceptance of music from all kinds of people in the mainstream. Motown music is one of the greatest examples, gaining not only commercial success but also being even more important culturally. Not to mention Eminem, definitely one of the most notable artists of recent times.   Since we are in a sports subreddit, let us compare the importance of our states respective teams. The pistons have enjoyed far more success than the cavaliers, winning 3 championships to Cleveland’s 1. Not only that, but the identity of these teams surpasses anything ever seen in Ohio. The bad boys transcend the game and have cultural significance representative of the physicality of basketball at the time, and providing a legendary  rivalry for Michael Jordan, the greatest player of all time. The 2004 championship team was unique in having no superstar players, but instead a collection of icons who made each other better. Ben Wallace with his unmissable Afro, the distinctively lanky Tayshaun prince with one of the best blocks in NBA history, Rip with the face mask, ball don’t lie! And mr. big shot. This team went to 7 straight conference finals. The cavaliers on the other hand, while winning a championship more recently, have shown to be entirely reliant on LeBron James, who left to play the best ball of his career elsewhere. The success of the Cavs is entirely due to LeBron being born in Akron above team identity or anything else. People will remember those DETROIT teams, they will only remember your chip as Lebron’s.   We won’t even talk about the dynasty of the red wings vs... the blue jackets? Did I get that right?   Michigan is a place of varied natural beauty, innovation, and cultural significance; Ohio is an unfortunate side effect of our sprawling country, ultimately containing nothing of beauty nor value. I am not exaggerating when I say the most noteworthy thing to ever happen in Ohio is the birth of LeBron James. Skyline chili is dope though."
Yo that Lebron James Lineup is so good.  What happen with giannis pick lol
LeBron James is undefeated in the All-Star Game as a captain
"‘I watch em now because of LeBron but I’ve always hated the Lakers’ Isn’t that pretty much the definition of a bandwagon?  And yes, adding Anthony Davis and LeBron James brings in a lot of bandwagon fans. When you ask someone who has never watched ball before what teams they know it’s either Bulls, GS or Lakers, and only one of those teams are good.   I guarantee you that half of the Lakers ‘fans’ couldn’t name their rotation without googling names. While it ‘makes the old fans louder’ it also draws in a lot more bandwagons"
"I can see your general point, but I'd like to counter with the point that we and entertainers *think* that they're closer in lifestyle to the owner than people like you or me, but they're often a few bad decisions away from losing it, whereas billionaires can lose 99% of their wealth and still have 8-figure wealth. People like Paul Allen build boats that some navies would be jealous of. Latrell Sprewell got his boat foreclosed. To use Chris Rock's words, they're rich, not wealthy. There are some athletes who are wealthy, like Michael Jordan or LeBron James, and those making that super max will definitely come out being wealthy. But plenty are rich at best and many of them will go broke when they make a few bad decisions. Meanwhile, when an NBA owner makes a bad decision, the worst that can happen to them is that they'll have to sell the team for billions.  That said, I understand that what I said doesn't apply to Igoudala, who has been very well compensated throughout his career. But I also don't think it's true that it's a case of paying someone who didn't show up to work. I think the Grizzlies got what they wanted out of the trade, and nobody was making a big deal of it until a few young players started counting Iggy's money. It'll be funny if in a few years, they end up in a similar situation where they want to exert leverage over where they want to play basketball and they want people to understand where they're coming from.  I am not really a fan of any particular team, but I always think of the Celtics as my default favorite team because I lived in Boston for many years. I have admired how they've handled contracts and personnel over the past decade, turning their aging roster into young assets, getting valuable draft picks, drafting decently well, trading for and signing good players, etc. It looks good from the team's side. But then I think about IT. One bad injury, possibly made worse by trying to play for his team while injured, and the dude never got that payday and got treated like baggage by the team who benefited from his performances. Do I blame the Celtics? Nope. But it's things like that which make me realize why players need to be equally objective and ruthless when dealing with ownership and their career. They owe nobody anything. Grizzlies kept Iggy around to maintain his trade value. They had other options, and they chose to pay him. To me, it looks like everybody wins."
"The real answer??  Because the suns are now the bengals of the NBA , Devin Booker is one injury away from being AJ Green.  Because the suns fan base was actively supporting the team and building cool communities like the valley boys so it was in their best interest to offer to trade everyone’s favorite player.   Because the suns were still supporting their potato faced center named ayton or Eric or Pedro or whatever personality of the horde is currently holding the light even after he tanked the season on a steroid suspension which basically made Rubio check out.  Because uninterested fake hurt Rubio is better than booker loving dlo any day.   Because James Jones is under qualified to lead but sarver is cool wit it because he has lots of rings and didn’t ask for much money...plus , I hear he’s cool with lebron.   Because Larry Fitzgerald owns part of the team now and no one can ever appreciate Larry properly."
"Sorry amgio, but by next year it's gonna the world champions LeBron James and Anthony Davis as favorites to repeat."
is that miami heat legend Lebron James?!?!
First of all who's awarding anybody here?  Also by that logic then why isn't Lebron James on a minimum contract? Every single player in the league gets assessed by their past performances.
Yeah easily. One has an MVP and the other is about to win a ring.   One also made the finals and 4 western conference appearances.  Wtf has dame done besides one lucky run where he didnt face any actual teams?   Seriously? I'm even saying my team wasnt good last year. I'm being dead honest. Factually dame hasnt done shit except score points lmao.   PG was going toe to toe with LeBron. An actual playoff opponent. 2nd best ever.   Portland is never getting significantly better and dame got two years before the big decline.   Clippers are eventual champions and westbrook is with james harden.    You really think the next few years arent gonna be more kind to them? Lol I'm done. Btw you can just edit your post dont gotta reply to me 15 times like a scorned ex.  Actually send as many as you want I'm not gonna read whatever struggle posts you got. Have fun with dame. In two years he's gonna start looking like a scrub
"Los Angeles Lakers have informed Lebron James that he will not be moved, league sources tell Yahoo Sports."
Sources also say Lebron James will remain on the Lakers
"Eh..barely.  I'm talking to people who have visited, and I've heard that the downtown is actually nice and improving. I've been in a surrounding suburb once and it was nice, and Michigan in general is dope.  The only thing I've heard about Cleveland is some guy named Lebron James played there."
Someone remind the Lakers they have LeBron fucking James on their team. Mans are out here holding on to C Tier prospects.
"Damn this whole thing feels like sucking Bron's dick but here we go..  I don't disagree that Kobe had that killer gene, and I've alluded to the idea that LeBron took a long time to get out of bad habits (of sorts) of still looking for the most open shot, instead of saying ""I need to get this bucket."" But the stats don't lie, and two players who had full control of the offense for a 12 year stretch both took different routes towards getting their teams wins. I just look at LeBron as being a more complete player, and the stats weigh out on him being a more assured win in clutch situations. I've watched more Kobe games and LeBron games than I can count; I know the Kobe Assist kinda throws a wrench into the numbers, because he legitimately looked at boxout positions when taking his shots and factored that into his attempts (somehow, the fucking manic basketball mind of KB mystifies me), but I don't think that offsets the FG% enough for me to justify saying that that discrepancy disappears or flips based on the untracked Kobe Assist.  In terms of the ""watch the games"" argument, I feel like even people who follow the game very closely wouldn't know that clutch stat because of a. How impossible it is to watch every game from every superstar in the league over an 82-game schedule and b. The way the national sports media has historically covered LeBron vs the way they've covered other stars.  Anecdotally it's said that nobody gets more scrutiny than Tiger Woods and LeBron James (the New Age Prodigies ©). Every time LeBron didn't take the last shot when Kobe and he were in their primes, they would have to bounce that single instance off of Kobe's legacy for the next week, because that's what sportscasters do; debate legacies.  Due to their conflicting styles of play, counting stats didn't give the best comparison, and in fact played into the ""Kobe the Killer Scorer vs LeBron the Plough Horse"" narrative that allowed the ""clutch gene"" to be so disparaged in the case of LeBron.  At the end of the day, to each their own; I love that due to the flow of the game and the intangible variables that the flow will add behind the scenes, getting really cleanly partitioned stats is a pipe dream.  Conversations like this, even if the ""stats"" clearly point in one direction, have too many holes in the statistics to be able to lean definitively one way."
We've got 3:  LeBron James - 2003  Dwight Howard - 2004  Anthony Davis - 2012
"Don’t forget that when he was on the heat, he actually jumped up to try to block a 20-year-old LeBron James in 2004"
And then the line will continue when we trade Russell for Lebron James Jr
"Woj: ""The Hornets have just traded for Lebron James"""
LEBRON JAMES IS A POOR MAN'S BRUNO CABOCLO
"Not really.. lebrons clutch stats over the course of his career are close (I think potentially even higher? I'll edit with sources) than Kobe's, the all-time Clutch King (perception-wise).  LeBron had a couple of high profile whiffs that really hurt his reputation as a clutch player, but even into his early Cavs return he was still trying to balance his ""do-everything, make the right play"" mentality with the need for somebody to step up and take the big shots.  Edit: source  https://www.libertyballers.com/2012/2/29/2832299/lebron-james-kobe-bryant-dwyane-wade-clutch-nba-playoffs-4th-quarter  I didn't want to go through the trouble of compiling all the info, but as of the writing of this article (2012), LeBron's all-time Clutch shooting% (.460) takes the top spot on that list, more than half a point higher than Kobe's (.397). I understand this is only from 2000-2012, but 12 years is still a good indicator of the level LeBron has been playing at in clutch situations in relation to his legacy competitors in the modern game.  He's had some pretty big misses and deferrals late-game since then (I remember a terrible kickout to Chalmers for a three after he dribbled himself into three guys in the paint with a couple seconds left), but he's also had some great hits (Washington back leg fadeaway triple, that fucking godawful runner against the Raps a couple years back). I think it's a testament to the amount of negative scrutiny LeBron's game is under that he still can't shake this false narrative despite the amazing things he's done over his career in any game situation."
"LeBron should have won MVP.  He averaged 46 MPG, 36 PPG, 13 RPG, 9 APG ...... leading a bunch of bums like Mozgov, JR, TT and Dellavedova. Love was injured in the previous series against the Celtics (I was actually at that game), Kyrie out in Game 1, and the bench had players like ..... Mike Miller, Kendrick Perkins, James Jones .... Shumpert was at least okay ....  That's a hot garbage roster and barely a bench, and LeBron took a damn good Warriors team to 6 games."
"Yes. LeBron James is one of the most efficient players ever and he wasn't in that series, especially late and that's because of Andre's defense. I was initially upset for Steph because he averaged what? 26? But Andre was so important in that Finals and im glad he got the recognition for it"
I have made inquiries about Lebron James. Not sure that one can come together on a deal. Lebron has played well this year on the Lakers
"I'm more referencing on the method and not just super teams in general. In another comment I reference hating GSW but respecting the hell out of them because they were built through the draft (Until KD). It's a hard balance for me, because I typically always want to side with the players, but disparity between teams hurts the league.   What would happen to the league theoretically if Lebron/KD/AD/Harden/Steph decided to team up and all take the same salary at like 15 mill a year for 3 years? It's not likely, but I don't think there is anything that could stop players from doing this at this point through FA. My point being that James/Wade/Bosh did something in a new very different way to win championships and take control of where they play and who they play with."
LeBron James jr vs Zaire Wade
"In guessing you hate advanced stats for some strange reason.   So how about a traditional one? He's averaging 15 PPG on 14shots. If all he offers the team is scoring and he doesn't do it effficiently I don't really see an argument for him being good.   His efficiency is woeful (50% TS), he takes 14 shots per game and barely gets to the line, he is an sell defender. Where's the good play in there? I get it, he used to be great. I liked Melo too he was fun to watch. But he just isn't a positive player anymore. And that's ok!! He's 35!! Not everyone can age like Lebron James.."
"It's somewhat close but I'd rather have Howard, because he actually plays center.   If I take Davis, I have to play another big at center, because he doesn't like playing there. That is going to make my team worse than playing Howard and four shooters (unless I have like, LeBron James on the roster).  If you could brainwash Davis into playing center, then I'd probably take him."
"""Oh . It looks like the referee is ejecting Lebron James for rubbing his nutsack on Draymond Green's head. An absolutely disgusting act."""
"Bosh was one of the best mid range shooters in the game. Over 50% from 18 feet out and that was his preferred shot profile. Teams were not eagerly leaving him to help on James. LeBron did have a major spacing advantage himself, even if not as strong as Giannis.  You are completely ignoring Giannis' defensive advantage, as per usual. Leave it to you defense doesn't exist."
"You don't need to put Lebron on Curry, that's the point.  Teams simply have more personnel to guard PG's, but to counter bigger guys like James you need specific personnel.  Chandler/Marion/Stevenson, Kawhi/Duncan/Splitter, Green/Iguodala/Barnes etc.  These are much more rare.  2005 Game 7 Billups was 3-8 from the field.  In 2004 he was 3-5 from the field."
"*2012 Finals, Game 2*  ""Durant on the drive...falls short. FOUL ON JAMES! The officials have just called a foul on LeBron James."""
IGUODALA GOES UP!  LEBRON JAMES WITH THE BLOCK!  NO!  NORTH GRIFFEY CALLED GOALTENDING!  (Hahahaha! JK! That was a GREAT clean block!)
"What? Kawhi is 7th in the NBA in scoring this season, has a 46/37/90 shooting split and was 6th in scoring last year with a 50/37/85 split. He also had one of the best playoff performances of *all time* last year.   He's one of six players to ever average more than 31 points per game in a single post-season (min 17 games played) joining Jerry West, MJ, Olajuwon, AI, and Lebron. He and LJ are the only forwards to do this.  The only other player in the last 20 seasons to reach the 35-point mark as many times in a single playoff *before* reaching the Finals is LeBron James. He also brought lockdown defense.  Has he been in fortunate circumstances? Yes. But if he keeps it up he'll go down a top 25 talent."
"There is an NFL scout who said the best WR prospects he had seen at the high school level were Jerry Rice, Steve Largent and LeBron James."
"Apparently if Lebron James didnt pursue basketball, there would've been a good chance he would've played in the NFL"

"In basketball, the impact of a truly great player going down is felt immensely, more so than in football (11 players vs 5)/cricket (variability) imo.   Both the Warriors and the Cavs went through very drastic changes.  For the Warriors, they:  - Lost a top 3 player in the league in free agency, and lost another top 3 player to injury this season.   - Lost another star player to injury.   - Traded away yet another one player (their 5th or 6th best) to clear space for D'Angelo Russell (now Wiggins). The other player who is 5th or 6th best from last year also got injured for the majority of this season.  - Replaced all their older players with younger player who are inexperienced and frankly not that good currently, or players out of the G-League who'll need time to adapt to the NBA's speed and playstyle.  So, literally the only player in their rotation who played significant numbers for them last year is Draymond Green, who can not initiate scoring, and thus is limited without good personnel.  Cavs didn't undergo THIS drastic of a change, but they had LeBron James and another star player - Kyrie Irving - leave as well.  I can't think of a football team in recent years that has had this much of roster overturn between one season and the next. Though Arsenal are not good at all this year, Aubameyang , Ozill, Xhaka, Lacazette, Bellerin, etc are sill there and playing this year. They haven't had their entire roster flip over on its head, which is what happened to the Warriors."
Weird how guys like Steve Nash and Kobe Bryant and LeBron James who took care of their bodies didn’t have a lot of injuries.   But notoriously lazy guys like Chandler Parsons &amp; Boogie stay hurt.
Their best two players are LeBron James and Anthony Davis
LeBron some nights. James others
"Yeah, anyone with .5 IQ could tell you that’s a lie. Name a time Cleveland was competitive without a Lebron James in the last 20 years"
"""The Lakers team led by Lebron James and Anthony Davis just released DeMarcus Cousins""   Yeah that would be fucking insane"
Memphis doesn't have that fortitude that Lebron James does.
Luka and Lebron methodically manipulate the entire opposing team’s defense while James Harden does it to individual defenders
"He is playing like it. His combo of offense + defense puts him ahead of other pgs. This stat also says James Harden is the best shooting guard, Lebron the best small forward, Giannis the best power forward, and Jokic the best center."
Yeah I’m sure the nba is trying to screw over Lebron James and the Lakers. Nothing Adam Silver would like more than an early Lakers exit in the playoffs. That’ll be great for ratings.
"LeBron James (and it isn't that close), followed by KD and then Kawhi right behind him  2013 LeBron was literally the best all around player of all time; driving, shooting, passing, rebounding, defending 1-4, you name it."
LeBron James whines after every missed call and doesn't get T'd up that quick. Your status in the league matters. He doesn't get the benefit of the doubt.
The only thing stopping him was playing in the same era as Lebron James and Kevin Durant
https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/2/20/21146384/lakers-news-lebron-james-frank-vogel-demarcus-cousins-discuss-possibility-playoff-return-podcast  looks like you’re a true novice at reading and comprehending
So james harden is better than lebron? He 4-1'd the cavs superteam and SWEPT lebron the year after
"People generally don't like basing their entire season prediction on an injury hypothetical. If you said that ""Lakers are gonna be trash next year IF LeBron James, Anthony Davis both get injured and miss all of next season"", yeah you can expect downvotes."
"The Cleveland franchise is a goddamn testament to incompetence, and has been since the league had to change the rules around draft pick trades because their owner was so shitty at it.   They’ve gotten incredibly lucky over and over again with the draft, and had the best player of his generation be born an hour away and go pro the same year they sucked again and got lucky again. All Cleveland has ever done to succeed is fall ass backwards into high picks and have LeBron James bail them out. I couldn’t stand the “Earned, not Given” motto when they got that title, because that franchise was handed its success on a golden platter."
"I know alot of people didn't think the Lakers would do great, but that was always stuid to me. Lebron James and Anthony Davis alone on a team is insane."
Lebron James (unbeknownst to Lebron James) is a genetically modified super-soldier prototype designed by the US military.
"The fact that you came here and posted about it, including their names, is literally all they want. Skip Bayless has made an entire career and likely lives in a mansion by hating on Lebron James everyday."

Don’t forget Undisputed just had a topic asking if Lebron James can be president. Skip is obsessed with this man. He needs to cut him a check
"God, can you please give back MICHAEL JORDAN and take LEBRON JAMES from us? This is REAL BASKETBALL"
"You said Rich Paul's race is the reason people are familiar with Klutch Sports, which is bullshit. People are familiar with Klutch Sports because it is run by LeBron James' best friend. Klutch Sports would still get more attention and be more prominent than other agencies if Lebron's friend had happened to be white. Bringing race into it is entirely unnecessary."
"Everytime I see a new Cavs headline it just reasserts the fact that Lebron’s Championship with Cleveland is one of the greatest accomplishments in NBA history. The Cavs franchise is run by idiots from top the bottom and the only relevancy they will ever have is the fact that they were blessed with Lebron James for more than 10 seasons.  I really do feel for the fans though, I’m glad they got to see a chip and competitive basketball for 10 years."

"That team had a very good defense around LeBron James. They held the Spurs in the finals WAY below league average offensive efficiency. Bad example, give Young defensive support and the Hawks are substantially better.  &gt; Dude is great offensively but does that matter when teams can score the same amount or more on him?  Except this doesn’t happen."
You replied to a comment about Kevin Love and inexplicably start bringing up LeBron James China shit. What the hell drugs are you on?
Everyone mentioning fringe all-stars but I'd say LeBron James Jr

"how did he play in 2017, 2018, 2019, with realistically zero chance of winning a ring, incouding one of the greatest playoff runs of all time in 2018?  this is lebron james man. he'll keep dragging his teams deep in the playoffs no matter what. the lakers have the best record in the west, and will likely have a top 3 record against next year. I'm sure they'll get fairly deep in the playoffs too. Lebron isn't gonna give up on a team this good, with a solid chance to win the ring every year."
Feels like you're forgetting Lebron James? Lol
"Who were our starters the previous year? How many remained on the team or didn't get injured? Most starts the 09-10; Anthony Parker, LeBron James, JJ Hickson, Mo Williams and Shaq. Most games played: Anthony Parker, JJ, LeBron, Varejao, Mo and then Big Z. 3 people from the first list were gone the next year. LeBron, Mo and Shaq. 4 people were injured or gone the next year from the second list. LeBron, Varejao, Mo and Big Z.   So no it was essentially 4 starters. You can even say 3. Take 3 starters off most teams right now. One being their best player. See how well they'll do."
"yeah unless we’re talking about a guy who takes most of their team’s final shots for several years and get a sample size going (LeBron obviously, but also Damian Lillard and James Harden) those stats are always gonna be more smoke than fire"

"He was never very good to begin with honestly. Always been a MAJOR liability on both ends of the floor. If you’re scoring 17 points per game but you’re doing it on 40% shooting PLUS you’re the worst defender on the floor, you’re always going to be a negative for your team. You might be scoring but you’re doing it inefficiently, and your giving more points back on the defensive end because you literally can’t stop anyone or do anything.   Plus fuck that guys attitude. The way he acted in Cleveland was ridiculous. Lebron gave his ass like 10 games before he was like GET this dude off my team right now. Think about all the toxic and head cases  Lebron has somehow turned into winners, guys we been told would “never be a part of championship team.” Jr Smith, Birdman, Kyrie, Love. He completely rejuvenated the careers of guys like Jeff Green, Dwight Howard, Alex Caruso, James Jones...... and yet he couldn’t even stand Isiah for more than 15 games. This dude played next to Jr Smith for 4 years and he still couldn’t stand Isiah, that’s how dysfunctional he was.   Dude fell off a cliff for a million reasons."
Yes but lebron James... He made it to the finals like forever.. Show me a vegas odds or anything legit that proves you're point
"Interestingly, the Sacramento Kings additionally haven't had a winning season without LeBron James since 2006."

Kobe, Kevin Durant, Allen Iverson, Steph Curry, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Kareem, Wilt, Shaq, Charles Barkley, Magic, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie, Jerry West, Bob Pettit, James Worthy, Wade, Elgin Baylor, George Mikan, Dr. J, Isiah Thomas, John Havlicek, Rick Barry, Cliff Hagan."

I think when you look at somebody who hasn't manifestly done anything before or after LeBron James played with them is in no way in contention for the Hall of Fame. I get it he was part of one magical moment...  Robert horry hit a lot of important gamewinners. Dude has seven rings. Dude is not in the Hall. Kyrie should have had a higher ceiling than horry. But here we are.
"Oh. I thought you were being sarcastic. My bad.  Anyways, he has shown some semblance of care for other races at [a national level.](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/lebron-james-donald-trump-immigration-order-muslim-ban) Nothing extraordinary but it’s something."
"&gt;Except he didn't.  He literally did. You're plain lying. I never said claimed he was efficient.  &gt;I originally said the value of LAC picking up Morris was that you wanted to have as many capable Lebron defenders on the court as possible to mitigate his ability to switch onto favourable matchups.   This has historically not worked. Once you take take out all your defensive weaknesses or force Lebron to catch the ball late in the shot clock with a good defender on him, he just goes at that defender and succeeds. You can see this particularly when the Warriors benched Curry and Lebron was playing against either Iguodala, Durant, Draymond, Klay, or Looney. You could also see in the clips I showed you re: Morris and you could also look at Lebron vs Kawhi in the finals. Most of the time Lebron shoots against the best defender when he has too. The Clippers will force him too, and James will win if he's still that guy.  &gt;You can't blame Morris for other guys making poor reads. It's not his job to think for them.  No, but it speaks to capability of Morris as a defender on James. If Morris was defending Andre Roberson Horford wouldn't be looking over. It's effectively a double team though you won't admit it.  &gt;Basketball is 5-on-5 not 1-on-5. You don't seem to understand that concept at all.  lmao. YOU are the one claiming that Morris can contain Lebron and do it without help."
God I love looking back at old threads.  &gt; Draft is rigged and they get the #1  &gt; Celtics draft Wiggins  &gt; One of the most prolific sports franchise's of all time gets the next Lebron James/Kobe
"This is not exclusive to Kawhi. For example, Kawhi doesn't try to score on Lebron. Kawhi has scored a total of 5 on Lebron this year. And it's the same the other way James has only scored 5 points total on Kawhi. It's just smart basketball to seek mismatches just running straight at your primary defender is Westbrook tier basketball.  James lit up Kawhi in the 2013 and 2014 finals."
"Hahahaha I can't tell if you are a new Warriors fan who just doesn't know any better or if you're a true Wiggins truther with how came up with that answer. You couldn't find a single game statistic to help your argument so you go to a ridiculous stat like youngest to 8,000 points haha. Wiggins is by far the least efficient scorer on that list any the only reason he made the list is because he's an iron man and played more games by 24 than 95% of the NBA, hence the list isn't fastest to 8,000 points.  Here is a [list] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=18&amp;age_max=25&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=8000&amp;order_by=ws) of players up until their age 25 season who have scored at least 8,000 points. I sorted it by WS for you. Lebron is at the top with a 103.3 and Wiggins is dead last at 15.1. Talk shit about the Wolves all you want but KAT is at a 50.7 which is more than 3 times better than Wiggins.    &gt; And he's 24. James Harden, one of the best offensive players of all time was one year from being a bench player at 24.      Haha this might be the most comical thing you've said. Harden won 6th man of the year when he was 22 and when he was 23 he lead Houston to the playoffs by scoring 25.9 points on a better TS% than Wiggins has ever had in his career. Why don't you compare Wiggins to Curry next?      &gt; He's not a fucking role player the 3rd guy on the Spurs bench is a role player    I love how you have to compare him to the 3rd best player on the 10th place spurs team when I specifically asked you to give me an example of a championship team who had that bad of a 3rd best player. Again you couldn't do it so you do your mental gymnastics and decide to compare him to the Spurs 3rd best player haha.     I love Wiggins, go back and look at my comments. I'm just being real while Warrior fans are dreaming. I hope Wiggins figures it out and proves me wrong but I'm basing my argument on cold hard facts while your entire argument is 100% based on speculation that he is going to get 10% better (what the fuck does that even mean???)"
You know it's LeBron.  [He won't even pay for Spotify Premium](https://factoryofsadness.co/2016/03/26/lebron-james-doesnt-pay-for-spotify/)
"His shooting can be streaky, but I’m going with LeBron James."
LeBron James.
"Because he’s going to have way better stats and accolades, that’s why. 3x more first team all NBA’s to start. More points, rebounds, assists, and steals as well. IDGAF that Lebron joined the team Wade was already on, no one in their right fucking mind would say Wade was better or more important to that team than Lebron James."
"&gt; Please give me 1 stat that shows Wiggins is a good to great player  https://www.nba.com/timberwolves/news/andrew-wiggins-becomes-11th-youngest-player-score-8000-points  &gt;Andrew Wiggins needed just 10 points entering Monday night’s game against the Pistons to hit the 8,000 mark for his career.  &gt;At 24 years and 261 days old, Wiggins became the 11th youngest player to hit that mark.  &gt;You might be familiar with the 10 players to reach the mark at a younger age than Wiggins:  &gt;LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, Shaquille O’Neal, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Dwight Howard, Bob McAdoo and John Drew.""  And he's 24. James Harden, one of the best offensive players of all time was one year from being a bench player at 24.   &gt; So you are paying max money to a below average player by basically every single metric in hope that he is a solid ""role player""  He's not a fucking role player the 3rd guy on the Spurs bench is a role player Wiggins is a 10% improvement away from being an all-star. Better efficiency (by not having to create/force shots in a shit system) and better off ball D and he's there.  &gt; As in Wiggins is going to post those numbers even though in 5+ seasons he has never been above league average in efficiency.  Sounds like you are one of the Wolves fans not hoping he reaches his potential in GS. That's sad, you shouldn't be a bitter person. You should root for other people to succeed, in general.  remindme! 1 year"

Arguably didn’t drastically affect Cleveland’s overall economy let alone the entire state of Ohio.   * So the Cleveland economy most recently grew strongest in those initial years following the recession while James was playing in Florida.

"&gt;A Maryland youth development nonprofit sued LeBron James’ Uninterrupted LLC, Nike Inc., and ESPN  This is probably going nowhere for them.

"Lebron james has lost a little speed and strength but his game has evolved as well dude is playing the best defense hes played since he was on the Heat by a pretty wide margin right now, his facilitating is the best it's ever been, and his rebound rate is around thr same as usual. I can make an argument that hes playing significantly better than his first 2 years back in Cleveland and about the same as his last 2 in Cleveland. Hes averaging 2 less points per game and 3 more assists per game on the same shooting splits as his average and that's despite being next to another top 5 esque player. Even the 2 points can be explained by the fact that hes not getting to the line nearly as much as usual. It's completely fair to say he cant yam it on people or outrun the entire court quite the same as he used to but he only went from THE best athlete in the league (and one of the best ever) too one of the best athletes in the league. Hes no Giannis out there right now but hes still a monster."
“And with the 16th pick in the 2024 nba draft the Miami Heat select Lebron James Jr”.
"If you're admitting he declined athletically, then how can he be every bit as good as the last decade? That logic makes no sense. His passing is still accurate. His shooting hasn't been as sharp as his last season with Cleveland, I don't think. Like LeBron James of 2 years ago doesn't lose to a depleted Portland team. He doesn't get stuffed by Patrick Beverley on the closing seconds of a game. Is it because he only succeeds when there's shooting around him? That's no longer true because he can't force himself in the paint the way he used too. Last decade? You must be a Laker fan."
Is this good for Miami? Seems like a lot of money for a 36 year old not named Lebron James.
yeah but LeBronto also had LeBron James.
"My gosh no wonder this sub says we victimize ourselves. It’s cause he’s fricking LeBron James that’s why. This was a hype play and will be talked about tonight. Just enjoy the moment bro, it was a great one!"
This is why serge is the most winningest player behind Lebron James in the last decade.

Kyrie would claim a grade 3 sprain to his inner eye and would have to sit the rest of the year if LeBron James joined the Nets.
The Lebron James method in 2018
"free agency is reliable? The Knicks just spent 2 years building up to 2019 free agency and got Randle and Bobby Portis, leading to another disaster season.   The Knicks mistake over the last two decades has been trying to bypass the draft by signing big free agents. They ended up with Starbury, Eddy Curry, Jerome James, and Melo. Missed out on LeBron, KD, Kyrie, etc. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, while expecting different results. D Russell would just be another one of those players."
"Okay, I'll rephrase. Can't say I know what the difference between being more impactful and being better at basketball is.   I'm not sure I trust a stat that says Lou Williams is more impactful than Trae Young and that Ben Simmons has the second most impact behind LeBron James.   Why are you so reserved when it comes to revealing the equation for your stat? It would make our judgements of it much more informed."
"God, I wish the Lakers would just cut Rondo. He is washed.   Rondo always has a terrible plus minus and is a turnover machine. He can't space the floor, shoot, pass, or defend. These are the types of players that you never want on a LeBron James team. Vogel also has the audacity to commit the ultimate sin: Playing Rondo and LeBron at the same time, especially in the fourth quarter!"
"The 59 win Raptors were doubling LeBron James and letting him pass to wide open players in the corner lmao. Maybe if they let LeBron eat and covered the shooters, they would've won"
I'm not sure I trust stats that say Lou Williams &gt; Trae Young or that say Ben Simmons is the best player in the league not named LeBron James. Would be interesting to see how they're generated though!

"I'm like 99% sure every GM calls all the other GMs and just shamelessly spitballs.   Knicks: Hey Lakers, are you guys looking to trade that  Lebron James guy?  Lakers: Dont think so cheif  Knicks: Okay, no harm in asking right?     Media: Knicks and Lakers discuss block buster trade!"
"Sustainable? PG and kawhi are both more injury prone than Bron. Kawhi's chronic injury has hampered his defense in the playoffs, too. Basically even kawhi will slow down, man was limping in the finals.   Not to say clippers aren't more deep, but they have bigger weaknesses that can be exploited such as lack of playmaking and their center, too. Lakers at the very least have a better defensive core altho they also have few playmakers BUT at least they have one of the best of all time, LeBron James. Clips severely lack that."
We don't gotta compare anyone I'm just saying thhis is all he said she said. We don't know how the whole NBA works and it's dumb to assume it works in some certain way. Lebron is gifted athlete no matter what drugs dont' give you the frame and power Lebron James has. Like I said earlier 1.5mil can easily transform a body in a natural and healthy way.
LeBron James.
Yeah man. If we could just replace Trevor Ariza with Lebron James we could actually make the finals.
"To some of my favorite jews: Jesus Christ, Jerry Seinfeld, and of course, LeBron James."
"&gt;I'm talking strictly age-wise.  So Lebrons next 3 years basically.  I get your point though  What difference does age matter if Lebron has played hundreds more NBA games than Karl Malone at comparable ages. NBA games will wear down a player physically and James has many more than Malone. Lebron James has played 1,484 regular season and playoff games (1245 + 239). Karl Malone player 1,258 regular season and playoff games (1,110 + 148) though he’s 14th season, when he was 35.   So Lebron James has played 226 more NBA games than Karl Malone and that’s going through Malone whole age 35 season (LBJ just turned 35 a month ago so the better comparison may be Malone’s age 34 year). That’s 3 seasons worth of games. 39 minutes a game."

Doesn’t matter because LeBron fucking James.
"&gt;The 3-pointer from way deep is the trademark of Steph Curry, and yet it’s James whose precision from several steps behind the arc is on pace to break records.** Through Monday, James has made 52.3 percent (23 for 44) of his shots from 28 feet or farther from the hoop**,1 according to Basketball-Reference.com. That’s not only the best this season among players who have taken at least 15 of those shots, but it’s also the best anyone has shot from that deep since the 2000-01 season, the furthest back play-by-play data is available on Basketball-Reference.com.  Bertans is shooting .508 this year (30/59). IT is at .600 but he's only attempted 15, so that could fluctuate before the end of the season. Dame is great at 66/143 for a very, very respectable .405 on the year.   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-james-is-the-new-steph-curry/"

"So here’s the theoretical timeline.  Rich Paul becomes the new GM. In 3 years of tanking and stocking assets they draft Bronny #1 overall and sign Lebron in free agency. Using the assists they’ve stock piled they can trade for some competitive pieces to build around Bronny while Lebron makes sure he has a smooth transition into the league. After the season ends Lebron retires and let’s his son take over as the new face of the league and face of the Knicks.   Now Rich has built up some credibility and Dolan gives him the role of President of Basketball Ops but it’s obviously too much to balance all the responsibility at once. So who does he hire as the new GM? LeGM, Lebron James Sr who will make all moves possible to built a championship caliber team around his son for the next 20 years."

[Woj] The Los Angeles Lakers agreed to trade LeBron James and Anthony Davis to the Golden State Warriors for Ky Bowman  /s
"Curry’s Warriors won 73 regular season games, an NBA record. He broke his own record for 3-pointers made in a season with 24 games to play — ultimately shattering his own mark by 116 (Carmelo Anthony made only 105 total 3-pointers this season.) He became the second member of the 50/45/90 club (field goal percentage, 3-point percentage, free-throw percentage), despite having a 10 percent higher usage rate than the other member, Steve Nash. He also became the first member of the 50/40/90 club to lead the NBA in scoring.   Curry is the only player other than Michael Jordan to average 30 points, six assists, five rebounds, and shoot 50 percent from the floor in a season. Jordan did it three times, in 1989, 1990, 1992, but he never did that in a league where he couldn’t be double-teamed until he had the ball, and he certainly wasn’t hitting 3s like Curry.   The baby-faced assassin wasn’t just shooting 3-pointers every time he came down the court either. He led the league in shooting percentage on layups this season (68 percent) and at 6-foot-3 and 185 pounds, he shot just shy of 70 percent from within 3-feet of the rim — numbers that put him in the company of the aforementioned centers and LeBron James, who is an X-Men character playing basketball."

"Or from ""Got lucky Lebron James wanted to shoot Space Jam 2 in LA"" to ""Got lucky again Davis forced his way from NOLA there because Lebron was there."""
"Adrian Wojnarowski yelled out, “There you go! There you go!"" Ramona Shelburne gave a look of pleasant surprise. Shams Charania yelled out, “We got an [expletive] trade now.” And before Kuzma hit the locker room door, NBA great Lebron James hugged him and said, “You're going to the Knicks."""
Or they could just send one Lebron James or even Anthony Davis
I swear there’s a bot that gives silver to any post with “LeBron James” or “Lakers” in the title  Dame robbed
"Lebron James and Chris Bosh, the 06-07 season was my first season where I actually payed attention to the Raps"
"It's interesting to me that whenever Iggy talks come up, everyone pretty much says how Memphis likely won't buy him out, Laker fans come busting in with downvotes as to why they should buy him out (to save a couple million at best or for reputation!), then they get all defensive when others call them out (sometimes preemptively).  Then half the time I get responses like, ""YOU ARE JUST SCARED.""  You guys have LeBron fucking James and Anthony Davis.  They concern me in the playoffs, not a fucking 36 year old dude who hasn't played in nearly half a year.  You are literally throwing out any possibility for discussion with actual substance when you say, ""Nobody knows, but maybe!""  That's why people are fucking downvoting you.  Call me a clown all you want, but posts like that are the reason this sub is a shitshow half the time."
1. Hire Rich Paul.  2. Tank for 2.5 seasons.  3. Draft LeBron James Jr. in 2022.  4. Lure LeBron James Sr. in 2022 off-season.  5. Profit.
Cavs also had LeBron James

Jim Dolan hires LeBron James as GM.
"Dwight Howard, Anthony Davis, Javale Mcgee, Lebron James, DeMarcus Cousins( Doubt he comes back tho) would abuse the Rockets in the paint"
"thats a hard disagree,   Celtics had title expectations until Hayward had his injury and then came back the next year and was basically a negative but was still get minutes for some reason, the Bucks would have swept the Blazers, judging by how poorly Lillard played against them in the reg season.  &gt;Westbrook’s thunder teams got overhyped and he lost in the first round every time and got destroyed by dame head to head (first time wasn’t on him tho tbf)  Sure he outplayed Westbrook and is the better player right now but you can't just take away what Westbrook has done especially with KD, although he has been pretty awful the last 2 playoffs.  &gt;Also I have no doubt that dame could play as well as they do as a 2nd option, he just didn’t get to play with lebron James and Kevin Durant  if, if ,if."
"Not when both players get completely exposed by themselves, Celtics had title expectations, got gentleman swept by the bucks  Westbrook’s thunder teams got overhyped and he lost in the first round every time and got destroyed by dame head to head (first time wasn’t on him tho tbf)  Also I have no doubt that dame could play as well as they do as a 2nd option, he just didn’t get to play with lebron James and Kevin Durant"
"Yeah, they were dead in the water bc they didn’t have an answer for James until game 4 when Kerr decided to start Iggy.  Our centers were being destroyed by Lebron and mozgov on the boards."
"Lol yes because there isn't a massive gap between Jamal Murray and LeBron fucking James. Jamal Murray has shown no improvement, is not even in the realm of being a legitimate star as it stands, and in no way deserves a 5 year max"
Lebron without James Jones = loser  Lebron with James Jones = three time champ
"It's hilarious because without AD that Pelicans team would be a lottery team tanking for Zion. Where tf is Mirotic right now 😂 You said AD has done ""NOTHING"" in the league ignoring his 3x Blocks champ, 7x All star, 3x All NBA accolades. Oh and now he has Lebron James as his teammate lmao."
BECAUSE LEBRON HAS DONE IT BEFORE 😂 Lebron averaged a triple double against the 73 - 9 warriors team in 2016. Averaged 34 points in the 2018 playoffs with Jeff Green as his second best player. He WILL average a 30 point triple double or VERY close numbers. You just dont know who Lebron James is.

Or “LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE” was pretty hype too
The injury prone soft big and LeBron James lite that shoots 0.0001 outside shots a year should ask for it? Lol
Because young Lebron James was the fastest and strongest player in the league. People forgot how fucking fast that man was back in the day.
"LeBron is top 1 for a lot of people and probably top 3 for most people. If he isn’t in your top 5 then you definitely have an agenda.   Kawhi is extremely underrated. There are very few flaws to his game. He also won finals MVP on a brilliant Spurs side and then with Toronto, leading them to their first ever chip in the process. That type of career puts him top 15-20 imo and he’s only 28 so has time to further cement his legacy.  Curry and Durant are the hardest comparison to make. Curry changed 3 point shooting forever and has highly influenced the generation we see now. KD has been one of the best players in the NBA almost every year since he arrived. These guys are definitely top 20. Some may argue higher and you can understand why but it’s definitely not lower imo.  James Harden is the player people love to hate but we all know how good he really is. Not winning a ring is big but it shouldn’t take away from the fact that he’s one of the best offensive players the league has ever seen. Top 40 for him is fair with a push for top 30.  AD and Giannis. The reason I put these 2 together is because of playoff inexperience but at the same time they are young so have years on their side. Giannis will have the better career imo and could easily end up being a top 10 player of all time. AD is having a good career so far but don’t think he’ll be top 10 or 20. I can see him being a top 40 player when it’s all set and done. Right now they are both top 50/60 but you have to remember they are young so it’s harder to judge in comparison to the others on the list."
&gt; And you know that how? You have inside info? A lot would take Durant. Even Curry some of those years.  The GMs take a survey every year and their vote for MVP has been LeBron James every year since at least 2013 has been LeBron James.
LeBron James with Harden’s statline a would’ve won the MVP last year. Probably would’ve won it in 15 and 17 too. Media shamelessly plays favorites.
"&gt; Even LeBron James missed the Playoffs with the Lakers before Anthony Davis arrived.   This is the worst sentence spoken on here that people think is actually meaningful.  Inb4 ""they were 28-27 with him playing"" as if injury recovery doesn't exist."
"NBA is more popular and will eventually become Top 3 sport in the world  The way Americans watch Soccer in Europe (Premier League, Champions League, etc) will be the way people will watch the NBA. Hence, why they want an i season tournament.  You can argue James Harden &amp; LeBron James are more famous than any other NFL player right now.  Not to mention the NBA has big brand teams that dominate the overseas market like Rockets, Lakers, Warriors etc"
"Lmao project fucking more haha hahahaha I hate redditors, this is what they do. Talk when they don’t know what they’re talking about  Lebrons an idol to a lot of young Chinese. Plenty of them are disillusioned with the way things are but obviously don’t want to lose their organs. Lebron saying something while not causing direct change could help catalyze a change in opinion of the population of China. I’ve talked to students here from China as well as people still living in China about this to an extent. It’s a culture war. They’ve been fighting smart because most people in the US don’t understand that it’s happening. If LeBron James comes out and says “I respect the people of China and their long and storied culture, but what the CCP is doing is shameful to all of China and is a violation of human rights” that’s a small nuke in the culture war."

"The simple problem with NBA reffing is anyone who watches the games can see that star players are officiated with a different set of rules as everyone else. This means that: 1. There is a league mandate to do it.  2. Refs have relationships with the better players and subconsciously ref em different. 3. Refs have more motivation to call the game differently on stars from external forces other than the internal NBA ratings. (Ie. A bad call that cost lebron James a win is leading sportscenter, a bad call that costs the Magic a win is ignored)  I believe option 1 used to be the case, there are plenty of stories about Stern and the refs from the Bird /Magic era, I hope it's still not true, but I dont trust the NBA a ton on that. Option 2 I dont believe, because I have seen some players get star calls from day 1. Option 3 is most likely and would be the reason to fine refs, to change the source of motivation.    However, I don't think you can fine refs on a per play basis. You could change it to whatever % of correct calls is obtainable, but is higher than the average now gets a bonus. However you would need an actual honest evaluation of the reffing for that,meaning L2M reports aren't honest. Meaning if you read them you notice they give the benefit of the doubt to the call on the floor. So if a foul is called they look for any reason to validate the call, ie. Player As pinky grazed the arm of player B after the block good call on a foul. Same play not called a foul, player A didnt change speed or direction of ball handler with incidental and minimum contact good call!"
op thinks lebron james is above everyone in this world. if anything lebron would do exactly the opposite what op is suggesting.
"""Here is the part where I will act like an 11 year old was better than Lebron James at certain aspects of basketball."""
"I think the idea he should be “woke” and idealistic instead of pragmatic is I think a fundamentally bad take.   Look, neither of us know the man, but I personally feel he would be fine losing a few million dollars, but he knew that speaking out would fundamentally cost other people their jobs and livelihoods, it’d put the nba and Nike in a really bad position because China could easily cancel NBA broadcasts and that would cost everybody who works the league and most of the players who are not getting paid his kind of money, and for all we know, China could seize Nikes factories and all of this would cost a lot of people money, and most of them are not Lebron James who could easily make that money back with an ad or a couple sponsorships, and still nothing would change on the ground in China.  That’s my personal belief but like I said I don’t know him, and let’s not forget when he made the comments, he and his teammates were in China and people have said they were worried about their safety and I can fully believe that."
"For sure. He's one of the best scorers we've ever seen and clearly a top 3 player in the NBA if you ask me.  My question was what he meant by another level though - not if he can hoop. Did he mean another level compared to himself a few years ago? Another level compared to other elite NBA players? Maybe offensively, but overall James Harden is not on another level compared to players like Giannis, LeBron and Kawhi."
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-02-24/kobe-bryant-memorial-celebrities-jimmy-kimmel%3F_amp%3Dtrue  According to LA Times, “Among the Lakers-related faces in the audience: Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O’Neal, Phil Jackson, Jerry West, Rick Fox and LeBron James.”"
"&gt;LeBron James is so good just having him on your team makes you an instant contender (ie his first time in Cleveland and especially his 2018 and 2007 runs)  &gt;Disparity in talent. The east has almost always had less starpower across teams leading to it being very top heavy, having very few actually contending teams (excluding whatever team LeBron was on)  The East is far more competitive now for reasons more than just LeBron leaving, there's more starpower (still not as much as the West but it's certainly a lot more), and at least 5-6 teams that have a chance of actually winning"
"Whatever the case may be about the post, D Wade is not Lebron James, and D Wade knows that. Everyone handles things differently."
"""I grew up watching him, admiring him. It's just so surreal for me."" -- Lebron James, on Kobe Bryant"
"&gt; LeBron went to 8 straight Finals, of course he was at the top that long  LOL went to 8 straight finals playing in the weak East doesn't mean squat. His team would've lost to the 2nd round most years in the West. That's your shittiest argument yet. Jason Kidd went to back-to-back finals in 2002-2003 because the East was garbage. Was he in the discussion as best player back then? Gimme a break! You're either a LeBron fangirl or didn't live through that era.  &gt; Shaq got swept by Duncan in the second round of the '99 playoffs, the fifth time in O’Neal’s six playoff years his season had ended in a sweep. He was not better than Timmy that year.  Tim had David Robinson who was still an all-star level player, veteran supporting cast (Sean Elliott, Terry Porter, Avery Johnson, etc), and elite coach Popovich. Shaq had 20 year old Kobe and Kurt Rambis. Big difference.  &gt; Garnett had one year at the top, 2004. He never reached those heights ever again. Kobe, Dirk, and LeBron all exceeded him in the following years. Even Nash.  His supporting cast sucked both before and after 2004. 2004 was the ONLY year he had any help. Before 2004, his 2nd best player was Szczerbiak and Troy Hudson (ROFL). By 2006, his 2nd best player was Ricky Davis (LMFAO). Try winning with that roster. I don't care if it's Duncan, Dirk, LeBron, Nash, or Kobe (Kobe didn't win shit between Shaq and Pau Gasol either); you're not winning shit with Szczerbiak/Troy Hudson/Ricky Davis as your 2nd star. Pound for pound, KG was better than Duncan every year from 2002-2007. Numbers don't lie. Tapes don't lie. Put him in on the Spurs and put Duncan on the Wolves those years and the Spurs get slightly better and Wolves slightly worse. Duncan had way better teams and coaches. I'm strictly talking Duncan vs. Garnett, so I'm not involving Dirk, James, and Kobe in this discussion.  &gt; Malone was a playoff underperformer.   Back-to-back finals in 1997 and 1998 make him a playoff underperformer? Gimme a break!  &gt; Pat was always behind D-Rob, Shaq, and Hakeem.  No, he wasn't. He was clearly ahead of young Shaq and was always the #1 center in the East until Alonzo Mourning replaced him in the late '90s. Young Shaq never leapfrogged Ewing in the center pecking order before he left for the West in 1996.  &gt; Hakeem won championships because Jordan was not in the league.   They sucked in the regular season in one of those champion years (6th seed in the West). They peaked at the right time and he had veteran supporting cast. Doesn't mean he was the best individual player."
That’s also two other great turnaround guys that I think of when it comes to signature shots. Idk how I didn’t think of Dirk and the one leg fade-away immediately but there’s another guy I think of.   Lebron James simply isn’t who I think of when I think of turnaround jumper. He’s used it to great success in small sample sizes but I just don’t think it’s a signature shot of his.
"I mean look at how good the Lakers were last year. With LeBron James. 37 wins. If you can believe a team with LeBron James wins 37, then you can believe a team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis wins 45, especially Factoring in LeBron's struggles at the end of the previous season after the injury and the fact that he's like three years older than most players are when they retire."
"I mean it's just stupid to bet on a 35 year-old player not getting markedly worse. I don't care if he's LeBron James. I don't care if he seemed to defy aging previous seasons.   LeBron have looked vulnerable after getting hurt. I still think like 50 wins was a reasonable expectation. So far, LeBron has been remarkably healthy and remarkably productive. Davis is also exceeded expectations in terms of healthiness and Dwight Howard has had an insane come back year. Just because a prediction is wrong doesn't mean that methodology was wrong. Sometimes it's just unpredictable random chance, especially when your prediction is based on humans.  The Lakers were particularly vulnerable to variance because they were so top-heavy. If LeBron and Davis had healthy years, you might predict 20 more wins and if they had somewhat unhealthy years... Nevermind a serious injury keeping one of them out like 40 games... It's not a crazy thing to happen to a 35 year old player."
"That's his wishes which is fine and more power to him, but what I don't understand others here saying it would take away from the moment by even showing him on camera. Ain't like he's the only celebrity who was there, I didn't catch the whole service as I was at work but even at the tail end I saw shots of Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Magic Johnson, even Kanye West was in attendance.  So you can show every other celebrity in the entire arena for 3 seconds and its fine and not a distraction, but you show Lebron and it's an issue. Makes no sense to me. It's not like if they showed him for 5 seconds during the three hour run time that it would take away from the event, y'all need to stop yourselves."

Bronny has had Lebron James Sr teaching him how to play basketball his whole life.. that actually matters
Right now he projects around the 25th best player in his class and generally those guys at least get a shot in the NBA. He’s a freshman so a ton can change between now and graduation but yes he projects to be good enough.  That said he is nowhere near his hype that comes with being named LeBron James Jr.
"Well there are seniors on his team that are older and better than Bronny. He's still so young, it's too early to evaluate his upside. He doesn't need to be the next Lebron James."

"I am familiar with Lebron endorsing Hillary. And I completely agree. I wouldn't vote for Hillary because I think she is emblematic of some of the most toxic elements of our political process, as is Donald Trump. I would not vote for Lebron James.  You're the one out here citing made up illnesses as a cringy talking point because you're consumed by ideology and tribalism"
"Many phrases and sayings have become commonplace among American team sports, particularly in youth settings. ""There is no I in team"" is one of the sayings. Basically meaning how we're all in this together and no individual is more important than the team as a whole. When you play with the team it's not about you blah blah blah.  However, a perceptive individual may notice that the word 'team' does contain the letters 'M' and 'E' used to spelled 'me' the first-person objective based pronoun. The words 'I' and 'me' share the common function of referring to oneself via speech or writing and are utilized in different grammatical contexts.   One common rejoinder for the all too middle school coach proveb ""there is no I in team"" has been ""but there is in win"". This is basically an acknowledgement that it may be in the teams best interest to become individual oriented if victory is the ultimate objective. This is the classic ""LeBron + scrubs"" lineup that dominated the league in the mid 00's. If equal usage was given to each player on the 04 Cavs they would have been fucking awful. By putting their best player (Lebron James) in a position to succeed by putting the ball in his hands they increase their chances to win.  Kobe's rejoined the team proverb with ""but there's a motherfucking M and an E"". Basically saying there is a 'me' or an 'I' in team. The point Kobe was likely making the statement that sacrificing his individual opportunities on the court was not conducive to winning basketball.  The reason it's humorous is somewhat layered between Kobe's historic obsessive drive to win and his immediate comeback to an adage that is mainly centered around good sportsmanship."
"People in the distant future: ""Did you know that before LeBron James was a billionaire, philanthropist, Nobel laureate President, he was a very good basketball player?"
"Unless your names Lebron James, in which case it’s basically automatic and unguessable."
Is Lebron James a car mechanic?
"THE WEARY GROUP trudged across the tarmac and onto the team plane at Philadelphia International Airport. Ad  Awaiting the Los Angeles Lakers at the end of their 10-day, five-game road trip was a cross-country trek back to L.A., with an 11 a.m. ET departure time allowing for a 2:05 p.m. PT scheduled arrival time. This meant their Sunday was supposed to be salvaged by some semblance of an off day in Southern California, after touring through Houston, Boston, New York and Philly amid the chill that comes with late January in the Northeast.  The traveling party filed in -- broadcasters, media relations and team support staff in the back; coaching staff, training staff and players in separate sections going from tail to cockpit. It was one of those flights where those in window seats pulled the shades down as soon as they sat down, looking to doze off before the plane even took off.  But not everyone could sleep.  A few hours into the flight, as the plane hovered above the Midwest, Lakers coach Frank Vogel's face was lit by the glow of a screen as he pored over game tape from the team's 108-91 loss to the 76ers the night before.  The poor performance had soured a night in which LeBron James had eclipsed Kobe Bryant for No. 3 on the all-time NBA scoring list -- in Bryant's hometown, no less. Robert Hanashiro/USA TODAY Sports  As Vogel watched clip after clip of the Sixers dismantling his squad, he was approached by Lakers director of media relations Alison Bogli. She had seen a news report on her phone: Kobe Bryant had died in a helicopter accident.  ""There was that uncomfortable time, feeling like, 'This is a crazy report,'"" Vogel says. ""Like, 'This is not true. There's no way.' My expectation was to hear that it was a false report.""  Bogli, whose Lakers career dates back to the late 1990s, was texting with team personnel back in California, trying to gather information. It wasn't long, sources say, before Lakers controlling owner and president Jeanie Buss replied. It was true. Kobe was gone.  ""That's when I decided if it's 100 percent true, then [the players are] all seeing reports and wondering,"" Vogel says. ""I felt like, as their coach, as their leader, I just instinctually felt like they should hear it from me immediately.""  MORE: Stories from those close to Kobe  ANTHONY DAVIS WAS another restless passenger.  ""I can't sleep on planes, and I'm watching my iPad,"" Davis says.  Out of the corner of his eye, the Lakers' star big man saw a phone screen flash in one of the rows surrounding him -- a sign of activity amid the slumbering basketball squad, but nothing noteworthy enough to call his attention away from ""Avengers: Endgame.""  Only the activity grew.  When Davis next glanced away from his screen, his eyes focused on Dwight Howard and DeMarcus Cousins, waving their hands in his direction, their urgency muted by Davis' noise-canceling headphones.  ""So I remove one of my headphones, and I look,"" Davis says. ""And Dwight tells me, 'Man, Kobe died.' And me thinking as invincible as Kobe Bryant is, I'm like, 'Kobe who?' Because I'm like, that's not -- it's not Kobe Bryant.  ""And he was like, 'Kobe.' And I was like, 'OK. Kobe who? I'm not sure who you're talking about.' And he was like, 'Kobe Bryant.' And at this time, Bron is still asleep. So I was like, 'Wait, what? How? Like, I need details, like, tell me.' And he was like, 'Man, helicopter crash.'""  Davis jostled the resting James.  ""And I just like, start shaking Bron, like, 'Wake up! Wake up!'""  The players section, quiet moments ago, began to stir, members of the team scrambling to log on to the in-flight Wi-Fi.  ""By this time, all the players have woken up,"" Davis says. ""Everybody's trying to get to the internet to get on their phone and see what's going on. 'Is it true?' Or, 'What's going on?'""  ""It didn't hit me. So I turned my Wi-Fi on just to see,"" Lakers guard Quinn Cook said on the Inside the Green Room podcast, hosted by fellow L.A. guard Danny Green. ""I got 200 messages. Twitter is just going crazy.""  Jared Dudley, from the air, became the first member of the organization to comment on the tragedy.  Meanwhile, James, like Davis and Vogel before him, could not accept what he was hearing.  ""I remember the first thing Bron said to me was, 'Man, y'all stop playin -- like, stop playing with me,'"" Davis says. ""And I'm trying to get on the internet. And Dwight, like, you can see him start crying. He was like, 'It's true.'""  For Howard, whose first stint playing for the Lakers had been marred by a rocky relationship with Bryant, the emotions came swift and hard.  ""It was like a movie scene when it happened,"" he says. ""I was extremely hurt.""  Howard folded his 6-foot-10, 265-pound frame into the nearest bathroom stall. And there the big man began to weep.  IN 2011, PHIL HANDY, a respected player-development trainer, had joined the Lakers' coaching staff after carving out a career playing internationally. He had been part of the team of trainers tasked with the job of keeping Bryant's battered body running through the end of his career.  After working in similar roles on the Cleveland Cavaliers' championship team alongside James in 2016 and with the Toronto Raptors' title team alongside Kawhi Leonard in 2019, Handy was hired back by the Lakers last summer as an assistant coach under Vogel -- no longer just a workout guru, but a trusted voice in team strategy.  Vogel woke Handy up on the plane to let him know what had happened to Bryant.  ""I looked at Frank, and I almost fell out of my seat,"" Handy recalled on the Inside the Green Room podcast. ""It's one of those things you can never be prepared for. It's not what you expect when you wake up. Just the last thing; your mind is not even there.  ""I got up and went to the bathroom, and Kyrie [Irving] started calling me. He called me about 10 times, and I couldn't pick up the phone. I knew he was crushed.""  Even if Handy had been able to hold it together enough to talk to Irving -- who considered Bryant a mentor and who was coached by Handy in Cleveland -- there was no use trying to ring the Brooklyn Nets guard. When your plane is nearly 38,000 feet in the air, there's no cell service to make a call.  With information still sparse and calls impossible, some members of the broadcast crew in the back of the plane had logged on to the Delta app to stream live television coverage of the crash.  When a member of the team's security, who had worked with Bryant both when he was a player and during his post-playing days, heard that the helicopter had come down in Calabasas, California, he thought of the familiar flight route from Bryant's home in Newport Beach to his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks. His mind darted to Bryant's daughter Gianna and her typical weekend games at the facility, fearing the worst.  Vogel, through Bogli, knew the painful details when he approached the players: Kobe, Gigi and seven other victims had been lost forever.  ONE BY ONE, the coach made his way through his players to deliver the incomprehensible news.  ""It was just a daunting task of just grabbing each guy one-on-one and letting him know,"" Vogel says.  Some players had already discussed the report as Vogel came to verify it.  ""Everybody was crying,"" Davis says. ""It was just like something that we didn't believe, something that was shocking to all of us. Because Kobe, he's touched so many, you know -- players on this team, staff members. You know, Judy [Seto], his trainer; Rob [Pelinka, his] agent; Robert Lara, security. He touched so many people.""  James, who had fielded a congratulatory phone call from Bryant that very morning before boarding, gathered the players together.  In the same spot on the plane -- among the mismatched blue and maroon vinyl seats -- where the players had posed for a group photo after a perfect December road trip had pushed their record to 20-3, the group embraced.  James, who had scribbled ""Mamba 4 Life"" on his sneakers the night before, led the team in prayer.  ""It was just off the top off my head, just off the cuff,"" James says. ""I think it was needed for us to come together and just give thanks to the man above.  ""Even though at times we question him and question why he do some of the things that he do, know that he's never made a mistake. And just hope that he has his hands on top of Vanessa [Bryant] and the kids at that time, and hope that he continues to watch over all of us. So, I don't know, it wasn't something I thought about. It was something that just kind of came to me, and I said my piece.""  IF NOT FOR an emphasis on sleep science, the Lakers would have already been in L.A. and dispersed back to their individual homes by the time Bryant's helicopter went down. Only recently has the team started staying overnight at the end of a road trip.  And so they were all together with more than two hours of flight time to go once the initial report had pinged on Bogli's phone.  The remainder of the trip was enveloped by what one passenger describes as ""suffocating silence,"" outside of the sounds of muffled tears.  As the plane continued west, Cook scrolled through his photo archive, trying to find snapshots of him and Bryant together. Handy says he spent nearly an hour in the bathroom before emerging.  The pain was palpable for everyone on board. Some found purpose in comforting others -- particularly someone like Seto, whose ties to Bryant ran deep.  But all they knew, for sure, was that they would land into a world that was irreversibly changed.  ""We were just like, we just need to get off this plane,"" Davis says. ""We just want to get off the plane. And be with your families and, you know, just get back home."""
"They'll probably win 60 games because LeBron James is arguably the greatest offensive engine in the history of basketball. The team is a dumpster fire without him even with LA's other ""superstar"" on the court."
"Sexton bad upvotes to the left  We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Sexton.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched The young bull in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Sextons game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Collin Sexton, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Sexton in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Sexton is better.  You might be jealous of Sextons swag, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Cavs fan who watched basketball in the 2010s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Sexton isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the sexton talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Drive and bucket everytime, 0 rim protection vs LeBron James sheesh"
The Grizzlies will not be signing LeBron James
"Even the 2008-09 Cavs, which had a significantly better defense than the 2009-10 team, wasn't an all-time great defensive team. Those teams had a great defense but were by no means ""stacked."" LeBron James was 100% of their offense and they would have sucked without him."
"We should ban Nick Wright's name from this sub. His last tweet before Kobe's death was to trash Kobe to make Lebron look better. He's a fucking bitch who does nothing else than suck Lebron'd dick, and he will talk nothing but bad about you if your name isn't Lebron James."
"&gt;Lebron James carried the Miami Heat in ‘13 and ‘14   &gt;   &gt;Steph Curry benefitted more from KD going to the Warriors than KD did  Wait... how are these unpopular? Wade's knees could barely hold out in '13 and '14.   And yeah Curry benefitted more, he basically got 2 more guaranteed rings out of the whole ordeal while getting to take a back seat. The entire time the media and fans tore KD apart lol. Thing is you can't question Steph's rings like KD's because he's proven to have been able to win beforehand."
With the pass that hit LeBron James... I know it was Rondo. I just know.
"&gt; concrete evidence that Ayton has a higher ceiling than Giannis.  Give me concrete evidence that Lebron James is better than Alex Caruso. Give me ""irrefutable evidence"" that Zion Williamson has more potential than Derrick Williams. There is no ""irrefutable evidence"" or a single objective number other than comparing the production of players. You compare the production of two players and see how players improve and project it based on how much produce and how much they are improving. To say something as stupid as 2nd year production has no barring on potential is the stupidest thing I have ever heard."
If you're compared to LeBron fucking James in your scouting report then you better believe that Zion is a generational talent.

"Question is obviously magic, but I looked into and surprisingly few NBA draft picks have won a title. So fastest to win for a #1 pick (starting 50 drafts ago)  Year they won in     * Year 1: Magic Johnson * Year 2: Tim Duncan * Year 3: Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Bill Walton, James Worthy, * Year 5: Kyrie Irving * Year 8: Shaquille O'Neal,  * Year 9: Mychael Thompson, Mark Aguirre, Lebron James, * Year 10: Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Andrew Bogut,  * Year 11: Glenn Robinson * Never won: Bob Lanier, Austin Carr, Larue Martin, Doug Collins, David Thompson, John Lucas, Kent Benson, Joe Barry Carroll, Ralph Sampson, Patrick Ewing, Brad Dougherty, Pervis Ellison, Derrick Coleman, Larry Johnson, Chris Webber, Joe Smith, Allen Iverson, Michael Olowakandi, Elton Brand, Kenyon Martin, Kwame Brown, Yao Ming, Dwight Howard, Andrea Bargnani, Greg Oden, Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin, John Wall, Anthony Davis, Anthony Bennett, Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns, Ben simmons, Markelle Fultz, Deandre Ayton, Zion Williamson  &amp;#x200B;  So only 14 of the last 40 #1 picks actually won titles, and a few had to do it while no longer being stars (or in the case of Glenn Robinson, a very deep bench guy).   Dwight and AD have a shot this year, with a longer shot for Simmons. Wiggins might be able to if the Warriors round back into form next year."
True but you had people saying James Jones was colluding with lebron to give him for free
"I think you're underrating the 2013 Heat. 2013 Heat were obliterating teams in the reg season too. 27 win streak. Also, as I said, the Heat had a lot of 3 point shooter. Ray Allen, top 3 3 point shooter of all time and extremely clutch. Shane Battier, Mike Miller, Mario Chalmers. Lebron James was also a 40 percent three point shooter that season too. So they had enough 3 point shooters to keep up with them. Lebron was also the runner up for defensive player of the year. 2016 Lebron was blocked like 5 Curry shots in that 2016 finals. Imagine 2013 Lebron. Great perimeter defensive team. I think it would be a good series but 2012-2013 Heat would win."
He's Lebron James...anything involving basketball is his bread and butter.   ...besides free throws
Technically you could say Lebron never won a ring without James Jones

"&gt;Giannis says fuck you lol  Oh shit, I forgot about Giannis Antetokounmpo there. I wasn't really thinking of Giannis as a ""big man"", but more like a wing since he handles the ball a lot kind of like LeBron James. That's why I didn't mention Giannis Antetokounmpo as the best big man in the NBA lol my bad. But yeah, if Giannis counts as a big man, then he's definitely the best with Anthony Davis as the 2nd best in my opinion lol"
"&gt;Nuggets would definitely be worse with AD instead of Jokic. Lakers I think would be better with Jokic.  Well, the Denver Nuggets are built around Nikola Jokic's strengths, so that's not a totally fair comparison. Also, the Lakers most likely wouldn't be better with Nikola Jokic instead of Anthony Davis, since Anthony Davis is the anchor of the Lakers defense. We all saw what Anthony Davis did to Nikola Jokic defensively in those 2 games in Denver as well. LeBron James was basically hunting Nikola Jokic in the pick and roll at the end of the 4th quarter and in overtime with Anthony Davis in the latest Lakers/Nuggets game. You can't really hunt Anthony Davis like that on defense lol  Nikola Jokic's playmaking ability is definitely better than Anthony Davis's playmaking ability though lol"

&gt; I like that you're downvoted for saying how it is. LeBron James is a top 5 player easily and had ridiculous success. Trying to downplay his career and ability to prop Magic Johnson up is pathetic.
"They've got 1450 combinded career starts to Lebron's 1250 career starts.  If you look at it from just Harden's Rockets tenure because that's when he became a full-time starter, it looks like this.  |Rk|Player|Count| |-:|:-|-:| |1|James Harden|255| |2|LeBron James|252| |3|Russell Westbrook|225| |4|Kevin Durant|162| |5|Giannis Antetokounmpo|114|"
TIL LeBron James is good at the sport of basketball
"What's your argument? Jordan has 6 rings? Lebron would've won 8+ rings with those Bulls teams, especially against the teams that Jordan played in the finals. Hence the reason they never even had to play a game 7.   Nobody in history has elevated his teammates more than Lebron James... and yes, longevity is a big fucking deal.   How'd your guy do with his second team?"
I like that you're downvoted for saying how it is. Magic Johnson is a top 5 player easily and had ridiculous success. Trying to downplay his career and ability to prop Lebron James up is pathetic.

"And not to be a homer but agreed. I can only imagine how pissed the league was that Portland beat the Lakers in their “comeback” game after Kobe. You *know* that wasn’t the intended outcome.  Similar to the Player of the Month pre ASG.

Proud of Romeo today I can't believe he's been tasked with LeBron James of all people in one of his first real games.
Do you really think Lebron James would shove a ref on national television over this?

"There was a significant swath of fans out there like me at the time who weren't fans of the contested iso mid-range game that many superstars favored at the time. This was part of the reason I was so excited for LeBron James' entrance into the league, as he seemed to be a superstar who valued playing the game more closely to how I felt it should be played.   I used to be endlessly flummoxed with stars that'd look off their wide-open sharpshooting teammates so they could take contested faders over triple teams in the clutch."
Do you think lebron James isn’t capable of pushing around a ref?

follow the lakers to see the swan song of the greates olayer of this century so far (lebron james) so you can say you watched him  also okc for chris paul twilight to a lesser extent  doncic is cool and mavs usually have fun teams  sixers have great olayers yet are so disfunctional every game feels like a toss up  boston/denver/miami/raptors all have good teams that cam be enjoyable
I love his reasoning    They traded IT and didnt sign him   Where was he traded before becoming a free agent?  To lebron james cavs where he was famously mocked and left out of team shit and then to ADs franchise of choice the lakers were he was not given a league minimum to come back when they signed lebron.....

Daily Discussion Thread : [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/wiki/rules#wiki_daily_discussion_thread)"
"Not even shitting on him but he really sounds like Giannis is the first star he's seen get this good in his career.   Hell, I've seen the rise of the newer batch of stars from OK3-Splash-Dame and none of them gave the vibe of a sure all time great like LeBron did. KD and Steph really developed into fucking monsters and clawed their way into the top 20-25 tho. Even Russ and Harden kept evolving and had historic seasons of their own. But in terms of ""all time"" tier, Giannis hasn't really shown a new level of dominance.   Peak chonk dominant Shaq, mid 2000s scoring monster Kobe, quiet consistent winning Duncan, Cavs King James were all still on another tier. Giannis right now is on the tiers of MVP KG-Nash. All Time greats but not top 10 vibes.   Luka dominating like this in his 2nd season is a bit closer to showing top 10 potential. Giannis can still do a lot more tho but as of now, it's a no."
"What are you talking about? The nba has always been about narrative. It’s never not about the narrative. You don’t win the mvp for being the best, you win it for having the best story.   Take Nash’s back to back mvps for example. Nash won his second mvp in ‘06 with 18.8 ppg, 10.5 apg, 4.2 rpg with the team finishing slightly worse than the year before. Doing this he beat out:   Dwyane Wade: 27.2 ppg, 6.7 apg, 5.7 rpg. Dirk Nowitzki: 26.6 ppg, 2.8 apg, 9 rpg. LeBron James: 31.4 ppg, 6.6 apg, 7 rpg. Kobe Bryant: 35.4 ppg, 4.5 apg, 5.3 rpg  My point is that this has been the case in the nba for a very very long time."
"I bet OP wanted to name the title “Harden-Giannis” but then realized how that would be “last name-first name” so then he/she thought about “James-Giannis” but then people might think of LeBron instead, so maybe go with “Harden-Antetokounmpo” but that would make the title look too wordy—plus, mostly everyone refers to him iconically as Giannis, so let’s settle with “James Harden-Giannis” even though we’re only using the full name for one of the players God damn I am so faded rn"
Ben Simmons is the next LeBron James.
"His unique skillset is being long as hell, long strides, long arms and hes explosive, dont get me wrong he's skilled(the conventional definition) for his size  but his athleticism is what puts him ahead.   There sure as hell is reason to assume he wouldnt be as skilled as THE GOAT. Or Lebron James, or James Harden, jesus."
Imagine Rihanna acknowledging you only because Lebron James decided to dip his nuggets in your hartsauce
"yes, it is. Curry and Giannis are going to have two MVPs, not to mention LeBron fucking James is in the league."
"Ah yes, those famous role players Kawhi Leonard and Lebron James"
"What if I told you, that the Golden State Warriors would be led to the promise Land with Stephen Curry. Then it took a 73-9 season with the greatest performance from LeBron James, a player better than Jordan potentially, and a string of bad luck to defeat them. However I'm not done yet, Kevin Durant, a Wilt Chamberlain with a 3 and skinny frame at SF to join us and defeat LeBron James back to back. I still can't imagine it"
[LeBron James will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8k8wej/why_lebron_would_sign_with_every_nba_team/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
"Damn, I remember watching that All-Star draft thing with him and LeBron and Chuck was the guy who started the joke about James and Giannis expanded it. I mean, I know he was joking around and he obviously probably wasn’t planning for him to be on his team for his own reasons. It didn’t seem malicious at all."
"You wanted Giannis to say  ""We wanted to avoid 7x all defense Chris Paul, 2x DPOY Kawhi Leonard, 6x all defense Lebron James, and 3x all defense AD. So we went to whoever James Harden was guarding"" ?  Or just say what it is ""We went at whoever James Harden was guarding"" since the entire paragraph above that is implied already by him saying that they targeted Harden"
You don't  get to flop and cry for a foul every 3 point shot or drive and get to call yourself the greatest. I've never been lulled to sleep by Lebron James. Harden though....
"Media: what was the game plan at the end?  Giannis: to avoid 7x all defense Chris Paul, 2x DPOY Kawhi Leonard, 6x all defense Lebron James, and 3x all defense AD. Instead we wanted to to go at James harden.   Harden: shocked pikachu face"
"This guy LeBron James gave us so many nightmares. Also, we picked Marvin Williams over Chris Paul in the 2005 draft."
"2016 Curry? You know, ""Unanimous MVP Curry""? The year where James Harden took 9th in overall voting with 9 points or 0.7% of the possible points? Are you really that stupid?  Harden deserved the won he won, a strong argument that he deserved the one Russ got. That's it, he's not LeBron who deserves at least three more MVPs than he has. He won once, was probably shafted once and lost to someone a little better than him every other time."
"There is this guy named Lebron James who controls the league, people always compare him to MJ but he always loses to the Warriors. Shaq and Kobe also won, then split up and Kobe won more."
"That's because everybody load manages. Nobody plays, everybody just sits out so they can stay healthy for their next contract. Zion III and LeBron James IV are each getting ready to sign 4 year, $500 million extensions, both having combined for 0 games played."
2008 Celtics v. Cavs.  You get the best in game dunk of all time (LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE!!!!) and the incredible game 7 from that series with 45 from LeBron &amp; 41 for Paul Pierce

*LeBron James has entered the chat*
Andrew Wiggins to Lebron James
"&gt; Harden knows he’s a shit passer   People literally don't watch basketball on this subreddit just unbelievable that somebody really said that seriously.    James Harden isn't a Luka, Lebron, CP3 level all time great passer but he is easily a top 10 passer in the league"
It's LeBron James. The only kid I know who had high school games airing on ESPN and now it happens to his son too. He's the reason many people even have jobs in basketball media
LeBron James gave Josh Hart depression
"&gt; Perhaps people don't care enough to spend time responding to the same ""hArDeN dOeSn'T pLaY d"" argument that plays out on nearly every thread.  So now you're arguing that that defense isn't a factor? That's total bullshit.    &gt; There are many reasons why Giannis was and deserved MVP, but you can't pretend there aren't reasons why Harden deserved it too.  The literal comment was ""if James Harden was actually named Lillard, Lebron, Kyrie, etc last year, he would’ve won.""  Why would someone like Harden (but not Harden) certainly would have won (exactly as stated in the quote)?   There are essentially two things voters look at. Stats and win. Giannis was clearly ahead of the wins and the stats were comparable with Giannis ahead on advance stats. So again, I ask.....why would anyone in Harden's situation for sure have won it?   And if you don't think wins matter THAT much, just look at the year before. None other than James Harden. But  he won because the Rockets had 65 wins (vs 53 the next year) despite his stats not being as good his MVP year compared to last year."
"Yeah it's basically a more skilled Lebron James.  But this ""if such player gained half a foot!"" (as if you edited their height in 2K) argument is always rubbish. Obviously they wouldn't play that way with a completely different body. What's impressive about players like Lebron or Giannis (and even Harden to some extent, think about all the sluggish gangly awkward 6'5 guys you've met) has always been that they combine physical size and athleticism and skill all in high enough amount that they will outdo anything a 6ft guy might produce on the court. Even someone as skilled as CP3.  The converse is equally as dumb. Like, I'm sure a small 6'3 version of Lebron isn't anything to be excited about, but you're not really saying anything interesting."
"His defense is 10x times better than curry. Without KD, Curry is just another choker with a lucky ring beating trashcans and Lebron James."
"My advice, as simple as this may sound, is to try to find a game to watch live. Go search YouTube for highlights of players you might find exciting - like Zion Williamson or Greek Freak or LeBron James - and then make a plan to watch them live, in action on TV or on your computer. And then the more times you do that, the more you'll gradually begin to understand the rules of the game better and you'll begin to truly love it. You just gotta take that first step though and watch a full game"
"They run the LeBron James play, he does awesome shit and people get dunks and threes."
Isn’t that kinda like Lebron James?
Y’all haven’t made the playoffs in decade and missed the playoffs last year with LeBron fuckin James on your team. Don’t throw stones from a glass house.
"&gt; The NBA has missed him. There’s no shortage of the spectacular when LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and—let’s not waste our time; the list is long—are playing each night; still, there’s no replacing Curry. We spent years calling Golden State unwatchable because the Warriors were too good, but when you did tune in, Curry put a temporary plug on your complaints. Chances are you’ve seen him break a record live, or at the very least, come close. Curry’s scurries and flurries are one of the most entertaining themes the NBA has to offer. He’s known for his efficiency, but what comes before the shot is hardly efficient. Curry doesn’t go from Point A to Point B on a drive; he loops around defenders, rocks, swings, doubles back, and crosses Go before laying it in. It’s like he’s spitballing, like his body’s incessant flailing is buying time for his mind to make the right move. Sometimes he pulls up from 30 feet or half court or Napa Valley, and it never gets to that point. And then he winks, as if we’re all old friends.  &gt; I still think of Curry as part of the new wave of NBA. He’s 31, and he’s no unicorn, but he is the godfather of a very specific type of basketball, the egregiously deep shooting, improvisational, dancing, prancing sort of guard bleeding into the league. We’ve grieved Curry’s loss all season, but he’s been here. In Trae Young, Buddy Hield, Devin Booker, and many more household names to be."
"Giannis deserves it this year. But I’ll put it to you like this, if James Harden was actually named Lillard, Lebron, Kyrie, etc last year, he would’ve won."
&gt;Not to mention he’s one of the only star players that I’ve ever seen IMPROVE his scoring and efficiency in the postseason.   Ever heard of a guy named Kawhi Leonard?   There were hundreds of posts last post season about how his % and scoring go way up.   https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaneyoung/2019/06/10/how-kawhi-leonards-playoff-dominance-is-rivaling-some-of-the-greatest/   I mean there's this other guy who is known for it too... LeBron James

I never fucking said I dislike the Celtics.   All three of my Celtics takes on my entire account are:  This one: Tatum is not Lebron James The last one: Tatum isn’t better than PG yet  And the one you are referring to: Trae is better than everyone under 21 years old outside of Luka.   Stop being a weirdo and tryna make it seem like I’m a Celtics haters when my posts are right there. Those are my three Celtics takes. You sound crazy stop LMAOO.
"Hmm I think Wade drive a lot more than Terry that series. Terry wasn't known as a slasher like Wade was and was significantly a smaller player under 200 lbs without explosive athleticism. Driving wasn't really his game, even in his Atlanta days when he should've been an all star. I mean he drove but he wasn't looking for contact being such a small guys. Guys like AI and Wade always took contact. Wade made plus defenders like Daniels, Stack, Griffin and other look like James Harden. Since his second season Wade had at least one or more 20 plus FT attempt games for like 6 or 7 straight years before the big 3 assembled. So Dallas wasn't his first time he took 20 plus free throws. And Dallas didn't really have the guys to stop him from penetrating that series. The narrative of refs gifting him free throws is kinda negated since Wade in the regular season has shot 16, 18 and 20+ attempts before his first finals appreance. I don't think any Heat fan was surprised by the FT numbers because of his relentless drives to the hope. He was a guard who didn't really shoot jumpers like that but he was actually hitting his jumpers and when that happens he's unguardable. Similar to when LeBron gets hot from outside during that time but a smaller version that weaves through defenders with great lateral mobility like a running back. I think people who didn't follow him every game and him being only in his 3rd year didn't realize how proficient he was at getting it the line. His knees definitely know this. He wasn't flopping like Harden, Tony Parker and Manu. He took flight and risked his body which in turn shortened his prime. Dallas even throw triple teams on him a few times. 3/5 defenders on the floor, that's crazy man. They're not gonna do that because the refs were rigging it. He got to the line because he was also getting buckets from the inside and outside. If you look at the points he didn't score from the line they were quite spectacular and like I said before the jumper was hitting. I hope this helps you understand what his game was like at the time better because he was only in his 3rd year. And don't forget the Heat almost beat the Pistons the year prior but Wade was injured one game and Miami couldn't recover. So he was already doing big things in the post seasons two straight years already. Wade in a losing effort averaged 33 points vs a big 3 Boston team who were better defensively with no help. But he had more help in 06.   But yeah I hope this clears things up for you. Luka is a beast and will probably cook the Heat tonight because we've been playing like ass lately. Makes me miss prime because our clutch play has been horrible these last few weeks 😔 have a great weekend bro. Ballislife ♥"
Shame on you for expecting unbiased conversation about Lebron from someone with a username kf Qing James
One's playing with Lebron James the other is playing with Troy Hudson
"Nah, the Cavs played LeBron, Tristan Thompson, Dellavadova, Mozgov, Shumpert, JR, James Jones, and sometimes Mike Miller.  TT, Mozgov, Shumpert, and JR were pretty good back then too."
"2013 James Harden - 26/5/6/2 on 60% TS. 78 games and a 43-35 record. in games he played  2019 Kyrie Irving - 24/5/7 on 59% TS. 67 games and a 37-30 record in games he played.  9 guys better than AD = Lebron, Harden, Russ, Dame, Giannis, Jokic, Kawhi, Steph, Embiid."

"In an era where 3 and D is so important from perimeter players and having both like Kawhi and Klay really are the type of players that help teams win games and all stars have at least one of them like Steph, LeBron, KD, Kobe etc. Luka has neither and his efficiency comes from flopping playstyle that doesn't translate well in playoffs like James Harden but at least he shot 3 at a higher percentage and is better on D."
"Like I pointed out.   The only exception was 2015. Every year since then we ran into a brick fucking wall. That brick wall also known as LeBron James.  It wouldn't have made much difference if we got swept or if we lost in 7. Our team was unable to break the hurdle, it'd be three years in a row LeBron broke off our hopes and dreams. You talk about the greatest team and I'm comparing it to the greatest player of all time. LeBron game 1 GSW (51-8-8) is evident that 1 dude almost singlehandedly beat your so-called best team ever right?  It doesn't matter the score either, two games were decided by a basket but mentally we already knew it was over. If people shit on the Raptors, I feel like Portland should equally get some criticisms. They got swept three straight years, two times in the first round even.  I'm pretty sure I can find a bunch of parallels. Why is Portland exempt to this criticism? Houston got shit on harder than Portland but yet they experienced the same predicament."
It was talked about in a book by Marcus Thompson called The miraculous rise of Steph Curry but these articles mention it   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-doesnt-like-stephen-curry-2017-4%3famp  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2702921-lebron-james-russell-westbrook-more-reportedly-hold-disdain-toward-steph-curry

"I don't care what you guys think. When someone averages 35/8/5 on 70TS%, then comes back next year to average 29/11/8 on 65TS% against a prime LeBron James you deserve your ring. Get outta here with that shit"
"oh yeah I'm with you  I'm just saying it's one to say we're chokers, trash bros, all that nonsense when you're literally playing against arguably the greatest player of all time.  I never watched Jordan play but LeBron ever since that '07 pistons OT 25 points in a row I'm pretty adamant we'll never see another player like LeBron period.  In a few years from now when we're much older, I swear the outlook on James Harden will be interesting. TV personalities are already calling him a choker and a chucker, if he doesn't win anything will people remember how dominating GSW is? No. James Harden will forever be known as a choker and it's unfair."
My only question is how much would a player like Lebron James get back on his taxes when he files?  I just got back $8000 on mine.lol
"Not to mention in between plays too. After Green hits the shot, the ideal nfl-style situation would be to bring the play back up on screen, maybe circle how James makes use of AD's presence and that spacing, or stop the clip at the perfect time so we see how James makes the pass just as Green's man is too far committed to recover. But by the time you come back from that, the opposing team would have already played out their possession.  The NBA is a weird sport where it's sometimes a chess game, but others not at all. Like, you can have a great defensive plan, perfect switches, the personnel, and then Harden or Lebron just shoots and scores. It's a chess game where a legitimate move is to just knock your opponents pieces off the board"
"I’m sick of people complaining about load management.  I have a list of why.    1.  You buy tickets to see the Lakers play the Mavericks.   You’re not buying tickets to the Lebron James show, you’re buying a ticket to see five people in Lakers uniforms play basketball against five people in Mavericks uniforms.  2.  Say your team is playing a great team who is resting their stars.  You should be happy that your team was getting a free win!  If you want to see the opposing team torch yours, you’re a plastic fan.  3.  Say you’re at a game where your team is resting a star.   This means your team is playoff bound.  If you’re actually a fan, you should want to be healthy enough for a playoff run."
"You are ridiculous if you think Durant is better than Bird or Duncan. Not only did Duncan and Bird actually earn those rings but they consistently played better in the playoffs and in birds case the regular season as well than durant.    Durant was a perennial  playoff underperformer before he joined a 73 win team while Duncan literally carried a team to a title and at his apex was the clear cut best player in basketball and one of the best defensive players ever.   Durant isn’t even close to either guy. I swear this sub dosen’t watch basketball. They see KDs highlights which look pretty because he is a 7 footer with sick handles and a jumper so they think he is basically a 2K Demi god but then you actually watch him before he joined a 73 win team and he is a dude that could go ice cold when teams were locked into defending him (like what happens to harden, Giannis. LeBron, etc every single game). He has always been a very poor rebounder for his size and he is HORRIBLE at boxing out and setting screens. He’s not a special playmaker like a lot of the other top elite level guys and he has consistently shown to be a player that can not overcome adversity in a playoff series. He wasn’t a leader who could inspire his teammate on or off the court to play better    KD peaked in 2012 at 23 years old. Every year after that he just under performed like he was James Harden or Karl Malone"
He's delusional? You think Lebron James is better than Michael Jordan. That's as delusional as it gets
Why the fuck would you run the offense through Anthony Davis when LeBron James is on the team? The Lakers are inept without LeBron. Davis can’t lead them to shit
"Okay, let's use this most accurate stat to compare some players:  * Brook Lopez &gt; LeBron James * Daniel Theis &gt; Kemba Walker * Patrick Beverley &gt; Nikola Jokic * Wesley Matthews &gt; Jayson Tatum  Sound about right, I'm sure you'll agree."
"Would LeBron or Giannis or James Harden be allowed to say ""and one"" when finishing a layup through contact?"
"Dirk carried his team to championship through a loaded west and crushed a loaded Miami heat lead by Lebron fucking James almost primarily on contested jump shots. He’s top ten all time and easily the best shooting big ever, even if not statistically"
"Smh Annoyed that people don’t respect him. You plug him into a real team and he’d be able to do exactly what other highly regarded lead guards do. I don’t think people realize how much green light, supporting cast, and perception matters.   Bc there’s NOT THAT MUCH separating a guy like Russell, who gets looked at with the side eye, vs say Kyrie, Kemba, etc. who are respected for their craft, multi all stars, and in Kyrie’s case due to sheer luck of playing with Lebron is a ‘champion’   At the end of the day they all do the same thing and that’s get buckets. Don’t tell me about his ‘defense’ when James Harden and Steph curry are universal icons for their OFFENSE (while playing passable defense at best)"
"I always love an opportunity to recycle my old comment about that one...  &gt;This was my least favorite Timberwolves game in recent memory.   &gt;Thibs *wanted* Butler isos against LeBron fucking James.  &gt;Jimmy took 8 of our last 10 shots. He went 3/8.   &gt;Either Thibs couldn't plan something better than ISOing against the best player this generation 8 out of 10 times, or Butler was too stubborn to acknowledge LeBron is a tough matchup.  &gt;Jimmy missed more shots in overtime than KAT missed the entire game. KAT had 30 points on 12 shots in regulation, and then didn't get a single attempt in the overtime."
"There has been talk about them getting more guys that have played with Lebron; like I know that we still could see playoff James, but I don't think they come out of the west. The Clippers are much better as a whole, The Nuggets are a sleeper team to watch out for, and the Rockets finally want to make a push."
LMAO I still remember capela getting a tech for hanging on the rim for literally like a second and someone on reddit placed a comparison of him next to Lebron James and lbj was still hanging on the rim when the rockets were arguing with the ref
"Though that's definitely a reason for his high +/-, have you watched him play much? I don't know if RAPTOR takes into account things that don't turn up in box scores but if you watch him play on a regular basis he's as legit a defender as they come right now but it's for a number of reasons, not just any one. He knows what the offense is going to do before they do it so he can position himself better than almost anyone before he's even part of the play. There are other reasons but I don't feel like typing them out. But other than him being sneaky athletic, his BBallIQ is seriously-impress-Lebron-James level high."
"I think Lebron can play 1-4 in any era and Larry cannot. I think Larry can shoot better than Lebron. They can do things the other cannot.   On balance I think Lebron is a better player and is in contention for the GOAT, it's not a knock on Bird to say that James is a better player."
LeBron or jaylen brown. I heard an nba player say James Jones would make a great president but i don’t remember who said it
He JUST misses my top 10 but it's debatable and we split hairs when it comes to the all time greats. I always hate posting a list because no one EVER agrees but maybe this is the time and place for it? Just keep in mind I'm a giant Celtics fan heavily influenced by Bill Simmons so I have bill Russell higher and Wilt lower than most.  1) Michael Jordan  2) LeBron James  3) Kareem  4) Bill Russell  5) Magic Johnson  6) Larry Bird  7) Wilt Chamberlain  8) Kobe Bryant  9) Tim Duncan  10) Shaq  11) Hakeem Olajuwon
LeBron 'Bronny' James Jr would like a word.
Lebron James had Josh Jackson’s posters on his wall
&gt; 99.99% chance  o look at mr lebron james over here
the supposed easiest thing on your list is something lebron james misses three out of every ten attempts  nobody would wager going a million dollars in debt no matter how good they are you dingus
"Nah, if I was starting a team for this one season as of today I'm picking LeBron Fucking James."
They were a bad team when LeBron was sitting on the bench. And immediately following his departure they became the worst team in the league. By this logic LeBron hasn't been on a bad team (where he's actually playing and healthy) since his 2nd season...coincidence? Or can we say the obvious which is they aren't bad because they have LeBron James?
Notorious LeBron James stopper  #JJ Barea
"Just to prove you wrong and the people downvoting my comment. There have only been 20 times a player has average 30pts/4reb/6ast per game. 5 of those times, the player has won MVP. List of players on that list: Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Rick Barry, Steph Curry, Dwyane Wade, Russell Westbrook and James Harden  So ya.. MVP numbers"
First i want to say i think Ja should win due to Zion missing so much time...But it not even close to the same thing. Embiid missed the END of the season and Zion missed the beginning. Finishing the season hot with momentum vs finishing injured is a big thing to voters. Zion is also the biggest media darling the NBA has seen since Lebron James. The media desperately wants to give Zion the award. They didn't with Embiid
Because they faced an even more talented trio in the finals? They lost to prime Lebron fucking James. It's not had to believe at all.
I like how the pocket team has only big dudes for 2. Do you realize Ben Simmons/**LeBron James**/Giannis are all bigger than any on the rockets' starting 5?
A top three team because of LeBron James. They might not even make the playoffs without him ‘cause Davis clearly can’t lead them to shit.
"Yeah, this sub can be pretty obnoxious at times lol.   It's become more and more common recently. Last year, Dwyane Wade (a legend) retired and made it a tradition to swap jerseys with a player from the other team after some games for his final season. On Saturday, LeBron James swapped jerseys with Ja Morant, a young star in his first season. It happens occasionally after big games or somewhat historic moments. But it's not like an everyday thing."
"N.B.A.’s Undercover Secret: Players’ Protective Pads  Tight-fitting undergarments with protective padding are becoming increasingly popular among N.B.A. players like Dwyane Wade. Tight-fitting undergarments with protective padding are becoming increasingly popular among N.B.A. players like Dwyane Wade. By Jonathan Abrams April 25, 2009  These days, basketball players are prepared to take a fall.  Many N.B.A. and college players wear thigh pads and chest pads beneath their loose-fitting uniforms, and their numbers have steadily risen. The quaint sport that Dr. James Naismith introduced to pass time in the winter has evolved into a full-contact sport requiring full-time protection.  “In the paint, basketball is very physical,” the Orlando Magic’s Dwight Howard said. “You’ve got elbows flying, bodies flying, crashing, people fighting for position. I don’t think people see all of that. That’s why a lot of people have been wearing those.”  He pointed to his teammate Mickael Pietrus, who was sliding into a flak jacket before a recent game.  The padding pioneer was Shaquille O’Neal, whose 7-foot-1, 315-pound frame provides ample room for bumps and bruises. O’Neal had worn girdlelike protection for a while, but five seasons ago when he joined the Miami Heat, he consulted with Ron Culp, then the team’s longtime trainer, on how to best nurse a bruised rib while continuing to play.  “When I came in, people thought the best way to stop me was to be physical,” said O’Neal, an 18-year veteran. “It didn’t really hurt. The little knickknack bruises started to add up.”  Culp considered having O’Neal wear a bulletproof vest, but it restricted movement and weighed too much. Culp then approached Kevin O’Neill, the Miami Dolphins’ head trainer.  Unlock more free articles. Create an account or log in O’Neal may stand taller, but he weighs about the same as many football players. And after witnessing the contact O’Neal absorbed, Culp said, it was only natural to consult a football team about protection.  “Basketball is the most physical noncontact sport in the world,” Culp said. “There’s a conundrum. You’re putting 10 oversized people in an undersized place and telling them to run as fast as they can and jump as high as they can and to not get hurt while doing it.”  Soon, the Heat’s Dwyane Wade started wearing the padding because he “bounces off of people like he is on a pool table,” Culp said.  Editors’ Picks  What’s a Quibi? A Way to Amuse Yourself Until You’re Dead  A German Mine Hit and the Ship Split in Half  The Truth About Alligators in the Sewers of New York O’Neal, now with Phoenix, said, “I’m a trendsetter, baby.”  LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Amar’e Stoudemire are also among those who don padding during games.  The game’s most dynamic players, those who draw the most attention and absorb the most contact, are regular users.  The extra cushioning provided by padded compression shorts and a tight-fitting padded V-neck undershirt goes mostly unnoticed.  But players are convinced that these special undergarments can prevent injury.  “It works,” Philadelphia 76ers forward Thaddeus Young said as he held a protective shirt. “It depends where you get hit at. You want to protect some of the things in your body, and I’ve gotten elbowed a couple times in my ribs and they tend to be hurting for a while.  “This gives me a little more peace of mind.”  Because of O’Neal and others, McDavid, a manufacturer of protective sports equipment based in Illinois, modified its N.F.L. gear for basketball use. Its HexPad technology involves forming foam composites into hundreds of lightweight hexagonal pads that are bonded into fabric. Unlike most football pads, they do not have to be removed for washing.  The N.B.A. is happy as long as no one sees the extra padding.  “Whether they’re wearing padded or nonpadded compression gear, they can’t be visible while they’re at a standstill, and the compression tanks can’t be visible under the jersey as well,” said Stu Jackson, the league’s executive vice president for basketball operations.  “The compression items that are issued by the team are from our apparel partner, which is Adidas. They’re cut in a way that are not visible, so if a player chooses to wear another compression item, it must be so it’s not visible.”  But that makes it tougher to market to younger players.  “That’s the hard part of the product, that nobody sees it,” said Rey Corpuz, McDavid’s marketing director, who estimated that basketball padding for all ages could become a $15 million to $20 million business for his company. “It’s designed specifically not to be seen at the N.B.A. level.”  Other companies, including Nike and Under Armour, have also developed protective padding for basketball players.  “We really see this as the new modern-day uniform system,” said Todd Van Horne, a Nike creative director. “You’re not just using the jersey that’s wearing the number on the outside. The players are bigger, they’re stronger. They’re more competitive.”  So are the companies that have entered this burgeoning apparel category. McDavid sued Nike and later Adidas, citing patent infringement, and is seeking to have them cease manufacturing padded undergarments. Neither lawsuit has not been resolved.  Derek Kent, a Nike spokesman, said that the lawsuit lacked factual merit and that Nike filed for its own patent nearly two years ago.  “As an innovation-orientated company for athletes during the last 36 years,” Kent said, “Nike believes that athletes can decide which products provide the greatest performance advantage and that both should be allowed to compete in the marketplace unchanged.”  The popularity of the padded garments for basketball has been a coup for McDavid.  “If you go back into the ’70s, guys are wearing knee pads,” Corpuz said. “Padding isn’t outside of the culture. Our biggest challenge was changing the mind-set of the average basketball player that padding was already there.”  Still, some players bristle at wearing body pads, fearing that they may restrict movement or questioning the need for them in the first place.  “Those guys who use them bang a lot,” the veteran Nets guard Keyon Dooling said. “They get the ball a lot more than me. Over the years, I’ve learned how to avoid being hit by the big guys.”"
I’m going to give Lebron the benefit of the doubt. He’s getting older but he’s Lebron James and he’s proven that he’s always coasting during the regular season previously.
Do you not know who Kawhi Leonard and Lebron James are? Two of the elite few in NBA history who can turn it up a notch in playoffs   I mean Bucks might be the favorites but I can definitely see how’d they get beat
Bucks fans freaking out over the fact that a few people think LeBron James should get a few MVP votes is so weird
"My idea of MVP is: If the fate of the universe depended on one play, who would you give the ball to?  To me that is Lebron James. Giannis is having a monster year tho and NBA doesn’t judge MVPs with my standard."
"Well, LeBron calls Alex Caruso ""the GOAT"" whenever they see each other(so basically every day, multiple times per day.) And a lot of Lakers fans seem to actually believe it. Especially after the all star voting came out and he came in as the #6 guard in the fan vote. That's what happens when you give everyone in LA 10 votes. Same with Boston fans getting Tacko Fall onto the list(but like AC, not onto the team) after playing 13 minutes of(fairly ineffective) NBA basketball just because he's a 7'6"" freak. They've had days where Theis and Kanter have both been out and this dude still never saw the court. I think LeBron likes JaVale too(along with everyone else who wasn't traded to NO for AD,) and daily ego boosts from LeBron James have gotta be a hell of a drug..."
I wouldn’t even be mad if Giannis won it over lebron.  I would be if say james harden did.
"The Shaq Finals streak is still really cool: every NBA Final since 1983 has featured a past, present, or future teammate of Shaquille O'Neal.  The streak is heavily favored to continue this year due to Shaq being a former teammate of LeBron James, Danny Green, and Robin Lopez."
"Giannis should and will win it, but to act like there shouldn't be some sort of discussion seems a little short-sighted. Giannis' team functions pretty well with him on and off of the court, whereas the Lakers rely heavily on LeBron James, who's leading the NBA in assists while being one of the top scorers in the league on a team that will more likely than not be the 1 seed and win 60 games.   Lebron is agruably more valuable to the Lakers than Giannis is to the Bucks. Again arguably, so some discussion seems warranted."
Luke Kennard holds the Ohio basketball record for most points in high school over the inferior Lebron James   Shouldn’t come as a surprise tho
D Rose got the 1 seed over prime Lebron James/ D Wade and a perennial All Star. how is that a robbery?
"LeBron ""Mocking a Sick Dirk"" James, petty? Why I never!"
LeBron is the exception. Not the rule. It's fuckin LeBron James. Possibly the greatest player to ever do it.
- 2017 Russell Westbrook - 2014 Kevin Durant - 2012 LeBron James - 2008 Kobe Bryant - 2006 Steve Nash - 2002 Tim Duncan  That's 6 of the last 18 MVP awards. MVP goes to someone other than the best player on the best regular season team regularly enough.
LeBron James is good
"Lebron is a villian in that MANY people still see him as a villian, though I agree that the reasoning is not logical.  [https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/Kevin-Durant-second-most-hated-player-LeBron-James-14057084.php](https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/Kevin-Durant-second-most-hated-player-LeBron-James-14057084.php)"
"I disagree, he was def doubted. People never thought he would amount to what he is now or even close. There were people saying similar things like how he was playing inferior “kids”” in high school. Even when LeBron got drafted, he had teammates publicly hate on him too.   [bunch of public forums shitted on LeBron](https://basketballforever.com/2017/05/08/internet-geniuses-thought-lebron-james-drafted)   [teammates even discredited him publicly after he was drafted](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2017/06/lebron-cavaliers-2003-nba-draft-doubt-haters-cut-grass-instagram/amp)   I just don’t think y’all saw all the hate like we see it now due to social media and increased sports coverage."
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. LeBron James 3. Kawahi Leonard 4. James Harden  5. Anthony Davis 6. Nikola Jokic  7. Russell Westbrook

To reference another thread where we were talking about how James’ team has finished 1/2 for 8 straight years and simply went on to be absolutely terrible the year he left - my definition of MVP is simply how big of a difference is there between the team with said player and with out. I don’t think anyone holds a candle to James in this regard. I think the only way to argue Giannis for MVP is if you have a different definition of MVP - and I’m not saying mine is right but based on my personal belief of what an MVP is it’s Lebron hands down.
I don’t think he can every try again him He is lebron james of his team
You’re saying he’s better than LeBron James?
You guys are nuts. The best basketball player in the world should always win the MVP award. By definition he is the best so therefore the most valuable. End of discussion. That’s LeBron James and has been for a looooooong-ass time.
Zion Williamson: 35 Points Lebron James: 34 Points
Fuck them kids        -Lebron James
Literally all you have to do is think about each season for 10 seconds and it’s that clear. But it’s easier to just repeat “Lebron James best player”
"LeBron James, he of multiple championships, MVPs and countless other awards, and by most measures the #2 all time basketball player, has a victim complex? Lmao wut"
"&gt;Pelicans have proven vets.  Proven vets who've done what? Teh Lakers have Lebron James, and that's all that matters unless your team has Kawhi or Durant."
LeBron “George Blanda” James
No it’s not lol. It’s LeBron freakin James lmao
" &gt;LeBron ""Trae ""Damian ""Steph Curry"" Lillard"" Young"" James  FTFY"
I had to do a double take to make sure I didn't read this sentence backwards.  LEBRON JAMES ties LUKA DONCIC  That's crazy. God Luka's awesome
This LeBron James gets is pretty good at the basketballs.
“the inferior lebron james” i like the sound of that.
"Luke Kennard and Lebron James, two Ohio legends always getting snubbed"
No I do not I also don’t remember James Harden‘s or most Lebron Games against us weird I do remember Hezonja dunking on Giannis  and remember one game LeBron played against us where he got blocked by Hezonja tho
LeBron isn't banging in the post like Zion is. Do you really think the refs treat him unfairly? He's LeBron James lol. I mean I'm sure there's bad calls but there's not a conspiracy against him lol.
What did Jason Barkley do to Lebron James
“Numba 1 LeBron James”
I hate Lebron James. The “king”. Chosen on his back. Never seen arrogance like it. Speaks out on every social issue that fits his brand but cops out with the China issue because it’ll lighten his wallet. Fucking guy just needs to shut up and choose a lane. Nothing worse than a celebrity that picks and chooses issues that suit them to speak out on.   And don’t get me started on Tony Charmin Davis.
"Actually they do, it's called LeBron James and he barely gets to the line."
LeBron James
LeBron James
"Lebron James. We did this for you, grizzlies fans."

"Lebron James, future Presidential candidate"
Yeah nothing like those home grown LA players Lebron James and Anthony Davis lol.
“James for a step back 3!”  Lebron like a full 2 feet inside the 3 point line. Am I watching the same game as these announcers lol.
"LeBron ""Jr Smith"" James"
lEbRoN jAmEs jUsT vIoLaTeD
Rondos peak was being the best player on the floor of a playoff game with players like Kevin Garnett Paul pierce LeBron James D Wade and Chris bosh Not that crazy of a comparison if you limited to his short prime
LeBron James.
Lebron James is now taking his 2nd and 3rd free throws of the game
Imagine having Lebron James on your team
LeBron James
1 free throw for Lebron James but Zion has 11. Help me understand
The only downside of having Lebron James on your team is that they become over reliant on him and become booty when he’s off the floor. These Lakers squad is the same even with AD playing.   The only problem is Lebron is historically healthy.
"LeBron James is a cyborg from the year 2050 and no one can convince me otherwise, that’s the only explanation on how he can do these things"
LeBron “Gamebred” James
Is Alvin Gentry an NBA coach? Does he know who Lebron James is?   1v1 on Lebron is a free bucket.
How are you gonna try to bully ball Lebron fucking James  He's literally built his career on his legendary strength lmao what
"Are you kidding me? Zion Williamson gets so many more calls than LeBron James, it's ridiculous lol"
Melli gets more calls then lebron James
"Progression is not linear. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, and Zion Williamson's prime years may not even reach LeBron James's prime years. Give me the player who's already an all time great in LeBron James lol"
LeBron James is the best player on the planet
"LeBron ""Damian ""Steph Curry"" Lillard"" James"
"Oh, LeBron James was stone cold horseshit against Memphis and then decides to sweat us as usual this game? Never saw it coming folks."
BREAKING: Lebron James seems to have come down with a cough after Lance Stephenson is brought down from China...
"James isn’t wrong. Giannis is a freak of nature. Like LeBron and Calvin Johnson. No doubting Giannis hard work but when you are so much stronger, faster and taller than your competition it’s genetics not skill. Well plus the obvious hard work."
Zion is straight up cucking lebron james
"I agree that you 100 *can* improve your basketball IQ but I also think there's a significant variability in basketball IQ capacity.   For instance, Andre Drummond has developed many, many good basketball tidbits since entering the league. If you were to ask him about what he understands about the game now versus what he knew as a rookie, he'd likely scoff at the younger version of himself.  That said, no matter what Andre Drummond ever does, his capacity for understanding and seeing the game seems to have a much lower ceiling than that of a LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Jason Kidd, or Larry Bird (not that there's anything wrong with that - those guys are the best ever, but the point stands).   I've seen it in the amateur level too. As both a player and a coach I've come across a handful of guys over the last two decades who just... process and understand things at a completely different level than everyone else on the basketball court. And the maddening thing is that it often seems natural. Like, I could study the game harder, practice hundreds or thousands of more hours and it felt like I still wouldn't be able to see the game like the special ones."
I thought Ja was just being polite to this kid Lebron James.  The balls on the LeBron though
"I didn’t even need to read past the first paragraph to know you’re full of shit. You never watched KG if you unironically take any of those dudes over him.   Also, I’d take dirk over KD personally. Dirk carried his team thru a stacked western conference and went on to beat a stacked Heat team lead by Lebron mf James almost solely on contested jump shots. Shit was wild. Drafting dirk means you’re automatically gifted one championship at some point of his career because his peak is literally Mount Everest and he’s cold as the summit. KD had to leave his MVP teammates for better MVP teammates  Nash is way better than Dame, Kyrie and Westbrook wtf are you smoking???"

"If he keeps it up in the playoffs, yeah sure  Until then Imma go with the man who's proven he is for the past decade; LeBron James"
LeBron will name his future kid Ja James jr
LeBron still has the body of a 19 year old and she's 21 forever  Ty for downvoting https://newsone.com/3573138/doctors-say-lebron-james-has-body-of-a-19-year-old/
"You should follow the most popular player on the most popular team for a while, because they will be covered in the news and by the media 100 times more than the rest of the teams. By following the main character, it will be easier to learn the rest of the league. So, go with LeBron James on the Lakers. Plus, he is the player most connected to Kobe right now for a lot of reasons. Both came in to the NBA right out of high school, both played for the Lakers, Lebron just passed him in all-time scoring, Kobe's last tweet before he died was to Lebron telling him to keep carrying the NBA moving forward.  Then, after you have gotten a good feel for the NBA, it will be easier to pick a favorite team."
He must be related to Lebron “I’ve never been on a super team” James
The wrong vet LMFAO trae will Meg LeBron FUCKING James. He ain't scared of some washed up keep getting Dem checks ass players hell do it again too and take those free points
"How is improper roster construction a by product of building around Lebron? Not having competent back up ball handlers doesn’t really have anything to do with Lebrons tendency to dominate the basketball. Lots of teams with ball dominant superstars had good ball handlers that could run an offense effectively. James Harden for example had CP3 and Lou Williams, and the rockets built their offensive system around his ability to score.   The lakers problem for example would be fixed if they had someone like Collison or D Rose to take over ball handling responsibilities when Lebron goes to the bench. Their one competent ball handler/decision maker away from eliminating the issue entirely, so I’m not really understanding the logic here.   The truth is that Lebron has never had solid PGs on his team that ran the offense and made smart decisions consistently and when he did the offense was too stagnant for them to highly effective as the primary option in non Lebron lineups. Kyrie wasn’t the kind of player who could assist the ball effectively in Cleveland, he was an elite scorer but he had tunnel vision, Celtics get so much more movement so this wasn’t as big of an issue there. He did have Hill and Clarkson in 2018 but those guys just did not play well at all which in my opinion was an issue with the stagnant iso ball in Cleveland. If Lebron had someone like CP3 or Fred Vanfleet or Kyle Lowry backing him up, I’m fairly sure Lebron teams wouldn’t plummet without him on the floor"
Because Lebron James is a media fucking powerhouse.
This sub throwing a tantrum over *LeBron James* being pushed for MVP is hilarious

What did LeBron James say to the face?
"Wow crazy, kinda of like most people when they get paired with Lebron James? It's easy being second fiddle. He couldn't get there as the main guy."
"Nah this is horse shit, Ingram, Lonzo and Kuzma were literally the worst NBA players of all time last season, mainly because they were on the Lakers and attached to LeBron James"
"LeBron ""Norman Powell"" James"
"I still care and although I'm just one person and my opinion won't change anything, I lost a lot of respect for LeBron James."
Kyrie averaged 1 less point than Lebron for the entire playoffs. Cavs would’ve easily made the playoffs without Chairman James and possibly still reached the Finals
This just in: it helps if the other star is LeBron James.
"“I play for the fans, that’s what it’s all about,” James said. “If I show up to the arena and there ain’t no fans there, I ain’t playing.”  .. Ok LeBron but you also make millions and millions of dollars to play a game lol that sounded so entitled"

"who the fuck says morey did anything. im talking about what lebron didnt do, which is shy away from hurting his bank account when he could have said something more along the lines of shaq, stotts, etc. and yeah dude Lebron James condemning china publicly wouldn't do literally ANYTHING, youre so right"
"The King, and oh yeah that other guy lebron James."
dude it’s lebron fucking james he can do what he wants he is the face of the league haha
"Again, how does talking about the Lakers justify your point? Just because y’all see Lakers fans making posts means that you guys must make them to? Seems hypocritical dude.  Also, are you really comparing the Raptors to the Lakers? Seriously? I’m not even being biased bro, it’s just that it’s delusional to even think that they are on the same tier when it comes to appeal.  Take a step back into reality, and put yourself in the shoes of a casual NBA fan, or a casual citizen in general:  There’s a team in the NBA called the Los Angeles Lakers. They are one of the biggest market teams in the world, and share the likes of the most popular team in the United States with the Yankees, Cowboys, etc. They are 16x NBA Champions, with legends that have played for them such as Shaq, Kobe, and now the greatest basketball player in our generation, LeBron fucking James, the man that has garnered attention since he was in high school.  Now why do they get the most attention in this sub? Because they are the most appealing team in the NBA. They make the most money, get the best ratings, get the most attention from media outlets, and they are the best team in the West right now.   So of course this sub is filled with Lakers posts, **because that’s what the people want to see.**  Now let’s talk about the Raptors... a team that isn’t even in ‘Murica, they’re best players aren’t even that marketable in ‘Murica,  and their best player in franchise history that could’ve appealed to ‘Murica left them to go to Los Angeles Clippers. Let’s also not forget that the only time they get attention big social media outlets is when Drake does something while @ courtside.  Now, why do people bitch about the Raps and not the Lakers... maybe it’s because they don’t love you guys like that. People want to see the Lakers, and they are satisifed when the see posts about them.  Then there’s the Raptors fanbase, that constantly annoy this sub because they want they same love that the Lakers get... except they don’t have it. Of course people are going to bitch about y’all, nobody wants a team that they don’t care about shoved in their face.  Also thanks for calling me whiny when I was calling out a guy that was calling another person a virgin. You’re such an angel for defending a guy that was bullying another over the internet."
"&gt; Find a single NBA player who thinks their job is to sell tickets rather than win basketball games.   “I play for the fans, that’s what it’s all about,” James said. “If I show up to the arena and there ain’t no fans there, I ain’t playing.”  https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/03/09/lebron-james-no-fans-nba-coronavirus/"

"Only if Giannis misses a lot of time. The ""absolute tear"" LeBron is on over the past couple of weeks comes *close* to Giannis' full-season averages (30/14/6 over 30mpg).  [Here's the full-season comparison for the curious.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;player_id1_select=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;player_id1=antetgi01&amp;y1=2020&amp;player_id2_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id2_select=LeBron+James&amp;player_id2=jamesle01&amp;idx=players&amp;y2=2020)"
"so the ""our economy is based lebron james"" wasn't really a joke?"
"It's the Mike Trout effect. Every year some player has a career year that gets them stats close to Trout's, and then people talk all season about ""Is Betts/Altuve/Yelich/Acuna better than trout??"" And then that player comes back to earth, some other dude has a great season, and the comparison shifts.  Once you realize that Bron and Trout are the constants in that conversation, it becomes obvious that they're the best. The analysts have to argue about something though, otherwise all the shoes would just be ""who's the best player in the league?"" ""LeBron"" which is boring. Just like MVP voter fatigue; if it actually went to the most valuable player every season, it would just be ""the LeBron James award""."
LeBron James is back on his throne.
"I agree that's what you do if you're in a FO. You do what you can to make Kyrie and KD happy and not try to screw it up.  But it's a terrible sign for a player when they do all they can to get their coach fired. It's not a good sign for the future, unless your name is LeBron James and you happen to be a top 2 player of all time"
"&gt;“I’m speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I’ve said a lot of things.""  -Donald Trump  - LeBron James"
"Lebron James keeps locker rooms together? The same Lebron who did everything he could to show he wasn't happy with Blatt? The same Lebron who constantly threw his teammates under the bus in the media and bullied IT in Cleveland? The same Lebron who lost the trust of his young teammates in LA in less than a season?  He's a great player and a good leader to those he likes, but let's not act that he won't throw gas on a fire if he's unhappy."
Lebron James DESTROYS Clippers with FACTS and LOGIC
I always said LeBron was James Johnson from the neck down.
"21 - Vince Carter    18 - Tyson Chandler    16 - LeBron James   16 - Carmelo Anthony   16 - Kyle Korver   16 - Udonis Haslem    15 - Dwight Howard   15 - Trevor Ariza   15 - Andre Iguodala    14 - Chris Paul   14 - Lou Williams   14 - Marvin Williams    13 - Kyle Lowry   13 - LaMarcus Aldridge   13 - Paul Millsap   13 - J.J. Redick   13 - Rajon Rondo   13 - Rudy Gay   13 - J.J. Barea   13 - Thabo Sefolosha    Some of these guys are definitely fully washed, but most of them are still serviceable NBA players, I guess that's why they're still playing. It also puts into perspective how crazy LeBron's current form is compared to others around his age, it's superhuman."
"Man there's confidence and trash talking and there's just straight up delusion. Pat Bev these days is definitely falling into the latter half. Like brah are you really trying to act like you're all that against fucking *Lebron James* and *Steph Curry*? Two of the greatest players of the decade, one who's in regular GOAT conversation and the other the greatest shooter and arguably 2nd best PG of all time? SMH come on."
Fuck Lebron James lol
"according to beverley, not lebron ""no challenge"" james"
"Do you think AD will eventually get frustrated just like other past Lebron James superstar teammates?   When they lose it’ll be all because Lebron didn’t have enough help. When they win it’ll be because of Lebrons greatness.   AD had 30 and 8 against the Clippers, but all the media is talking about is Lebron."

LeBron James
"If Russell Westbrook and CP3 formed into one, you would have a smaller Lebron James."
"2004-05: Steve Nash  2005-06: Steve Nash 2006-07: Dirk Nowitzki  2007-08: Kobe Bryant 2008-09: LeBron James 2009-10: LeBron James 2010-11: Derrick Rose  2011-12: LeBron James  2012-13: LeBron James  2013-14: Kevin Durant  2014-15: Stephen Curry  2015-16: Stephen Curry  2016-17: Russell Westbrook  2017-18: James Harden   Besides lbj and maybe kobe, who of these were elite defenders?"
* Udonis Haslem * Kyle Korver * Carmelo Anthony * LeBron James
"Easier said than done. If you always try to avoid the switch the roller will be open and James is the best passer right now. So pick your poison.  Lebron is doing this all his career. IT, derozan, steph are some of the recievers of this pick and roll switch.  This isnt just switching to the weaker defender though. Another important reason is to switch on the scorer of the other team to force him to play both defence and offence to wear him out."
"&gt;Luka Doncic is still the MVP frontrunner over Giannis and Lebron James, and it isn't particularly close."
"To me, you can't really definitively choose the ""best"" player of all time though I believe it has to be one of 5 players with MJ at top. It's all down to personal opinion; I like to separate them into tiers and that's not even a definite ranking; so much goes into a players skillset and it isn't a one on one game. If I was building a team, I would actually be happy with practically all players in the top tiers all time. Those great players at the top are so close together in terms of their overall skillset/game. With the right team built around them, coaching, luck, etc. they might've well ended up being the greatest or close to it.  Though the GOAT debate is not even a question; it's Jordan. Not only is he arguably the best player (tier 1), he's by far the greatest. His impact on the game, his stats, eye test, demeanor, marketability, winning, etc. The only way I see LeBron being considered 1A 1B with him is if LeBron somehow 2-3peats in LA with 2 Finals MVPs (He will also break the record for points most likely). I actually can also see 1 more ring with all these broken records make him 1B for plenty of people.  I did a quick best players tier list below for fun. It is highly debatable but I think there are 3 definite players in Tier 1 (MJ, Bron and Kareem). My tier 1 basically came down to who I think are the most dominant players of all time. Then it goes on (Barkley, KG, Curry, Moses, KG, Dirk, Baylor, etc.). I just tried to do 5 per tier but you can definitely do more and some of them would fit into those. All these players are so good that in an all time draft; I wouldn't mind having any of them to try to build a team and win.  Tier 1:  * Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem Abdul Jabbar * Shaquille O'Neal * Wilt Chamberlain  Tier 2:  * Kobe Bryant * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Bill Russell * Hakeem Olajuwon  Tier 3:  * Tim Duncan * Jerry West * Oscar Robertson * Kevin Durant * Julius Irving"
"This is so BIASED. Using per36 we dont even know if Giannis can hold up 36 minites. He gets gassed bad and commits bad fouls late that foul him out. He shoots good 1 out of 10 games. And only really dunks, hes a beats tho no disrespect. I love Giannis, we African. But come on. His rebounds lead to him getting more points. James is leading in points created. His assists are way more needed by the lakers. And his points created is 56 or so.  Can any of you tell me Giannis is needed more than Lebron. And theyre both 1 seed but ones in the west remember."
He's a parasite who owes his career to LeBron James.
Lebron James is money centric first after that whole China comment. He’s an ass.
"Lebron James has a fake, try hard personality that makes him really unlikable."
At first I thought this was a parody... 😯   [Patrick Beverley says guarding LeBron James is 'no challenge' after getting cooked by Lakers](https://sports.yahoo.com/patrick-beverley-lebron-james-no-challenge-lakers-clippers-nba-002907162.html)
That fans name? Lebron James.
* Michael Jordan  * Kobe Bryant  * LeBron James  * Patrick Beverley  Sure why not
"Nobody denies he is the engine, but the same way that Steph was more valuable in the eyes of some and KD was the better player it also applies here.  I was talking specifically for today aswell, AD was the best player on the floor ALL night and LeBron similarly to the previous two games against the Clippers, struggled all night finishing at the rim and with his jump shot due to the Clippers defense.  Also, the point about the free throws is how many of his points actually came from the free throw line, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how you get there what matters is that if you score 28, but did it going 12-14 from the line it means that you relied heavily on foul drawing to score, which is something that if it was James Harden he would be absolutely buried by this sub."
"I get that you’re trying to praise his bball IQ, but Lebron James is the most impressive physical specimen this planet has ever produced alongside Wilt Chamberlain."
"I think he meant ""no challange at all for Lebron James""  I used to like Bevs hustle and hard work, but increasingly I find he is a dirty player who gets away with so many fouls. After I saw him injure Russell Westbrook, I lost respect"
"&gt; Is there any question that LBJ is the best player in the league when he knows it's his time to shine?  What does Anthony Davis have to do to get credit, jesus christ the LeBron fandom is nauseating.  AD was clearly from the tip the best player on the Lakers and before a layup with 40s left and the game decided LeBron was 6-16 from the field with most of his point coming from the free throw line (if that was James Harden people would kill him for it).  He had an okay game, Avery Bradley, AD and Marcus Morris were more of a reason for the Lakers win than LeBron."
"Kyrie also had the best cast with him. I mean, he had fucking LeBron James with him containing his crazy ass. Kemba had Michael Kidd Gilchcrist. Kyrie also has ruined two teams, maybe one more depending on what you think about Cleveland. We all know how much has Kyrie accomplished without the best player since MJ playing alongside him"
He's also LeBron fucking James.
"Kawhi had 0 assists tonight, he’s not on Lebron James’ level and you know it you clown ass. Kawhi would’ve taken the cavs to the finals in 2018? That was less than two years ago Bitch put some respect on the King’s name for me before you look really fuckin dumb come May."
"I watch every Laker game man, I'm not saying AD is better than LeBron but Davis is having a great season and people hardly talk about him stealing votes from LeBron. If his partner in crimes name wasn't LeBron James he'd be in the race too"
"Y’all really have a hate boner for Laker fans so much that you’d blindly say some racist fuck who did that is a fan. Likely it was just a dude that didn’t like him speaking about politics. Statistically, most people who aren’t basketball fans know who tf LeBron James is."
"I never understand why this isn't brought up more, AD leads the team in pts, rebounds, blocks, steals, PER, OWS, DWS, and BPM, and probably DPOY (Imo that should be Giannis too but the media wants AD to have it) yet he's not even included in the conversation just because his teammates' name is LeBron James and the narrative of ""It's his 17th season still playing elite playing point guard"". If you exclude names AD should be in the conversation not LeBron"
"What? I didn't take it personally, I'm just saying from a marketing stand point that was a direct shot at Lebron. His nickname is literally King James and he plays for what's considered the greatest LA team. Them calling Kawhi king of LA was most definitely a shot, it has nothing to do with feelings. That's why I called you naive."
"you do know MJ won a DPOY, right? and lebron james hasn't"
"Pat bev trick yall man, he just running around sounding dumb af doing nothing to lebron james"
"When LeBron went to Riley, Wade and Bosh accompanied him. That was when they all asked Riley to coach them. He told them no, saying he didnt have the itch.  https://heatnation.com/media/pat-riley-reveals-lebron-james-wanted-erik-spoelstra-fired-2010/"
"He usually goes one of two ways. Either he doubles, triples down with his normal takes, or he tries to steal Shannon's moment by putting over Lebron to an obnoxious level. That's what I predict he will do. He'll say something like ""LeBron James has officially won the MVP and NBA Championship this weekend! Congratulations Shannon."" Shannon will say something like, ""Skieeeup Let me have my moment!"" That'll be the gist of the conversation."
"Lol as a Bron stand I actually think Kawhi is obviously a better shooter and arguably a more consistent defender.   But, no Kawhi DID NOT prove he's the better player tonight, vs. a 35-year LeBron James"
Finally something common I can say about LeBron James and my penis.
"Should have put the /s next to it, nobody should leave Lebron James open"
the media is so fucking dumb.  they all talk about the Clippers like they're some kinda dynasty.  the only dynasty in the NBA right now is LeBron James.

"LeBron crowned himself ""King James"" before he had accomplished a goddamn thing. Giannis is about to win back-to-back MVPs, he's not some scrub with no resume.  Some trash talk and arrogance is entertaining and part of the game. Stop being a fucking bitch."
That is post ASB Lebron James. Playoff Lebron James hasn't arrive yet.
LeBron James is good at basketball
"&gt;Lebron James is still best playerin the league   No he isn’t, that title definitely goes to Rondo, DPOY"
"He is a LeBron James type of 3pt player/shooter. As in, they are like 35% to 37% (which is good) but they shoot a lot of bad 3's, don't fucking tell me that Morris is the new Curry or Klay, stop it."

I wonder your motivation could possibly be for trying to downplay what LeBron James is doing... No idea
"First let's hear if Doc. LeBron Raymone James Sr. agrees with this, then maybe all NBA games will be played with no fans"
"""LeBron James states that he wants to leave the Lakers this summer and play for the Knicks!""  ""By the way, this might not be true."""
"Based on this sub, Zion Williamson is the next LeBron James and Ja Morant is the next KD. Future HOFers for sure"
You're right no one listens to LeBron James he's just a basketball player why should we listen to his opinion on this. /s  Lakers stans really are next level at protecting their king
"That's sort of what I had in mind.  After all, Lebron did tell an opponent what he was supposed to do: [https://www.slamonline.com/nba/lebron-james-told-raptors-run-plays-game/](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/lebron-james-told-raptors-run-plays-game/)  That's how much he owned the Raptors. He was coaching them during the game, as he was beating them.  From that POV, Lebron is more Duncan than Jordan."

"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father. I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know. I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people. and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s. I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better. he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?"" and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league? I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now..... until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible.. edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."
"Just to keep this simple I’m gonna copy the top 25 list of playoffs players that Bill Simmons and Zach Lowe went over. First 24 are on order and 25-33 they had is the same category competing for the 25th spot, neither picked gobert for it.  (And I just added non playoff players and injured guys to the end for a player count) Or if we add in non playoff players then steph, KAT, booker, trey young and dreymond greenare in that list and if you want to take away injuries then you can add klay, KD, Irving and Blake griffin all somewhere in that list as well. Putting gobert in the top 35 is arguable, but it’s also arguable he’s outside the top 35-40, and there no chance he’s in the top 30 anyway you argue it.    1- Kawhai Leonard  2- LeBron James  3- Giannis Antetokounmpo  4- Anthony Davis  5- James Harden  6- Joel Embiid  7- Paul George  8- Damian Lillard  9- Jayson Tatum  10- Luka Doncic  11- Nikola Jokic  12- Kyle Lowry  13- Pascal Siakem  14- Bam Adebayo  15- Russell Westbrook  16- Khris Middleton  17- Jimmy Butler  18- Jaylen Brown  19- Donovan Mitchell  20- Chris Paul  21- Bradley Beal  22- Ben Simmons  23- Kemba Walker  24- Zion Williamson  25- Ja  26- Sabonis   27- Murray  28- Ingram  29- SGA  30- Brogdon  31- Oladpipo   32- Gobert  33- McCollum  34- steph   35-klay   36-dreymond   37-young  38-KD   39-Irving    40-Blake  41-booker"

"Very wrong, that's on him for having no clue where the ball is, or where LeBron fucking James is for that matter."
Lebron James is definitively not the greatest playmaker/facilitator in history. He was not a better playmaker or facilitator than either Bird or Magic.
"&gt; Giannis having the better basic stat season, Lebron having the better advanced one.  [Giannis is ahead of LeBron in basically every advanced stat except  OWS and AST%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;player_id1_select=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;y1=2020&amp;player_id1=antetgi01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id2_select=LeBron+James&amp;y2=2020&amp;player_id2=jamesle01&amp;idx=players)"
"&gt; Draymond has proved he can’t lead a team this year  1. He's been hurt. 2. Of the entire lineup last season, 3 players remain on this year's roster. None are currently healthy. Lebron James coulnd't lead this team to 30 wins.  3. You are an idiot. 4. So am I for continuing to respond to this stupid shit."
"There are no options. Your best bet is LeBron doesn't score enough in isolation on the switch. You can ICE/Blue the PNR but LeBron James too good at finishing in the paint. If AD is the screener you absolutely must give AD the open pick and pop and hope he misses.  Switching is ideal. Get your best defender to guard the screener so he ends up on Bron ala what the Cavs did to GSW in 2016 game 5-7. They put Bron on Dray so they can neutralize warriors top offensive play -- the 1/5 PnR with Curry/Dray. GSW's entire gameplan was predicated on Curry's gravity creating the defensive attention needed in SnR action to find Dray as the creator to create open shots, layups dunks for the open guy at the back end of the play. Cavs neutralized that with LeBron switching because now no more hedging, doubling and it's curry and Bron 1 on 1 after the switch. Bron blocks his ass a few time, stops him and now he's in your head. GSW offense now needs to do something else or screen with someone that can't create like dray. Same shit happened to rose and the bulls. Bron as the screen defender switches on you.   Clips could do that with kawhi but LeBron is much harder to stop 1 on 1 than Curry. And Bron can always ask someone else to screen. Bron also doesn't need the 2nd creator as he's the best skip passer, long range passer, passer out if double teams the league has ever seen.   Only options are   1) live with Bron scoring and stay home   or   2) let his teammates shoot. Pick like the one guy you want to leave open and leave him open. Get the ball out of bron's hand.. don't let him dissect your defense.  Only team I've seen do well we're this era bulls in the non 2011 years. Hos scoring was lower but playmaking better still..by the 2nd Cavs era, I didn't see shit. Bron still manufactured a 120 ORtg offense against GSW.."
"Lebron James, Lebron Jim, Lebron Jimothy"
And with no LeBron [apparently](https://www.chron.com/sports/rockets/article/LeBron-James-NBA-coronavirus-not-playing-no-fans-15113397.php).
"&gt; ""It's always been reported Lebron didn't want to play point guard. This morning for example: https://streamable.com/8t82w  &gt; Lebron never wanted to play point guard if he wanted to he already would have earlier in his career. In his rookie season he was put at point guard and he struggled with it and since then has not wanted to do it.""  No it has not always been reported. Sharing a clip of someone stating an opinion is not a fact. When is this always that you are referring to? Please share some factual examples that support your statement. This is from Lebron's first year with the Cavs.   &gt; *""Whispers about the lack of attention that various Cavs players are paying to Blatt during some timeout huddles, as well as their apparent preference to communicate with Cavs assistant and former NBA player Tyronn Lue, have been in circulation for weeks. And James acknowledged recently that he did not formally request permission to assume the bulk of the Cavs’ playmaking duties, which triggered Cleveland’s eight-game winning streak earlier this month.""*  &gt; *“No, I can do it on my own,” James said of his role change. “I’m past those days where I have to ask.”*  That quote alone invalidates your point. Are you really trying to pass something from his rookie season 17 years ago as something applicable and relevant today? Stop reaching.   &gt; ""I already agreed no player is replacing Lebron and explained the point of having Harris and Melo. Why did you just repeat that?  &gt; Because no player can actually substitute for Lebron certainly no role player small forward.""  Are you dense? What part of my explanation are you not understanding? Once again, I am not stating that any player can replace Lebron. Theres a difference in expecting a player to replace Lebron and expecting them to play a position. Not having a backup small forward hurts the team **not because they cant replace Lebron, but because they have to expect other position players to fill a role which they are not accustomed to and plainly cannot fill**. They just brought in Markieff Morris to address this issue.   &gt; ""Lebron has wanted to play point guard for so long.  &gt; Let's play your game. Source your claim.""  Please refer to my quote from above.   &gt; ""Javale and Dwight can almost fill ADs role???You’re out of your mind lmao.  &gt; ""This is what you said:  &gt; ""If AD leaves the floor, Javale and Dwight can step in and play the center position.  &gt; Furthermore,  &gt; Lebron + Ad net rating: +11.35  &gt; Lebron without Ad net rating: +11.10  &gt; Ad without Lebron net rating: -2.16  &gt; https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612747&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=2544,203076  &gt; Those guys don’t even scoring 8 points a game.  &gt; It's not about the points it's the rebounding and defense. Lebron can take care of the offense. Ad can't.""  Again, I think youre just having trouble with comprehension. I said Javale and Dwight can play center. Jared Dudley is the only player that can naturally play small forward other than Lebron. I never said they can replace AD or replicate his production for the team. You said   &gt; ""Meanwhile, Ad's role can almost be filled by Javale and Dwight. AND It's not about the points it's the rebounding and defense.""   ADs role isnt just rebounding and defense so you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about if thats what you think. And even then AD is in the conversation for defensive player of the year. And you think Javale or Dwight can do that this season?? Thats insane.   &gt; ""Lebron + Ad net rating: +11.35  Lebron without Ad net rating: +11.10 Ad without Lebron net rating: -2.16""  This is the whole point of our conversation. Me explaining why the Lakers are built to play better with AD on the bench and not Lebron. You are just not comprehending.   &gt; Lebron can take care of the offense. Ad can't.  AD leads the team in scoring?? lmao. He is leading the team in scoring with 50,33,85 splits. AD is arguably a top 5 player in the league and also in the MVP conversation this year. Again you just dont seem like you know what you are talking about."
daily reminder that a kevin love perfect full court inbound to a lebron james one legged contested fadeaway outside of the court buzzerbeater kept wizards at 49 wins in 2017
" if I look at AD with  LeBron, Green and Javale(so the starters) on the court its  115.2 ORTG	106.0 DRTG  if you take LeBron, AD, Bradley and Green its a lot better at  111.7 ORTG	100.3 DRTG	  But then the .L. James, .J. McGee, .D. Green, .A. Bradley lineup without AD is basically the same defensively...  113.2 ORTG 100.5 DRTG, why is the defense still elite even when AD isn't on the court?  this was from 2-3 games ago, but I doubt the past 3 games have altered this much"
The used car salesman brother of LeBron James.
Lebron James has had games where he shot better from the 3 point line than the free throw line.
I really don’t give a fuck what you think. I’m sorry I thought lebron James not knowing what the coronavirus was 4 days ago is sort of a weak excuse.  I know this sub still thinks the entire season is going to go on like normal so I’m not surprised this is the response I’m getting.
"Most aren't generally considered to be a champion of social justice. This is a mantle he put on himself and a platform unlike any other. I'm not saying I would have done any different. I am a piece of shit. But, that isn't a good defense for what LeBron did. Not only did he decide NOT to defend the people if Hong Kong, he went further and even attacked someone who was brave enough to potentially suffer the consequences by speaking out against China. I am not saying James is that much worse than most others. I am saying he proved himself to be like every other self-serving person in that moment weighing money over what is right. He attacked those standing against a Communist regime and then refused to talk about it further in a tactical PR move to allow it to fade away. James has done so much more good in his life than me it isn't even funny. I am not negating any of the good he has done. But, his whole handling of the HK / China situation was a huge failure."
"https://twitter.com/damanr/status/1237194909527838720?s=19  &gt; Didn’t want to really say anything but it’s been bothering me: LeBron James just outplayed Kawhi Leonard and Giannis Antetokounmpo on both ends of the floor in back to back games, let’s stick to his basketball case about his MVP candidacy without invoking Kobe’s death, PLEASE  Exactly how I feel about it. It's disrespectful to both Kobe and LeBron."
"Well, in this case, you couldn’t possibly give the MVP award to LeBron ”I Cheated On My Wife” James"
"His offense is my only concern. He has some game where is really has zero aggression. Or his points just seem empty. He has been improving that. He is taking less 3s so that saves possessions. He just needs to find his right spots on the court and be efficient at it. Usually it’s the left post.   Rebounds also seem low but when your playing with Dwight Howard, JaVale McGee, LeBron James and Kyle Kuzma rebounds will be down."
your flair is lebron james lol
its been Lebron James day for 17 years
Is today Lebron James day?
ESPN: Lebron James doesn’t care about the Coronavirus. Wants others to figure it out for him.
"Lebron ""I play for the fans"" James would never skip a game working fans paid for"
"I don't want to get into a ... feud with Lebron James, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke"
"Adam Silver:  ""I don’t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Lebron James, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.”"
Only for LeBron James is basic human decency seen as a monumental achievement  https://www.dictionary.com/browse/decency
LeBron has been bought by china. Chairman James. Mao ZeBron
"LeBron spoke up while the players were in China and told Silver that he didn't think the players should be forced into position to speak on these issues.  Source: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27852687/inside-lebron-james-adam-silver-make-break-moments-china  Your moral leanings aside, this was clearly something positive within the locker room.  As for Kobe's death, LeBron was the one that called Silver and told him that the Lakers were not ready to play the Clippers game that was postponed. In the podcast they mentioned that the league was pushing for the Lakers to play."
"The list should be:  1. Giannis  Antetokounmpo 2. Lebron James  end of list.  The drop off from them and the rest of the pack is so astronomical it really doesn't make sense considering the rest of the list. If you want to talk about who are the top 10 players in the league right now, do the All-NBA run-down not the MVP race."
This is a false statement.   Not even a golden state fan but saying steph curry is a bad defender cause he had a tough time guarding Lebron James in the nba finals makes every player in the nba a bad defender. Apart from that one specific matchup he’s literally never had a problem defensively.   You are the one with revisionism.
"Sorry I didn’t add a citation for hyperbole, obviously there were people in existence who thought it, but generally, no, most people at the time didn’t have lebron as mvp.  You provided two Miami Heat writers and a piece by Henry Abbott that doesn’t talk about lebron James a single time."
Some people certainly were judging players using advanced metrics in 2011 and a decent number of people made the argument for LeBron.  [Source](https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/miamiheat/post/_/id/4755/a-closer-look-at-lebron-vs-d-rose-mvp-debate)  [Source](https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/miamiheat/post/_/id/4314/lebron-james-is-putting-mvp-voters-in-a-bind)  [Source](https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/24264/a-lame-apology-to-derrick-rose)
Anyone remember the video of some guy pointing out literally every single one of Lebron James’ mistakes in the 2011 finals against the Mavs ?? The guy had such a funny voice and you could hear how much he hated Lebron lmao.
"&gt; And they should treat this just like they treat any other contagious illness.  I’m sure they’d like to *but there isn’t a vaccine for this type of flu*.  Let me frame this for you. A highly contagious flu is spreading around, unchecked (because there is no vaccine), and teams can’t take normal precautions (because there is no vaccine), but they shouldn’t take otherwise mild and innocuous precautions to prevent star players from getting sick multiple weeks at a time (and possibly entire teams, because again, no vaccine, highly contagious)?  Do you think “Lebron James should just stay home for two weeks after he gets a fever and hope he didn’t infect the entire Lakers roster already” is a good decision for the NBA?  You’re not using common sense"
"I know this probably isn’t the example and he was probably using Kobe’s death in a irrational way... however one way Kobe’s death might impact this mvp race is the thought process that we should enjoy our greatness while we have it. James and Giannis regardless of their stats bring a very similar value to their respective team, and sometimes we have under appreciated individual season greatness of some of the greats to give parity to the mvp race but we all know there is a few extra mvps that Lebron could have on his mantal and the death of one of our greatest superstars is a reminder to not take greatness for granted"
"Well that’s a fair opinion.  But in terms of your latter portion, could that argument not be made for duos such as Magic/Kareem, LeBron/Wade and the Splash Bros as well? Respectively they had other key pieces as well. James Worthy, Chris Bosh, KD and Draymond."
LeBron James sets the pick-and-roll like i’m  LOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
put me in the queue for one LeBron James as well.
"And yet Lakers were predicted to barely win 50 games and have worse odds than the Jazz in the postseason before the season started. It's only recency bias that people can point to AD and say he's the reason Lebron can't win the MVP. Most people thought the Bucks would make it out of the East with the best record, no one besides Laker fans thought Lakers would be this good, hell, most Laker fans didn't think they'd be this good. Why is that? They knew AD was great, they didn't know Lebron would make AD *this* great, and they didn't know Vogel with the help of James, would commandeer such a stout defensive effort and that leadership comes from the top, something I don't hear anyone give Lebron credit for and another reason he should be considered MVP.   The Lakers have completely blown expectations out of the water, the Bucks are more or less doing what everyone thought they'd be doing, not to mention in a much easier conference with a much easier SOS(strengrh of schedule). It also helps Lebron is better than Giannis, we know who you'd rather have when it matters most."
If they're upset that he should be but won't be unanimous they'll really be mad when I state that anyone other than LeBron James winning it would be a travesty.
"Yeah I have, what’s your point?  He then says “He has the spotlight on him at all times. All the actual basketball life experiences Lebron James goes through should be taken into account”"
You must not know the media hype train Lebron has?  Check ESPN they are salivating at the thought of Lebron winning MVP. They already setting it up as a late run for Lebron James.
"There are enough games left to drastically change things but if the season ended today I'd have it as:  All-NBA 1st team:   F - Giannis Antetokounmpo, F - LeBron James, C - Nikola Jokic, G - James Harden, G - Luka Doncic  All-NBA 2nd team:  F - Kawhi Leonard, F - Anthony Davis, C - Joel Embiid, G - Damian Lillard, G - Russell Westbrook  All-NBA 3rd team:  F - Khris Middleton, F - Jayson Tatum, C - Rudy Gobert, G - Chris Paul, G - Trae Young"
Awesome vid! Did you read Mike Prada’s article as well? [SBNation](http://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2020/3/9/21170900/los-angeles-lakers-vs-clippers-lebron-james-kawhi-leonard-paul-george-defense-adjustment)

"If Kawhi was named LeBron James, Curry wouldn’t have been unanimous that year."
dont know why you’re getting downvotes the kid is 20 years old and is averaging Lebron James stats. To say he could be a floor general when he hits his prime in 8 YEARS doesnt seem so farfetched to me
Lebron James is the French version of Bron James.
"From this point forward, we should always refer to LeBron James as LeBron James, Apex Predator.  Whenever somebody says his name, it should always be, LeBron James, Apex Predator."
Ok but whoever heard of LeBron James anyway?
"Because every team...And you must remember this--every team that James lands on, does not have 'enough' pieces.  He can have Wade, AD, and Bosh and it's, ""He needs more shooters"", or something to that effect.   The reality is neither player, AD or Lebron, at this stage in their careers, can carry a team to the promised land. AD because he just hasn't shown that he can, and Lebron due to age.   Giannis will win because look what's happening with his team when he isn't there. 1x All-Star, CHRIS MIDDLETON is the second best player on the team.   &amp;#x200B;  IMO, if you can't get it done when you have 2 HOF players on the roster, and one of them is supposedly the best Player in the World, then I don't know what to tell you."

Our own president isn’t speaking out against human rights and you’re concerned about Lebron James lol.
"If Lebron goes to the finals with this lakers team, he will have been to 9 NBA finals over the last 10 seasons across 3 different franchises, each time with completely different casts of characters.   Giannis hasn’t proven he can make the finals once and appears to struggle when defenses cut off his driving lanes.  To say any player is more valuable than Lebron James is laughable. He is arguably the single most valuable player in the history of the NBA."
"Lebron ""Hunter"" James x Lou ""Huntee"" Williams"
"he is kinda right,you cannot pretend to be the man when you play along Lebron James."
because LeBron James
Stop it. AD is playing with Lebron fucking James.
"oh ffs. ""theyll go to other plays"". you literally dont understand basketball like fucking hell man. defenses dictate what the offense runs, ESPECIALLY IN PLAYOFF BASKETBALL. when james harden gets doubled or hedged on every possession he HAS to pass to the open man and rely on the open man to execute. When lebron gets hedged or doubled on hes way too smart to not pass to the open man.   bro your dumbass take is the lakers have some magic plays for the playoffs. you god damn idiot every team knows each others plays. theres no magic plays. it comes down to execution. i trust lebron to make the right passes when teams double. i have doubts in avery bradley and the boys"
Rookie LeBron james. Imagine if the Cavs are well equipped with a coach that knows how to coach. Jesus
Remember when Morris [said he was a great defender](https://sports.yahoo.com/marcus-morris-says-hes-probably-best-nba-defending-lebron-james-beside-kawhi-leonard-222533568.html) for Lebron?
"Biggest winner would defintely be James Harden. Darly Morey would probably petition the league to give them the title due to some analytics. But James would have no chance of blowing another ring and all his fans will use this as evidence on WHY if the refs didn't suck game 7, the Warriors didn't exist, and the coronavirus that James Harden would have multiple championships.   Biggest Loser: LeBron. no need to explain."
"Psh, Lakers are a bunch of pansies. They're just gonna prounce around come playoffs time, LeBron with his man-purse and AD with his contract not being the only thing he's willing to extend for LeBron... The Rockets will smash them in the playoffs, MARK my words, son.   As for the Clippers? They're gonna be tough to beat, no doubt. Playoff Kahwi is am animal. The good news is they'll only go as far as Patrick Beverly can take them, and that's not good enough to beat the Rockets. James Harden is preparing to break up with his girlfriend, so harden and Westbrook will be rounding into MVP status at the same time just in time to win a ring. You heard it here, son."
Even though it’s not a common saying but...  Lebron James with no regard for human life
"Lmfao your entire comment history has been dedicated to hating Lebron James. You've been calling him ""Chairman James"" and ""Dumbass James"".That alone makes your arguments invalid and qualifies you as an irrational Lebron hater crybaby. If you're gonna troll, at least try to hide the fact that you're butthurt."
"I just listened to the fucking NBA tv commentators talk about LeBron James for like 20 minutes straight, instead of doing their fucking job and actually talking about what's going on with the game. The media hype over LeBron is blown way out of proportion to a point where it is impacting even other games' commentating. It's important for this issue to be brought to light, and for a solution to be found soon so that we don't have to hear about the kInG in every portion of our waking lives"
"Y’all really think Lebron James, winner of 4 MVPS and three finals MVPS,  is paying Rachel Nichols and Dave McMenamin to say that bullshit."
"oh the response was not even meant for you. I'm bad at Reddit sigh  But I still disagree with your premise, we all like/appreciate the talent of Klay and Dray. Absolutely talented players, but there is a reason Steph Curry won the MVP award unanimously in 16. He absolutely makes them go(as a team). Even with the addition of KD, they were not the same team when Steph is out. Stats and eye test show it. Just like Lebron nowadays. There were calls for Steph to get MVP, but no way were they gonna give it to him. And I agree with this.   All I'm looking for is the same energy. Especially when Giannis is literally entering uncharted waters with his consistent freaky performances.  Some folks here are reducing AD to a Khris Middleton level star just to prop up king James. That's .. ew, no okayy."
Why did James harden get it over LeBron when he had Chris Paul.
"if you think LeBron James, the dude who spends 2 million a year on random bullshit to stay at top performance is taking the same peds as Jahlil Okafor you got another thing coming."
"Because Lonzo is one of my favorite players and he plays the PG position at a very high level. You could see how great he was in high school. While other people have been thinking about Lavar, BBB and whatever the fuck, ive been watching this kid ball the fuck out consistently.   Lonzo ball had a triple double while playing next to Lebron. Do you realize how hard it is to be that effective next to a ball dominant player like Lebron? Why don't james Harden and Westbrook get triple doubles together? Because they don't see the game the way lonzo does. And that is going to take this pelicans team to the finals. I'm not gonna put money on it, but this team is built perfectly for lonzo."
1. Lebron James Harden 2. Rest
"1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. Magic Johnson 5. Larry Bird 6. Wilt Chamberlain 7. Bill Russell 8. Hakeem Olajuwon 9. Tim Duncan 10. Shaquille O'Neal  I probably have the order wrong in some places, but I think all the players are correct."
"Ones the greatest of all time, the other is LeBron James"
"OP, Look no farther.  Also, AD is riding the coat tails of Lebrons MVP season, not the other way around. Just look at their individual success and playoff runs without each other.  Steph and KD are way more comparable talents from a post season relevancy separate from their time together.  Can’t say that about AD and LeBron.  James is the difference without a doubt for that’s teams position and success."
"His name is Lebron James.  But to be fair, it goes:   1. Lebron  2. Curry/KD  3. Curry/KD  4. Kawhi Giannis maybe Harden and AD  It's not the same thing"
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.   &amp;nbsp;   I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.   &amp;nbsp;   I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.   &amp;nbsp;   and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.   &amp;nbsp;   I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.   &amp;nbsp;   he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?"" and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?   &amp;nbsp;   I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now..... until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..   &amp;nbsp;   edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her"
"Don't let the king James fan boy see this. I bet you, KD would be a role player if he joined the Lakers just so lebron stays the king in their world."
Man I can not get enough LeBron James and Lakers talk.  Especially when we talk about them for an entire quarter of a basketball game that neither of them are apart of
"The Warriors had Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green.  The Lakers have Lebron James &amp; Anthony Davis. It's that simple. Your desperate attempts to make the Warriors look like a duo team is stupid."
"A) Lebron has a prominent impact on the personnel of a team, ok fine. Every superstar does, we just saw the nets recently fire their playoff proven coach because the stars involved didn’t wanna play for him. But to imply that this inherently restricts teams from signing or making trades for competent ball handlers isn’t accurate.   B) cap space does get eaten up but that where the ability to make additional trades comes in, Houston was capped out as well and guess what? They traded for guys that they felt addressed the needs of the team, and I guarantee you that James Harden has as much power in Houston as Lebron does in LA  C) ok make it Fred van fleet, I was more so referring to the cavs with CP3 instead of Kyrie"
"Doesn't matter if you're a physical specimen and have an insane calorie output.   When it comes to diet/nutrition, it's not necessarily about what junk you eat, it's about how much. Hockey players, swimmers, and a lot of other athletes eat a lot of trash/big meals because they need the calories. That's why a lot of athletes end up with dad bods after their careers too.    Considering how much of a freak LeBron is he probably has some genetic disposition that gives him a faster than average metabolism at his age or has a harder time getting fat or some shit.  In theory, so long LeBron is playing 30+ minutes a night he can probably eat more junk than the average person and not be affected because he's fucking LeBron James."
"A few years ago, LeBron did a [no carbs/sugar/dairy nutrition plan](https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-sugar-carbs-diet-2014-9) for a couple of months and got pretty lean."
I just realized that I might be LeBron James.
"***The Stupid Human Feats of Strength category …***  **Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors, four-time Finals adversary**: A couple years back, when (the Cavs) played Boston and they went to Game 7, that’s the year Kyrie got traded. They went down 3-2 and I was talking to my assistant coach from high school. He was like, “They done! LeBron’s done! They ain’t getting to the Finals!”  I told him, “This is exactly how it’s going to go. LeBron’s going to play 48 minutes, he’s going to walk the ball up the floor, he’s only going to take a fast break if they’ve got a dead layup, and if not, he’ll walk the ball up the floor and control the entire pace of the game and they’ll win in a low-scoring game.” That’s how it was going to go.  He kept saying, “They’re done! I’m telling you.” He called me at halftime of Game 7, “Yo, how’d you know this? This is going exactly how you said it was going to go!”  That story is so interesting to me because I don’t think there’s ever been a player in basketball who can control an entire 48 minutes of a game. It’s unheard of. To be able to see him do that is outrageous.  **Brandon Ingram, New Orleans Pelicans, former Lakers teammate**: It was maybe our first workout, we were playing pickup our first training camp practice. I think we were going to 20. If I recall, I think he scored all 20 points. Pulling up from halfcourt, shooting fadeaways behind the glass, attacking the basket, backing up all our bigs. Floaters in the lane, everything. It was crazy.  It was our whole team. I forget who was on his team. I’m not sure if I was on his team. But I remember him scoring all 20 points. And it was like, every shot he took we knew it was going in. From halfcourt. The ball was going out of bounds from the opposite way he shoots. He turned, fades away, the opposite way, knocks it down, and runs down the court like he practiced that shot. That was like his 15th point probably. So I’m sure, after that, his confidence is, not that he needed confidence, but it was sky high at this point and he took advantage of every single opportunity.  **Kyle Korver, Milwaukee Bucks, former Cavs teammate:** One of the years in the playoffs, we’d always do those things, the Versaclimber, because there would always be seven to 10 days between series. We’d do these team cardio challenges, like relay challenges. That’s kind of my thing. Like, I can go. I can’t go that fast all the time, but I can go for a really long time.  So we do this challenge, and I have never thrown up from doing cardio. And I am just, I feel like I might throw up. There’s those benches on the side of the court, and I’m like keeled over. “Bring the stretcher.” LeBron walked off the Versaclimber, onto the court, gets the ball, looks at the far basket, *full sprint* goes at it, jumps from outside the charge circle and windmill dunks it. And I’m like keeled over, trying to breathe, doing something that’s like *what I do.* And this dude windmill dunks it.  That is the most amazing thing I have ever seen anyone do. It was unbelievable. I was like, “This guy is from a different world.” His team might’ve won the relay. He went hard, and he worked before that, too. Everybody was gasping. I looked at Channing (Frye) like, “That was amazing.”  **Mike Brown, Golden State Warriors assistant, former Cavs coach:** Probably in Detroit, the playoff game where he had like 25 points in a row (Game 5, 2007 Eastern Conference finals). I kind of caught myself watching as a fan as opposed to a coach at that particular time. I remember Detroit took a timeout and we came together in the huddle as coaches, and I remember Mike Malone was like, “You gotta tell…” And I was like, “No, no, no. Mike, we’re not telling LeBron anything. We’re going to leave him alone and let him keep doing his thing.” And so I waited to enter the huddle until basically the timeout was over, and I went in and said, “Keep doing what you’re doing.”  **Stan Van Gundy, broadcaster, former playoff rival coach**: I wouldn’t call this a “favorite”’ because it seems like he was always kicking our ass! The one I remember most was the 2009 Eastern Conference finals, Game 2, in Cleveland. We were up by two and they had one last play on the side, out of bounds. I don’t remember exactly how much time was left but it was less than two seconds.  Mike Brown had a play where James would fake coming off a pindown and back cut for a lob. We were ready for it, and Hedo Turkoglu took away the lob. So James came off the pindown and hit a long 3 to beat us. Was that the best game-winner of his career? I should have had our defender on the ball tracking and denying James but I didn’t. That play has haunted me because every year since, it has been shown on TV ads hyping the playoffs.  **Drew Gooden, Washington Wizards TV analyst, former Cavs teammate:** After shootaround one day during that 2006-07 run to go to the Finals, we were standing about right here (near the sideline, inside Cleveland’s arena). There was a small, half-empty water bottle. One of the small water bottles, not the large one, the small one. LeBron bet everybody he could throw that small water bottle into section 209 over there (about 150 feet away, per arena dimensions and the Cavs PR staff, and into the second deck).  We were like, “There’s no way you can throw this little tiny water bottle that was halfway full to the 200s.” Sure enough, he hit the slot like Joe Montana. He took a couple steps forward and he launched that small water bottle and hit the glass facing of the (upper deck). Just to get that close, of almost getting it there, it was enough said. I said, “You know what? That’s the greatest basketball player who ever lived.” And it had nothing to do with a ball. It wasn’t a money bet, it was more like a gentlemen’s bet. We used to do things like that. Can you throw this or can you hit that object? He likes to have fun with that. When he did that, not only does he have the best arm in the league, he’s the best basketball player in the world being able to throw that water bottle that high.  **Mike Miller, University of Memphis assistant coach, former Cavs and Heat teammate:** The greatest game I ever witnessed in my life was Game 6 at Boston (with the Heat in the 2012 conference finals). His mentality before the game, that was basically the first time I ever saw him go into a game being as aggressive as possible offensively. That was the best game I’ve ever witnessed with my own two eyes. It was the second year we were there after losing the first year in the Finals. It’s my favorite story because you lose that game (the Heat were facing elimination), you never know. There’s going to be changes. Behind that game was a lot more than just the game. There’s defining moments in everything. If something goes different, what happens with the Heat going forward? Guys like me and Shane (Battier), there’s a lot of different changes that have to be made.  That’s the best individual performance I’ve ever seen ever. Just being there and seeing it. He had that look and he was as loose as I’ve ever seen him. He was locked in, relaxed and free. He basically looked at us like, “We’ve got it.” He said, “We’re going to be fine. I got you all.” I said, “Thank you. I appreciate that.” *(LeBron scored 45 points with 15 rebounds at TD Garden and the Heat won, forcing a Game 7 Miami also won en route to another Finals and eventual championship.)*  **John Lucas, Houston Rockets assistant coach, Cavs coach when LeBron was in high school:** I had Kobe when he was young. So everybody kept telling me there was a guy, and this guy is better than Kobe Bryant. So I went to an AAU game at Christmas, and I stayed eight hours. I saw him play the first game, and couldn’t stop watching. And the next time I saw LeBron, I said, “You might be as good as Bimbo Coles.” He couldn’t stop laughing. The other is he came to practice with our team (while still in high school) and I got suspended two games for it, and he won’t give me my money. They charged $50,000 and I still asked for it. I don’t seem to get a response. He was the best player in the gym that day, on my team. Ricky Davis, Chris Mihm, DeSagana Diop, all of our players, he was the best player there."
"LeBron James never loses at cards. *Ever*. He drowns his mountain of french toast in syrup and strawberries. And you should hear about his “Romeo and Juliet” project from freshman year English class.  Ahead of LeBron’s 16th NBA All-Star Game this Sunday*, The Athletic* polled a number of his current and former teammates, coaches, front-office executives, banana boat riders, rivals, school teachers and childhood friends, with this question: *What’s your favorite LeBron story?*  Not everyone approached wanted to participate, leery of speaking on The King. Or something like that. But those who did gave us, and you, something to appreciate.  ***What he’s like***  **Kendrick Perkins, TV analyst, former Cavs teammate:** There’s one thing about LeBron. For some reason, when we play cards, he is really just the Chosen One. I’ve never seen him lose at anything. We will be playing cards and I’d be like, “Who won?’ He’d be like, “Shit, not me. I lost,” and he’d try to put it on somebody else, but he’d have all the cash in his hand. Like he would never lose. I’ve never seen him take an “L.” It was crazy. He’d never lose and I told him, “You’re just the Chosen One. And then like, everything you touch is gold.” I don’t know what it is about him, but he always wins.  **Jared Dudley, Los Angeles Lakers, current teammate**: You know how big he is over here in the States. In China (last September) we had a players-only dinner at, I think, Morton’s Steakhouse inside the hotel. We go up there and he’s telling stories about last year’s team and this year, and getting us all ready. We leave, and when we leave, we go down the elevator (of the restaurant, inside the Ritz-Carlton in Shanghai). There might have been 4,000 people chanting his name. And they rushed the elevator to get through; security couldn’t hold everyone back. And one of Kyle Kuzma’s managers was trying to hold people back, and the weight of the people pushing was so much, he basically dislocated his shoulder and had to have surgery.  … And they kept chanting his name, “King James, King James.” I even got a video of it early on because I was behind him. And I was like, it was so crazy, they were rushing him. … It was mayhem. That’s when I knew this year would be special. I’ve never played with anyone, even though Jordan drafted me, I’ve never played with anyone else that would have something like that.  **Tristan Thompson, Cleveland Cavaliers, former Cavs teammate:** He has the worst fucking diet ever. Ask him what he eats for breakfast. He has like five french toast, drowns it in syrup with strawberries and bananas. Then he has like a four-egg omelette and then he goes and just fucking dunks on somebody. It doesn’t make sense.  He eats desserts with every meal. He’ll come with his one-week diet, vegan crap, but he literally eats like it doesn’t make sense. He’s really a specimen. He eats like shit. I remember one year I tried to eat like he ate and it just didn’t work out. I started gaining weight and said, “Fuck this.” I mean it works for him. He loves sweets. He loves sweets. He eats desserts and French toast. It’s crazy how his body just burns it.  **Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers, current teammate:** He’s just a big ol’ kid. You wouldn’t know it unless you’re his teammate or you’re around him a lot, but he’s a big kid. He’s high on life, loves life, lives his life to the fullest. I get to see that every day. Win, lose or draw, he’s got a smile on his face — maybe a little bit after the loss — but he’s got a smile on his face. He’s just happy to still be able to do what he’s doing at a high level and be around his team and support his son.  His son is going through a lot, he’s going through a lot, has a lot going on. (LeBron) just enjoys it all. He’s never upset; he’s never angry at anyone. … Obviously, you hear people say, “Oh, it’s tough being his teammate,” or stuff like that. And like I said, I was never his teammate. All-Star games are different. USA teams are different. But to be his teammate for the number of games that we’ve been so far, I haven’t seen any of those things. He’s always setting up team dinners. He’s about the team, and he’s always making us laugh.  **Lloyd Pierce, Atlanta Hawks head coach, former Cavs assistant:** As a coach, you’re constantly trying to get your guys to lock in. You’re going over the scout in the morning and lock in, meaning we’re walking at 50 percent or 40 percent, but we want your mind. So we want you in position and what you need to do on a screen.  And LeBron never pays attention. Never pays attention. So as you’re telling him to walk, he’s over here talking and rapping, he’s dancing. And you’re going through the play, and then when someone messes up, all of a sudden, he’s like, “You’ve got to be in position.” And he hits you with, “That needs to be a hedge. And we’re going to rotate over here.” But the whole time, he’s been rapping and talking. But he knows the play and he knows where everyone is supposed to be. And all he has to do is glance and see (someone else) make a false step.  And this is where he’d blow your mind. “We played Indiana three years ago in the playoffs and in that third quarter they came out and ran power zoom and we tried to hedge that and they hurt us with that. We ain’t hedging tonight.” My first year he would do stuff like that. Not only would he say, “I don’t want to hedge. I don’t want to do that coverage.” He’d tell you why and then he’d reference the game when they tried that coverage and how they got beat.  “We tried that hedge with Austin Croshere and Austin Croshere was picking and popping and we were late rotating over. We’re not hedging that tonight.” From two years ago, third-quarter action. That was my first instance of, “This dude’s different.” And that isn’t even the physical stuff. This dude’s different."
"Comparing injuries between the teams is a joke. If LeBron had missed as many games as Leonard has, the Lakers would be fighting for the third seed. Each of Leonard and George have missed more games than Davis and James combined. And yeah, injuries are an argument because we're comparing them at full strength."
Confirmation bias—here were the top-selling jerseys in 18-19:   01. LeBron James  02. Stephen Curry  03. Giannis Antetokounmpo  04. Kyrie Irving  05. Joel Embiid  06. James Harden  07. **Russell Westbrook**  08. Kevin Durant  09. Ben Simmons  10. Jimmy Butler  11. Dwyane Wade  12. Paul George  13. Luka Doncic  14. Damian Lillard  15. Jayson Tatum
"The Lakers are in the business of fielding superstar talent. They don’t seem to worried about what 99% of the league thinks about their recruitment effort.   You can bitch and moan about your personal beliefs about whether or not paying Kobe was worth it, but Anthony Davis and Lebron James both play for the Lakers now. They both did not play for the Lakers 2 years ago.   Maybe they made a good decision."

"Or maybe he genuinely doesn't know a damn thing about the impetus behind the protests in Hong Kong and didn't really want to get involved. I'd wager that half of you who partake in this performative armchair woke-ness about Hong Kong don't know anything about the situation there. The fact is the Hong Kong protests are, at least in part, a way for westerners to feel good about the expansion of western capitalist ideals and make it seem like some kind of freedom fight. Xi Jinping and his regime ARE fascists and should be removed from power, but Hong Kong is a weird canary for that coal mine. How about the re-education camps filled with Uyghur Muslims? Tibet? Why the fuck does everyone start caring once the westernized, hyper-corporate mecca of Hong Kong is the region under the lens? Because western corporate interests want us to care about it.   We get to feel like activists for calling Lebron James a bootlicker or deleting our Blizzard accounts, but we have done absolutely fucking nothing and this type of performance doesn't actually hurt the Xi Jinping regime at all. Which really bums me out, obviously."

"Do you really think his dietician or nutritionist is with him 24/7?  lol.    It's like visiting the doctor, they tell you what to do to stay healthy, and they're not going to be hovering over you 24/7 .. regarding his chefs, they're going to make whatever the fuck Lebron James wants them to make."
People think 6'8 240 pound superathlete Lebron James is gonna get his calorie intake with brussel sprouts and broccoli. Man probably needs 5000 calories a day to keep his mass. You need a cheat meal in there to fill you out 😂
"No.  but this hypothetical is completely impossible. No chance a player on a 10 win team has advanced stats like that.   Lebron James cpuld singlehandedly drag just about any NBA roster ever in the history of the NBA to a better season that. Even the Process Sixers struggled to be that bad and they didn't have a superstar. You can't be an MVP player in the NBA and simulteneously be incapable of helping your team win more than 10 games outnof 82.  I get that this is a hypothetical and saying it will never happen isn't really the point, but it kinda just breaks all the known ""rules"" of statistical analysis and player evaluation. As a thought exercise it doesnt really prove anything about the value of great individual stats vs the value of being on a winning team."
You’re correct. His chefs specifically keep him away from red meat. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/how-lebron-james-spends-money-body-care-2018-7%3famp  This convo with TT is sus to say the least
"Yeah, I find this convo with TT super hard to believe after all that’s been reported year after year about how dedicated lebron is to taking care of his body and his diet to continue his career as long as possible. It seems like a once in a generational work ethic and will power to constantly pass on delicious foods, but that’s how I always thought of lebron - as someone who cares so much about his legacy that he’d do it.   If you google it, article after article comes up, which is what you’re referring to, about how he spends upwards of $2mil a year on his body and that includes personal chefs that keep him away from red meats and sweets.    https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/how-lebron-james-spends-money-body-care-2018-7%3famp  And that only makes sense. No one can have the longevity of lebron with how perfect his body is if they are eating like shit."

"There is a probability list for if people will make the HoF or not that was made by people that really know their stuff and Dwight Howard was more likely to make the HoF than LeBron James until 3 years ago. Now with all these historic seasons Curry,Russ,Harden,CP3,Lebron are all more likely to make it than Dwight but Dwight hasn't been himself in half a decade and they are still barely a higher percentage chance."
hope you ready for a really fat retired Lebron James.

So you actually think Lebron James eats healthy everyday?  Doesn't he own a pizza chain?  You people are dense thinking all these athletes eat healthy everyday.smh
2018 was absurd to watch. It felt like LeBron James just took over every series he played.
Dwight Howard was bullying jokic all game which made James job easier defensively. Lebron was engaged on both sides of the ball. Playoff Bron.
I love how Laker fans are calling out the travels when Lebron James get away with 97% of those calls 😂😂
"I wanted to add some stuff about the '03 draft to put this even more in perspective.    First, Iguodala was drafted in '04, not '03.  Vince carter was drafted in '98.  A full 5 years before Lebron and Lebron still has more mileage.  Of the 2003 draft class, only 3 players are still in the league.  Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Kyle Korver.  It's just absolutely crazy to think about how the second best player from that draft, a future hall of famer and all time great, Dwyane Wade is already retired...meanwhile Lebron is still playing as one of the top 3 best players in the entire world."
"When Mark Jackson is commentating, his usual line when talking about a player/coach in question is: 'if I'm LeBron James I'm looking to attack the rim', or 'if I'm Steven Adams I make the free throw'.

"Exactly, thanks for proving his point. Are we taking LeBron fucking James in the playoffs and AD (who also is an insane playoff performer in the three series he’s had), or the two youngins who have 0 experience. We beat them in the regular season handedly, so by that precedent we should thrash them in the playoffs.   “Playoff ball is different” would make sense if you were arguing for LeBron losing in a regular season match up, not against him."
"&gt;Luke empowered the young guys and developed Brandon's playmaking a lot, so idk where you're pulling this shit from  Yeah that's why they played better after leaving the team. We also lost games while they were benched and decreased their value to the point we straight up renounced Randle and used DLo for a salary dump. That's like the reverse of killing two birds with one stone.  I get some older fans like that tough love Byron Scott approach to young players but Luke is currently on his second team proving that it just doesn't work with him.  &gt;why tf would he be playing Isaac Bonga on a Lebron James team?  Because that team was horribly constructed (thanks Magic) and badly needed 3pt shooters? Guess what all those guys I mentioned are?  &gt;The players you are referring to are all super young.  I guess you missed the part about misusing Lopez (who, no surprise there, also played way better on another team) check out Lou's numbers for us and compare them to those he's putting up for the Clippers. Same with guys on the Kings.  &gt;This whole thing reads like you're writing a HS essay and need to meet a word count  It was a reddit post made out of bullet points if that 'reads like an essay' to you, you need to pay more attention in class."
"&gt; benching Randle for half a season in favor of Larry Nance. Benching DLo and Ingram as well (that good ol Byron Scott method of coaching youngsters)  You're way off here. Benching Randle actually worked amazingly and he somehow turned Ju into a plus defender. Luke empowered the young guys and developed Brandon's playmaking a lot, so idk where you're pulling this shit from  &gt; barely playing Thomas Bryant, Wagner, Bonga and Svi (all those * dudes are currently rotation players)  Do I really even have to address this lol...why tf would he be playing Isaac Bonga on a Lebron James team? Who cares if they're *now* rotation players on bad teams?? This is terrible logic.  &gt; almost every single player playing significantly better after leaving the team aside from his favorite Larry Nance  That's not evidence of him being a bad coach whatsoever. The players you are referring to are all super young. Why would a guy like D'lo, who was *20 years old* when he last played for us, be worse at 22? This whole thing reads like you're writing a HS essay and need to meet a word count, so you just ignore the whole ""making sense"" part. Also, Randle got worse after, he just increased his volume.   You're right about the rest. Luke was a bad coach for us and is pretty bad overall, but much of what you wrote shows that you don't know what you're talking about."

They traded Lebron James from Clevland to the LA Lakers
"Why do you think the ratings are down, NBA?   Could it be that with a premier national TV game, featuring 3 game-changing players, 1 being LeBron James, that your broadcast featured a creepy Jodie Foster story, officiating that both teams could rightly complain about, constant college basketball references and announcers knowing very little about the 2nd best team in the West for the second straight season?"
Lebron James never lost in college
"1st team: Dame, Harden, James, Giannis, Jokic | 2nd team: luka, Westbrook, Davis, Leonard, embiid| 3rd team: walker or Lowry (couldn’t decide), cp3, butler, siakam, Gobert NOTES: Kawhi missed too many games to put him over LeBron, Simmons could also be there team but Lowry and walker have better team records, I’m count Davis as a forward because McGee and Howard get most the laker mins at Center"
No size thats will b their weakness offensive rebounds and stopping james and davis in the paint. They have perimeter defenders but lebron driving to the paint they still cant do anything kawhi has the best chance. The first game was pointless the 2nd game looked better. We will have to see what the playoffs bring its just a different ball game at that point.
Clippers will have a size issue which is lebron and ad best skill set. But they literally built there team to try and stop lebron james. Clearly a better team overal the lakers length will b a issue for the clippers in a 7 game playoff series. Ill take in tip ins and offense rebounds over the clippers guarxs shooting tough shots

To say that this team that is currently first in the standings should not be expected to win the championship with lebron james who is supposedly this player who is like Michael Jordan to me is ridiculous.
Higher career three point percentage than LeBron James. Just sayin.
"If the lakers don't win this year, lebron james is even more of a joke in all time conversations. This dude is not all comparable to Jordan. He has no argument aside from padded individual stats in a team sport. And for people to say that lebron has no help even on this laker team WITH AD where he's averaging plenty of assists because he has teammates who hit their shots... it's just ridiculous.     I'm sure lebron is a fine person, but this other stuff is getting ridiculous."
"How can lebron james simultaneously be seen as one of the greatest of all time, like a top 5 kind of player, and yet we're not calling the lakers the favorites right now to win the championship. How can that possibly be?"
"What do you mean? We were practically undefeated for the first part of the season. You know, for a lot of people who try to make the argument that lebron james is the goat and yet never expect this dude to win the championship."

He probably likes LeBron James. Let him know that Paul pierce and the big 3 dethroned king James and show him the banners.
I've said it before and I'll say it again.  No one has beaten the Raptors in a 7 game series without Lebron James since 2015
Kings would never sign Lebron James because he would take the ball out of fox’s hands
"You know, Hassan Whiteside being just a hair below LeBron James in this metric makes me really question how effective it is..."
Tell him that #36 is LeBron James
"5th in VORP, 6th in BPM, 3rd best player in the league according to 538's Raptor.   Lebron is unquestionably having a fantastic season, although it's a typical Lebron season by his standards.   The short and simple answer for why he's having an MVP caliber season is that he's essentially top 5ish statistically, and his team commands the best record in a tough eastern conference.  Lebron is very distant in this convo or not even in it at all if the Lakers are a 4 seed or lower. But the team is solidly at the top of the conference, and has been for most of the year.   MVP isn't just stats, it's also the concept of ""value"" which tbh is subjective.  But Lakers fans will tell you that Lebron provides an absurd amount of value for this team, far beyond what the stats show. It's all the little things he does, how easily he can read plays, how he always makes the right decision, etc etc. And we all know the Lakers without Bron look like ass, though a big part of that is lacking a good secondary ball handler.  So yeah.   Top 5 in terms of stats (box score + advanced).  Best player on the second best team in the league, the best team in the West.  And he's Lebron James at age 35, so that gives him a good boost too.  EDIT: But even despite that I think Lebron is at best a distant 2nd in this MVP race. Giannis has run away with it to an absurd degree. He's unquestionably the best player on a historically great regular season team putting up the best stats of his whole career, improving on his first MVP season, on fewer minutes.  Fingers crossed for a playoffs collapse, cause thats about the only thing fans of the 29 other teams can hope for now lol."
did you say davis is the most complete player with lebron james next to him???
"&gt; The Suns are also 10-13 when Ayton plays this year and I wouldn't say the Mavs' roster is ways ahead of the Suns.  None of that is on Ayton. When Ayton plays he makes his team over [7 points per 100 possessions](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4446/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) better when on the court.  He has a [4.3 net rating](https://stats.nba.com/player/1629028/) when he is on the court. Considering how bad his team is this is huge. Ayton is in the top 25th percentile at improving his teams offense.... and in the top 25th percentile at improving his teams defense. Despite having Jrue as his teamate AD wasn't able to carry his team to the playoffs. It takes more than two players to carry a team. I wish Curry didn't get hurt this year because he was going to be another example under my belt of a single person not being able to carry a team despite how great he is because everyone agrees how great Curry is. He sure wasn't able to carry his team before he was hurt...  Luka Doncic has very very mediocre [on/off numbers](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4432/onoff#tab-team_efficiency). He wasn't even a positive last year.  Here are some stars on/off numbers. [Lebron James](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/1785/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) Usually 10+ every single year and has never been a negative. [Giannis Antetokounmpo](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/96/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) positive every year and never been a negative.  Ayton looks more like these stars, not Luka. Ayton has helped his team on both sides of the ball... Both years he has been in the league.  Luka Doncic has insanely high USG rate and gets really high box score numbers. He also has really high uncontested rebound rates. He gets a ton of credit in box office based advanced metrics and has let to him getting overrated when much of that credit goes to the rest of his team. If Mavs didn't have Luka but a decent PG instead maybe like Spencer Dinwiddie level I am convinced the Mavs would be like the Clippers or Nets of last year where they were a 42-46 win team and barely make the playoffs but have no stars. Don't get me wrong, I think Luka is a good but think he is severly overrated. Me comfortably rating Ayton over him is more to do with how Amazing Ayton has been rather than Doncic being bad because he is not."
"He is clearly not putting in any effort defensive for majority of the game he’s playing this season.   This is almost objective at this point.   No shit Lebron can control the game better than Davis with the current line up, the entire team is built completely around him. Lebron’s impact offensive was one of the lowest in his career LAST season when the team wasn’t built around him.   This is why I have absolutely no toleration for stupidity. The notion that without Lebron James, a team lead by a healthy prime AD is a lottery team is absolutely hilarious.   Get your head out of the gutter. He may as well be the best player in the playoffs, but there’s no way you can STRONGLY argue that he’s the best player on his team."
Of course there are actual human beings who believes Lebron James have been playing great defense this season.   My fucking god
"Drpm constitutes mix of defensive rapm and defensive bpm.   Defensive bpm for most perimeter players are hot garbage, and Lebron’s on/off is clearly inflated by mixture of AD and Howard lineups.   The fact that there are people here claiming or even arguing “Lebron James has been playing amazing defense” is absolutely unbelievable.   No, Lebron James it not even close to being a top defender in the league. And of course you refuse to point out the hypocrisy that Lebron has the highest rpm but you admit Davis is clearly the better defender. This is clearly  because of lineup functions.   To illustrate simply:   Lebron plays with AD, the defensive rating is great.   Lebron plays with Howard, the defensive rating is great.   Rapm, because of lack of high samples, now believed that it’s because of LEBRON that the lineup’s defense is stable.   Because Lebron is getting substituted by awful defenders, lebron’s value is getting overrated while AD’s and Howard’s are getting downplayed."
"As a bitter Cavs fan that year, I was all-in on the Pacers and thought verticality was like the secret key to beating LeBron James and being a contender. I remember all these TNT replays of Hibbert contesting LeBron.   Then it all fell apart rather quickly."
"I'd say using Lebron James as the example is pretty telling. People also win after the 26-30 age range, they just generally don't do it before it. I can't think of a championship team who's best two players were younger than their prime. I could very well be wrong, but nothing comes to mind."
"1. MJ  2. Lebron  3. KAJ  4. Shaq  5. Magic  6. Bird  7. Wilt  8. Hakeem  9. Tim Duncan  He's for sure not a better player than them.  Then we get into the David Robinson, Oscar Robertson argument, both of whom are kind of forgotten older guys. And then guys like Steph who get underrated because they're actively playing and aren't LeBron James.  If Kobe was top 10 he was 10th."
"They got to the Finals and lost to the LeBron James Miami Heat yet they couldn’t play them together? And saying they drafted Cameron Payne as a “solution” is so uninformed lol but you’re clearly a nephew so it doesn’t even warrant wasting time to correct. Easy to trash draft picks with 20/20 hindsight. They definitely should have just drafted another James Harden after trading him. Wow, Presti sure is a clown."
"Everytime I read articles from Bleacher Report, the only conclusion I come to is just how low the bar is what they pass off as content. I swear, I could pick any poster on this sub at random to do the same job. Hell, they'd probably do a better job with their analysis because they had about 10 paragraphs of circles. ""The Lakers need a ballhandler not named Lebron James."" That's literally the whole fucking article in 9 words.  These guys make hundreds of thousands of dollars for this shit. I need to find a way to get a job with B/R. Low effort content, low effort work, high paying job. Someone sign me up for that shit ASAP"
"Agreed. People here keep saying the prime is around 30. It might be for some of the greats, but not average. It reminds me of the NFL, where people say Quarterbacks reach their prime in their early thirties because a few high profile players like Brady and Brees did.  [Analysis says it's usually around 26-27 in the NBA.](https://hoopshype.com/2018/12/31/nba-aging-curve-father-time-prime-lebron-james-decline/) All-NBA selection drop off hard around 29-30. Big men and those with injury histories are even worse statistically. I hope Embiid plays at his peak level for a long time, it's a more fun league with him. But history would suggest that the Sixers window with him is right now, and banking on him being at this level in five years is very risky. Add in the fact that Joel has very known issues with conditioning and such...it starts to look rough.  Deandre Jordan dropped off around 28.  Dwight dropped off around 28.  Pau Gasol started declining around 30.  Boogie fell apart at 27.  Not everybody is Lebron or Tim Duncan. The history of big men in the NBA says it will happen sooner rather than later. With a guy with as many red flags as Embiid has, you don't count on the future."
Pat Riley said it best :    Michael Jordan is the greatest ever  LeBron James is the best ever
"*“I went to J-Kidd [for] Game 2 and said I want that assignment,” Pierce said of defending LeBron James, according to ESPN’s Ohm Youngmisuk. “I think I’ve guarded him more than anybody in this gym. I know his tendencies a little bit more and I just try to step up in that role and try to lead that way.”*  So it would have been better if he said nothing? I'm not even a huge PP fan but he thought that defending LeBron would give the team our best chance to win. I don't see a problem. It makes sense, he had more experience defending Bron than anybody at that point. And if you read the article, you can see that he did have success guarding LeBron.  *""In Game 2, Pierce guarded James on 42 percent of his plays and limited him to eight points in that second Heat win. The average distance of James’ field-goal attempts with Pierce on him was 18.6 feet compared to 9.6 against all other Nets defenders. James attempted one drive on Pierce during that win, according to ESPN Stats and Information.""*"
No. Lebron James is killing the NBA. Which is already dead btw.
So if he’s not better than the player that was touted as the second coming of LeBron James he deserves to be ridiculed and called a bust?
"Yes because as we've seen from you guys time and time again, regular season is all that matters. Especially when the other team has scrubs like lebron james."

"Lebron James.

"There’s a bit of side to side movement involved in it, although I guess it’s more path navigation and footwork as you said.  Anyway; my point is still: Spence is QUICK. Like he’s as fast as present day Westbrook but he’s an actual threat to the 3 point line. Once he blows by you you probably aren’t getting that shot unless you’re Lebron James."
The face of a man who realizes his 2nd MVP award might be rigged for Lebron James.
Giannis suddenly fearing his 2nd MVP will go to Lebron James.
Aaron Gordon does that drone thing combined with the over the mascot behind the legs dunk for 40 points.   Bronny James combines all the dunks he did in high school for one ultimate basic dunk for 50.  LeBron is supreme overlord judge in this one.
Great move. Kobe always take the All Star games seriously and played with lots of intensity. He always tries his best to shut down LeBron James

"Lebron James, baby"
That is exactly the point you naive commenter. They are in a position to not have fear of being “disappeared.” They could instead use their fame to display the oppression China is projecting. How does China get away with kidnapping Lebron James? They couldn’t without showing exactly how garbage they are.   What a joke that you would say that people standing up for what is right is an easy choice to make for people behind a screen. The fact of the matter is that all people behind a screen or not should support the sentiment that Chinese oppression has no place beyond its borders. Any other sentiment is being a useful idiot for the CCP. Call people neckbeards. That’s a lame comment from a infantile mind. I call you a pussy who doesn’t think that the people who’ve achieved the “American Dream” should stand up for what that means.
LeBron James
"To clear things 100% up: Goaltending/Offensive Interference can only occur during a shot attempt. Might seem obvious but the other guy didn't state it explicitly. So if someone shoots a 3 the defending player can block the shot as long as the ball is ascending (imagine the flying curve of a jumpshot). Once the ball starts to descend/drop you're not allowed to interfere with it as long as the ball is above the rim.   They made the rule that way since otherwise every player standing near the basket could ""block"" the 3 point shot shortly before it would fall through the net for example. To prevent this type of cheesing the NBA invented the interference rules. Once the ball hits the backboard you can't block it anymore as well. I'm not sure if this is stated as an extra rule since technically the Ball starts to descend as soon as it hits the backboard, so it goes hand in hand with the original definition as well.  LeBron James' famous block on Iguodala is such a legendary moment because LeBron managed to block the shot literally a moment before it would have hit the backboard. He was really close to committing a goaltend there but managed to make a legendary defensive play. Had Igudoala's layup hit the backboard before LBJ came flying the basket would have counted."
lebron james?  ben simmons?
how do yall honestly feel about lebron james?
I think you might be jumping the gun on calling Jeanie Buss a good owner. Lebron James is the reason we are not still a dumpster fire right now.
"damn I read this in Lebron James voice, what a night  I remember being at the edge of my bed watching, relieved that it was finally about to be over after many nights of sleepless nights refreshing the Miami Heat boards and twitter waiting for any leaked “inside source”  Okay that’s an end to my rambling"
ESPN: Anthony Davis says Lebron James is not the answer for the Lakers to be feared.
Tracy Mcgrady and Tristan Thompson are both ambidextrous. LeBron James as well.
Terrence Williams aka the second coming of LeBron James.
"PG- Handles the ball the most, is usually the best passer, usually the shortest player, usually a good shooter  Center- get rebounds offensive and defensive. A player that stays in the paint usually and gets most of his points from finishing inside. Main utilities are playing defense and scoring inside.   An offensive rebound occurs when your teammate misses a shot and you rebound to obtain possesion again after the miss  An example:  Kyle Lowry misses the 3 pointer, Serge Ibaka gets the rebound off the missed three pointer and is credited with an offensive rebound  Defensive Rebound- a rebound that occurs after the other team misses  Example:   Lebron James misses a 3 point shot. Kawhi Leonard gets a rebound off the miss. He is credited with a defensive rebound.   Field Goal just measures how many shots you made compared to the shots you missed excluding free throws. It tells you a general sense of how efficient a player shot. For example, it's better to shoot 10-10 from the field than to shoot 4-10 because you were more efficient.  Above 50 is super good, like amazing  Usually, 50 percent FG shows an ELITE player, like MVP     45 percent is good, probably all star   43 percent is like average   40 percent and below is pretty bad usually  A lottery pick is just draft pick selected 1-14 within draft  EDIT: if you have any more questions pls ask"
"Ummm by have AD, Kawhi, Luka, Jokic, Westbrook and Harden. And oh LeBron James"
"Offensive rebound is any time any player from the offense gets a rebound from a missed shot by their own team. For example team A point guard misses but the rebound is gathered by any player from team A. That is an offensive rebound. A defensive rebound is when team A shoots and misses and any player from team B gets the rebound.  Field goals are used for total shooting percentage. Any shot that isn’t a free throw  is considered a field goal. This way you can determine a players shooting percentage in total. The 3 point percentage is a players shooting percentage from only 3 pointers. So essentially you’re looking at how a player shoots from anywhere on the floor either dunk, layup, jump shot, or 3 pointer vs solely 3 pointers.  The game is moving to a more positionless game but you’re correct. In classic terms the point is the passer and offensive captain. He tends to initiate and call plays. Shooting guard or 2 guard is traditionally your best shooter. This is a guy like Kyle Korver or Klay Thompson who can run around and just make any shot if you leave them open. Small forward or the 3 are your combination of a guard and a big. This is your Lebron James or Kevin Durant. They can defend multiple positions and are generally good shooters and also excellent at getting to the rim on offense. Power forwards which are also known as the 4. These guys are like center-lites traditionally. They have a good mid range jump shot and are good rebounders. They are traditionally big men who help stretch the floor. Centers are usually the biggest guy on the floor. They are also called the 5 position. These guys usually play down low in the post and protect the rim from the opposing teams layups and/or dunks. The center has become a pretty versatile position and now includes players who are able to shoot the 3 ball and play down low.  You’re correct about everything else. Not sure how Booker was selected but I’m sure there was a vote between coaches and fan vote and he was the next guy on the list."
"Offensive rebound is when a player gets the rebound while on the opponent's half. These are more rare and more impactful, because getting a rebound on your own half (defensive rebounds) is easier. There are usually more people on your own half and they make sure the opponent's won't get near the ball (boxing out).  The pointguard is usually the person who handles the ball and dictates what play they run. For example he will call the center to come near him and set a screen. A screen means the player will stand still and make sure nobody gets passed him. This way his teammate can run past him while blocking the opponent. Because the person who sets the screen also has a person defending him, this person will most likely start defending the person who asked the screen. All in all this process is created to get 1 person open or make sure the defenders are switched, so 1 person has a height adventage Vs his opponent.  Shooting guards en small forwards are 'wings'. They usually stand on the edges of the 3 point line and shoot 3's. The small forward is taller than the shooting guard and usually also goes to the basket during a play to get an easy layup or dunk (cutting)  The power forward en center are the biggest players. They will stand closer to the rim and battle for rebounds. During the modern NBA these also start standing around the 3point line. This creates a lot of space around the rim (spacing) which makes it easier for the person with the ball to run to the rim in a 1v1 scenario (driving).  Positions are getting outdated lately. People like LeBron James are small forwards but play as a point guard. When these taller players are also called small forwards. I'm saying these positions are outdated because people play different roles on offense and defence. LeBron James is the point guard on offence but defends the small or power forward on defence.  Field goals and field goal attempts let you know how much baskets and attempted baskets a player has made. This gives you a better idea of how good he shot the basket. Someone can have a 7/7 fg and 0/3 3pt making him 70% accurate from the field but 0% accurate from deep. These analytics are used so coaches know how efficient players are. A person can score 30 points a night, but if he needs to attempt 50 shots for it, he's not doing it very well and should probably shoot less.  Exhibition games are games where players don't get salary (not sure though). The revenue created from these games goes to charity. Most famous exhibition games are the all Star games.  Booker is indeed an all star now, Dame is aswell. When players get injured they get replaced by the person on the same position with the most votes."

"It doesn’t though. You can mislead others by stating a 100% true fact but leaving out a key piece of information which leads to an incorrect conclusion. Example: LeBron James has lots of hair on his head. That’s a true statement, but it’s misleading because it leaves out the part where it isn’t his own natural hair that grew from his scalp."

Lebron James ✅      6 in a row ✅      Naw he jus lucky
"LeBron ""the fuck is per 36?"" James"
"I think you can just use basketball-reference for this.   Season finder → combined seasons (first to last) → put a minutes limit on it  http://bkref.com/tiny/UJRTC  I went with per 10 minutes just because they don't show more than the tenths digit, you can just divide by 10. Or to fine-tune it more and break the ties you could go per 36 of per 48 minutes.  Looks like with a minimum of 5,000 minutes played, we have:  1. **Michael Jordan** (0.787 points per minute) 2. **Joel Embiid** (0.782 points per minute) 3. **George Gervin** (0.780 points per minute) 4. **Kevin Durant** (0.733 points per minute) 5. **James Harden** (0.730 points per minute) 6. **Freeman Williams** (0.717 points per minute) 7. **LeBron James** (0.704 points per minute) 8. **John Drew** (0.701 points per minute) 9. **Dominique Wilkins** (0.700 points per minute) 10. **Anthony Davis** (0.694 points per minute) 11. **Kobe Bryant** (0.692 points per minute) 12. **David Thompson** (0.691 points per minute) 13. **Jerry West** (0.689 points per minute) 14. **Elgin Baylor** (0.684 points per minute) 15. **Stephen Curry** (0.684 points per minute) 16. **Shaquille O'Neal** (0.682 points per minute) 17. **Bob Pettit** (0.680 points per minute) 18. **Adrian Dantley** (0.679 points per minute) 19. **Walter Davis** (0.676 points per minute) 20. **Alex English** (0.673 points per minute)  Never heard of [Freeman Williams](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willifr01.html) before, crazy he's so far up there. Looks like he came in the league, scored a lot of buckets for two seasons mainly, then trailed off and just barely passed the minutes restriction I put on here."
"&gt;Are you really unaware of who are going to be free agents in 2021? Giannis, Kawhi, Paul George, Victor Oladipo (and that's just for starters).  Are you really unaware of everything else that came after that? Don't splice up my statement and ignore context. Like I said, I don't see them getting any of those dudes.  &gt; Those are really the only guys in the league you'd want over Zach Lavine? Man, you've got a pretty warped view of how good Lavine is if that's the case.   Those are the only guys that would perfectly fit the team and are definitely a few steps above Lavine. That doesn't mean Lavine is a top 10 player in the NBA, again, use context. The Lakers need someone who can shoot and preferably one that can create their own shot. Lavine is great at both of those things and be their go-to guy in the clutch for LeBron to play off like Dwade and Kyrie.  &gt; In 2021, as it stands right now, the Lakers most likely will have a maxed Anthony Davis, they'll have LeBron James, they'll have very small cap holds on both Kyle Kuzma and Alex Caruso, and they'll have a full max slot to pitch free agents with. This is the Lakers we're talking about, arguably the most attractive free agent destination in the whole league. Why exactly do you feel like they have no shot at free agents?   Because all of the top guys are on contenders and I don't see them suddenly leaving since none of them have teams where the makeup of the team is poor like KD to GSW."
Russell Westbrook undercutting Lebron James on a dunk
"I know this isn’t about Lebron really and is more about Lavine, but Lebron James getting the reputation as the guy who passes the ball ahead super far is so funny. There are guys who do Lebron’s long pass shit every game."
"Darko was 04 draft class and went #1, lebron james was a number 1 pick."
"They have produced only 5 other pro basketball players not named LeBron James, only which 2 have actually played in the NBA and neither were standouts. Jerome Lane was the only one in this quintet that was drafted  * Jerome Lane (graduated in 1985, played 5 years in the NBA) * Romeo Travis (team mate of LeBron, played mostly in Europe) * Dru Joyce (team mate of LeBron, played mostly in Europe) * JaKarr Sampson (currently with the Pacers, assigned to G-League) * Jalen Hudson (with the Wizards G-League team)  Their football team was decent but didn't really produce that many NFL talent either, SVSM aren't some athletic powerhouse like Oak Hill Academy. Their basketball team only really started racking up titles after LeBron James showed up"
"It’s not about the location. People aren’t comparing that. They’re comparing the historically shitty management decisions etc.   The Bulls are a dog shit franchise who’ve done nothing. Like, beside having Michael Jordan, they have been really underwhelming. Much like Cleveland with LeBron James.   Jordan got the Bulls 6 titles. Before and after. They have nothing to show for it. Like. Literally nothing beside a D Rose MVP.   The Thunder for an easy example in 10 years of existence, are a better franchise than the Bulls and Cavs in their entire histories have been without Jordan and Lebron....."
"Man that 2009 Lakers team were so dominate. I remember Christmas day when they played the Celtics who had an insane record of 27-2 and were riding on a 19 game winning streak. I still remember the hustle play by Kobe and Ariza that led to the Machine's and 1 [https://youtu.be/agMiOY4nUGY?t=42](https://youtu.be/agMiOY4nUGY?t=42) the entire game had an nba finals atmosphere to it. That Celtics team had a 3-2 lead against the Magic in the ECSF without Garnett.   The most impressive part of that season is when the Lakers went undefeated on their grammy's road trip and I pretty much was certain that there was no way they wouldn't win the title that season. Andrew Bynum had gotten injured during the 2nd game of that road trip when Kobe fell and slammed right into Bynum's knee if I remember correctly. This all led to Kobe dropping 61 at MSG. They eventually followed that up by beating the Celtics in Boston for the first time in their big 3 era, who were also riding an 11 game win streak at the time. ( I highly recommended watching this game)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ66zZtco8I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ66zZtco8I) and finally to end off their 6th straight road game they came into Cleveland who had an impressive 23-0 home record. Kobe played this game with flu like symptoms and Lamar Odom came up HUGE in this game ending the night with 28/17 and no one could ever forget this fadeaway by Kobe over Lebron with such a high arch  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUc8677iffE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUc8677iffE)   The playoffs came around and the Utah Jazz again for the second straight season get eliminated by the Lakers in 5. They never did have an answer for the Lakers length.  The Rockets win game 1 in LA but with the cost of Yao Ming being out for the entire series. I don't know if the Lakers didn't take the Rockets serious after that injury to Yao but I remember Aaron Brookes and Luis Scola lighting up the Lakers in games 4 and 6. The series ended with the Lakers winning in 7 but you could only think how well this Rockets team would've done with a healthy T-Mac and Yao.  The WCF was probably by far the toughest series for the Lakers that postseason as the Nuggets had an answer for the Lakers length in the front court. (Nene, Martin, Birdman) This series was a lot closer than a lot of people talk about. The Lakers won game 1 by 2 points and Ariza sealed the game by stealing the inbounds pass to Billups [https://youtu.be/d2D3krXZ3Dk?t=6200](https://youtu.be/d2D3krXZ3Dk?t=6200) and not only did he do that in game 1 but he also stole the botched inbound pass in game 3 to also seal the game[https://youtu.be/CaBR8uMR\_ic?t=7325](https://youtu.be/CaBR8uMR_ic?t=7325) also no one could forget the Mamba face during game 3  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35qSSlWpfFY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35qSSlWpfFY)  just an amazing series.  Even though the nba finals ended 4-1 this series could've easily been 2-2 with game 5 being in Orlando. rookie Courtney Lee misses an easy layup at the buzzer that could've tied it 1-1 [https://youtu.be/ZKshgJwb\_ac?t=20](https://youtu.be/ZKshgJwb_ac?t=20) The Magic had a double digit lead going into the half of game 4 until the Lakers came up with a huge 3rd quarter and clutch shots by Derek Fisher to send the game into overtime and to seal the game into overtime.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm9l1T\_0Mt8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm9l1T_0Mt8)   Also the Lakers ended the regular season 65-17. Lebron James led his team to a 66-16 in the East that season with a monster series against the Magic in the playoffs."
waiting for the zach lavine/lebron james/javale mcgee big 3.
LeBron James
"&gt;The point is to show Lebron can and did score on Morris over and over.  Except he didn't.  You had these illusions of scoring dominance against a helpless Morris relying on double teams. Instead, we saw a maximum TS% of 35% in ISO matchups (again, assuming he made all his FTs).   &gt;The closest is Iggy because of his foot speed and great hands and size. Definitely not Marcus Morris.  I never said Morris was the best Lebron defender. You're just straw-manning here. I said Morris was one of the few capable Lebron defenders.  Iggy is absolutely also in that category. It's also why LAC was rumoured to be looking into a trade for Iggy as well earlier in the season.   &gt;Trying to get Morris switched off isn't evidence that Lebron can't score on Morris. It's just smart basketball and easier to punish Rozier if he's on the court. Lebron, Kawhi, Harden they all seek mismatches to punish teams for using switch defenses. Going straight at your defender is Westbrook tier.  +  &gt; He ALWAYS plays like that. It's like you've never watched Lebron play Kawhi fanatics do the same thing. Oh he got a screen instead of just running straight at Kawhi!  And this is where your argument becomes so circular you end up accidentally agreeing with my original premise.  Here's what I said 17 hours ago:  *It's not about putting anyone on Lebron. It's about taking away Lebron's ability to force mismatches to find easy buckets.*  *Let's say Kawhi guards Lebron as he brings the ball up the court. What's the first thing Lebron does?*   *He calls for a screen and forces a switch and then bullies the mismatch.*  *A lot of Lebron's playoff offence is geared towards complex screening/switching schemes that put Lebron in favourable situations.*    You really have lost track of this argument haven't you?   * I originally said the value of LAC picking up Morris was that you wanted to have as many capable Lebron defenders on the court as possible to mitigate his ability to switch onto favourable matchups. I also say the ECF series really came down to whether Boston could keep Morris on Lebron.  * You say Morris wasn't a capable Lebron defender and used a bunch janky stats and fairy tails about double teams  * I point out that Morris actually did pretty well in regards to guarding Lebron 1v1   * You say, it doesn't matter because Lebron's game is actually built around forcing switches and taking favourable matchups.  Yeah, no shit sherlock...  &gt;So by my count, 11 points were generated off Lebron assists that were the fault of Morris's defense in Game 2.  Your count is wrong because you're poorly attributing these plays to Morris in a desperation to win an argument you've clearly lost sight of...   Let's race through them:  &gt;Horford loses Love because he is looking at the James/Morris matchup and preparing to help. If he really trusted Morris to contain Lebron maybe he wouldn't get backdoored by the slow footed Love?  You can't blame Morris for other guys making poor reads. It's not his job to think for them.  &gt;Morris also gives up a bounce pass right to the rim.   You can't blame Morris for other guys losing their men. It's not his job to stop that pass. You guard passes at the receiver not the playmaker.    &gt;Morris isn't the in the play because Lebron ran past him and left him in the dust. Morris and James started at the same position, Lebron ran past him, forcing Tatum to pick up James, leaving Green open. Whose fault is that? MORRIS again.  All you've done is show you know nothing about basketball here.  Transition defence is built around stopping the transition offence first and foremost. **Then** you worry about half-court defence and mismatches and all that other stuff.  * When it comes to transition defence, it's not your job to guard your man, it's your job to guard the man you're in front of, whoever that is.   * You also typically have one or two designated defenders who will start moving back to get a head start defensively before the offensive play has even ended.   If you watch the clip, you'll see that Horford and Smart are intentionally hanging back. Those are the two guys who are supposed to stop the initial transition play.   You can see Smart signal to Horford that he should cover Green because Smart is in a position to stop Lebron's transition drive, Horford misreads the play and reacts too late, leaving Green open at the rim.   You're not supposed to try and guard guys from the side. That's why when it comes to transition defence; it's not about who you start next to, it's about who you start in front of.  Morris starts in front of Korver and Love, it's his job to stop the kick-out pass to Love/Korver on the perimeter.    ***  Basketball is 5-on-5 not 1-on-5. You don't seem to understand that concept at all."
We have a dominant big man.   We also have a Lebron James.
"&gt;Congratulations, you found a highlight real of the entire 7 game series. You'll notice your videos don't include any misses and are a pretty ineffective way of judging matchups because they are by nature one-sided.  The point is to show Lebron can and did score on Morris over and over.  &gt;Horford loses Love - Not Morris' fault  Horford loses Love because he is looking at the James/Morris matchup and preparing to help. If he really trusted Morris to contain Lebron maybe he wouldn't get backdoored by the slow footed Love?  &gt;Morris isn't directly involved in the play - Not Morris' fault  So he gets beat down the floor by Kevin Love, fouls him and gives Love an and1, and it's not his fault? Yes it is. If your counter is Lebron is his main assignment, maybe he should be guarding Lebron and not letting throw baseball passes in a basketball game?  &gt;Bounce pass as Morris tries to save Monroe from the mismatch  Morris goes under the screen and still gets beat giving up the switch. Lebron then has 2 defenders on him leaving Thompson open for the bounce pass. Morris's defense was not good here he died on the screen hanging on to Tristan Thompson at the 3 point line.  &gt;Baynes loses Love on the screen - Not Morris' fault  Morris also gives up a bounce pass right to the rim.  &gt;Morris isn't directly in the play - Not Morris' fault  Morris isn't the in the play because Lebron ran past him and left him in the dust. Morris and James started at the same position, Lebron ran past him, forcing Tatum to pick up James, leaving Green open. Whose fault is that? MORRIS again.  So by my count, 11 points were generated off Lebron assists that were the fault of Morris's defense.  &gt;You'll also notice some of the highlights above have little asterisks next to them.  &gt;Two asterisks indicate the video clearly shows Lebron trying to switch off Morris &gt;One asterisk indicates Lebron has most likely forced the switch off Morris but it's not included in the clip  Trying to get Morris switched off isn't evidence that Lebron can't score on Morris. It's just smart basketball and easier to punish Rozier if he's on the court. Lebron, Kawhi, Harden they all seek mismatches to punish teams for using switch defenses. Going straight at your defender is Westbrook tier.  &gt;You see, Lebron didn't really dominate Morris at all.  &gt;He also spent a lot of the game passing out of the Morris matchup  And despite playing like that, James still scored 40 points on Morris in that series. He ALWAYS plays like that. It's like you've never watched Lebron play Kawhi fanatics do the same thing. Oh he got a screen instead of just running straight at Kawhi! Meanwhile he will still end up mounting buckets on every defender he ends up having anyways."

"&gt; Who could they get in 2021 that's better?  Are you really unaware of who are going to be free agents in 2021? Giannis, Kawhi, Paul George, Victor Oladipo (and that's just for starters).   &gt; Kawhi, Curry, Klay, KD, Kyrie, Dame, and Harden are the only other dudes I'd want  Those are really the only guys in the league you'd want over Zach Lavine? Man, you've got a pretty warped view of how good Lavine is if that's the case.  &gt; I don't see them getting any of them.

This is the Lakers we're talking about, arguably the most attractive free agent destination in the whole league. Why exactly do you feel like they have no shot at free agents?"
I'll just respect the fact that he's no longer with us and move on from this conversation because it sounds like you're trying to make a backhanded argument that Kobe Bryant was a better basketball player than Lebron James. People that think that are biased af or just flat out stupid.   Lebron will finish 1st or 2nd in most points ever scored and top 5 in most assists ever in NBA history.  He's the best all-around basketball player that ever played the game (people that debate this have an impossible time picturing Lebron on those 90's Bulls teams and the 2000's Lakers teams - or they just don't like Lebron for whatever weirdo reason). He would've elevated those teams higher than Jordan and Kobe and he would've had the opportunity to play against way lower tier teams in the finals like Jordan and Kobe did... people seem to overlook that **very obvious** point.
Nothing is a pipe dream anymore when LeBron James decided to join our shitty ass team in 2018 lmao
"It does, but if you're building a team with him as your best player, you're fucked in terms of championship contention. All you have to do is look at LA's performance with one of their stars on the court in the absence of the other. They're great with just LeBron, but trash with just Davis. You can't build a contender centered around a big in Davis' mold because they don't have the play-making, off the dribble scoring ability, or shooting to lead an elite offense. James, Curry, Durant, Leonard, Antetokounmpo, and Harden are all better players with play-styles far more conducive to building a championship roster around. Davis is a second-tier star."
"i am a huge lifer westbrook stan  but i am not sure  comparing him to bron  in 2016-2017   james is less explosive and fast but a lot bigger  bron is an all time basketball brain while west is a really smart playmaker 80% of the time that makes dumb or subpar decisions the other 20  lebron the better defender clearly  west has a decent edge on rebounding relative to position  lebron is a 36?ish 3 point shooter vs 40%, neither would be left wide open tho so both would be primarily driving amd running plays and this is the only thungh that changes  i still take lebron   if the question is right now... i think he would be closer but still a tiny bit behind giannis in reg season but he could actually be #1"
You do know that there are Pro gamers that are leagues better than regular people just like NBA players are better than your average person. Same reason you watch LeBron James is the same reason some people enjoy watching pro gamers but just on a different scale.
I can play basketball but I’ll never be LeBron James
LeBron James = Celebrity   Can actually ball.
You have lebron James? 🤔
Lakers are thriving because they have a LeBron James-Anthony Davis duo.
LeBron West-James
[clutch gene is a myth.](https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/miamiheat/post/_/id/7477/lebron-james-and-myth-of-the-clutch-gene)
"“Bringing up the ball is your Lakers rotational depth guy, Lebron James”"
"Okay 18 ppg as a rookie against LeBron James isn't impressive I forgot I did that twice on my way to work. Should've scored 40 than maybe one day he could be MVP. /s  It's not about scoring all the points it's about scoring when the opportunity comes to you which he did plenty in that series. Obviously he won't have a high ppg, he wasn't the star of that team and that team was built with depth in mind"
"&gt;It counts all play types equally when it really shouldn't. Getting scored on in a 2-on-1 fastbreak shouldn't be considered the same as getting scored on in isolation.  Pathetic. As if to imply Lebron didn't face Morris in the halfcourt in a playoff setting. The vast majority of Lebron's points come in the halfcourt especially in the playoffs when teams do not allow transition.  &gt; He had 15 points on 30% shooting for the game. A huge chunk of those 29 points he generated on Morris came from him passing out of the play.  No, that was Game 1. In Game 2 Lebron had 42 points on 55% shooting.  &gt;A huge chunk of those 29 points he generated on Morris came from him passing out of the play.  That's my point though. Morris could not defend Lebron in isolation, the rest of the Celtics had to help, and that left the rest of the Cavs open.  There is only one player in this league who has ever negatively affected James as a defender and he was the other guy on the market: Andre Iguodala. Lots of hype for others guys and bs excuses like you just spewed, but every other defender including Kawhi and Morris and have been lit up by Lebron historically. Happy Valentine's Day I got you something: https://streamable.com/qvea4   Let me know who is getting beat on these plays. Here's some assists too: https://streamable.com/c2crd"
"lol dude look at you so butthurt   There are a bunch of Euroleague stars who never chose to play in the NBA first of all. So all the biggest stars aren't in America. Doncic for example wears no77 and wore no7 before he came to Dallas because of Vassilis Spanoulis who is a legend in European ball. Not in the NBA.   There are players in the basketball hall of fame that have never even played an NBA game all due to how great they were in Europe.    I guess the US didn't care about the Olympics in 2004 then? When they lost. (got beat by 3 different countries in that tournament) Also if the NBA is so superior then a roster of NBA stars in the World Cup even if they aren't superstar should at least get a 3rd or 4th spot or something right? If they are that superior then they shouldn't be needing their Superstars to win right? Even a roster full of the top of the elite in the NBA in 2008 or 2012 had a bunch of very tight games. The 2012 squad barely beat Lithuania and Spain.   &gt;You really think the nba players care about a preseason game in October vs European teams? They don’t. On the flip side, I’d bet it’s like the super bowl for the European teams getting to play teams from the far superior league that is the nba.  lol another lame excuse. The NBA teams care about as much as the Euroleague teams care. Kobe Bryant was the one instigating trash talk when the Lakers lost to Barcelona in 2010. So he looked like he cared more in that instance. The Euroleague teams care about winning their respective domestic leagues and Euroleague titles.   &gt;Sure some of our stars are Europeans but the vast majority of players in the nba are american. Our depth of talent is so much greater it’s not even close.  The vast majority of players in the NBA are american because the NBA is an american league. Foreign prospects don't get half the chances to get drafted compared to American ones. Luka Doncic was the biggest generational talent we've seen since Lebron James and he wasn't even drafted 1st because he wasn't playing freaking college ball. If European prospects were getting the same amount of hype American prospects did you'd be seen many more of them in the league. It's that simple."
It's also what people said about Lebron James who was a trash defender his rookie year and became the best defender in the league.
You ever wondered who that high school kid named LeBron James Jr. is?
"Says the guy who doesn't know why Lebron James is held to a different standard than Kawhi.  Also congrats on watching the games, but you've made it VERY clear to me you wouldn't know what or how to discuss what you just saw. You can't even figure out why Lebron is held to a different standard than Kawhi.  Me thinks you're a troll."
Also breaking news: LeBron James may worked harder than Tristan Thompson in the gym
"pretty sure basketball is a team sport. at least it was last time i checked, did they change that?   outside of once in a generation talents like lebron james, there is only so much a single player can do to carry their team. are you telling me bradley beal isnt a good player because the wizards aren't in playoff contention? devin booker? trae young? KAT?"
"I am still trying to figure out why and how Luke Walton has a job immediately after failing to get to the playoffs with Lebron James...yet Ty Lue, who Reddit/media fails to give any credit to for winning a ring and getting to 3 Finals because he had Lebron, can't.  Oh how I wonder why that is..."
Lebron James. He’s the point guard right?
Who would've though Lebron James and Anthony Davis would get the Lakers to the 1st seed?
"I think OP is a lakers fan just doing his due diligence. While it’s not indicative of Kawhi, LeBron James would have been eviscerated for a similar performance."
If you're LeBron fucking James you don't need hair
The media better rip Kawhi like they did LeBron James for the horrific 4Q and both OT performance.
yeah because it's Lebron James. He's world famous and has been in the public spotlight since he was 16 years old.
with the exception of Lebron James

Lmfao. Also fuck LeBron James
"That Cavs team was really really good defensively. People forget that. They were 1st in opponents ppg and 3rd in defensive rating for that year. Also, John Collins may be better than Mo Williams in a vacuum but to pair with that version of Lebron? Mo williams was a better option. Besides 18 ppg on 47/44/91 shooting was very good production from your second option at the time.   James definitely was the biggest reason for how good that team was but a bad team doesn't get you 66 wins no matter how good your best player was. The ""early"" Cavs teams sucked from 2003-2007 but from 2008-2010 that team was very good. Especially for the Eastern Conference."
"Yep - Joe Ingles, Joe Ingles, Joe ingles, and Lebron James."
"Chris Haynes did 5 years ago  https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2015/06/delonte_west_lebron_james_clev.html  &gt; It reached a boiling point; he lost it at the airport.  &gt; ""The bus pulled up to escort us to the plane and I just broke down crying. I felt like my career was over. I was [expletive] up. I was concerned that my nieces and nephews wouldn't look at me the same anymore. I let the team go ahead of me. I wasn't getting on.""  &gt; In his mind, his game was tailing off and he was carrying a huge weight he couldn't support. West wasn't sure what his next move would be. He just believed the team would be better off without him considering what he was dealing with.  &gt; Fortunately, he never made it out of that airport alone.  &gt; A few minutes went by and James peeked out the front door of the aircraft, looking around for somebody. He finally spotted West and went after him along with Randy Mims, a member of James' ""Four Horsemen.""  &gt; ""Man, LeBron and Randy just fellowshipped with me and then the next thing I knew, here comes [teammate] Lorenzen Wright before, rest in peace. He came out there and grabbed me, picked me up, bear hugging me. He hugged me for like five minutes. He literally had me up and they walked me up to the plane. Lorenzen read me Bible scriptures the whole plane ride. That team was a family and LeBron was a big reason why."""
"&gt; They do give a shit about defense but offensive strategy has changed to overwhelm even elite defense  It's not just strategy, it's also the rules. The NBA changed the rules to increase scoring - particularly guard scoring. After all, 3 of it's 5 most popular players ever were guards, and the other 2 were SFs. Guards sell tickets, big men don't. No one gave a shit about the NBA when it was Wilt, Russell, Kareem, or Mikan's league.   This   &gt; or any contact is a 3 point foul.  is a rule change, not a strategy change. NBA teams would gladly go all Bruce Bowen on shooters if they were allowed to, because it's effective. So is hammering the shit out of any guard who attacks the rim - it was even effective against Jordan, it would be even more effective against a smaller guy like Trae. Even Lebron complained about the physicality of the Wizards in his early years.   - 2008: [Wiz's Haywood says LeBron should stop complaining about rough play](https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3372615)  &gt; Following Cleveland's 100-97 win in Game 4 on Sunday, James, who has absorbed two flagrant fouls in this rough-and-tumble playoff series and has been banged around by the Wizards, was asked about Washington's tough-guy tactics.  &gt; ""I guess that's what they want to do,"" he said, ""hurt LeBron James in this series. It's not working.""  &gt; ... (Wizards C Brendan) Haywood, who was called for a flagrant-two foul and ejected from Game 2 after shoving James, believes it's time for Cleveland's superstar to stop complaining.  &gt; ""I mean, come on man, this is the playoffs,"" Haywood said following Monday's practice. ""He wears 23, he wants to be Michael Jordan, I can respect that, he's a great player. You saw what Mike went through. Mike got fouled way worse than this. No one is trying to hurt him, everybody is trying to play basketball, trying to play tough. Play basketball and leave it alone."""
Monte Morris and LeBron James epic duel
Lebron james.
"Zion is not Lebron James and no one is going to NO's. Zion much like most of these stars have very little impact on team wisn. They put up empty stats. This is why guys like Lebron, Giannis, Luka are special talents because it's beyond the stats. It's their ability to manage the game and set up teammates to win games. This is something Jimmy Butler is doing in Miami now and that's why they're so good. When Lebron is out of the game in LA even with AD in the game you can see how much worse that team is without him."
"Super low res, but [here they are](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-07/31/5/campaign_images/33d60dabfc34/watching-lebron-james-enthusiastically-celebrate--2-2484-1564549627-0_dblbig.jpg).

Mike Brown (lol):  * Steve Nash * Kobe Bryant * LeBron James * Pau Gasol * Shaq
"Chuck Daly coached the Dream Team, but if that doesn’t count, it’s Pat Riley and this doesn’t include anyone he played with like Wilt, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Gail Goodrich or anyone he acquired as an executive like LeBron:  PG: Magic, Gary Payton, Tim Hardaway Sr  SG: Wade, John Starks, Dan Majerle  SF: James Worthy  PF: Anthony Mason, Charles Oakley  C: Kareem, Shaq, Alonzo Mourning, Patrick Ewing  You could play so many different ways with this roster."
If you're a floor raiser you're likely a ceiling raiser too. I think having James Harden and Lebron on the same team would be more ideal than having Klay or Draymond

"&gt; First, Iguodala was drafted in '04, not '03. Vince carter was drafted in '98. A full 5 years before Lebron and Lebron still has more mileage.  thanks for making that clear(er).  couldn't really find any 'comps' from this era so i had to use them.  &gt; Of the 2003 draft class, only 3 players are still in the league. Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Kyle Korver. It's just absolutely crazy to think about how the second best player from that draft, a future hall of famer and all time great, Dwyane Wade is already retired...meanwhile Lebron is still playing as one of the top 3 best players in the entire world.  can't echo your point(s) here enough.  DWade had a very long and illustrious career to say the least - 16 seasons, 13 playoffs appearances, 3 rings, finals MVP, Olympic gold...i could go on.  i wanna add to your 'meanwhile' though...  &gt; Lebron is still playing as one of the top 3 best players in the entire world...  ...and is tied for a league leading 12 triple doubles with a dude that was 4 years old when LeBron made his NBA debut. :)    good post, dude.  peace."
He’s a black lebron James

"&gt;Finishing :LeBron James - Probably the best finisher of all time, he just runs through entire defenses and dunks and they can't do anything to stop it.  Cant really agree with this. LeBron's layups aren't really that great at all compared to several all time great guards."
"The Cavs joked about running him into the ground:  &gt; Cavs officials have privately joked that ""the tread is off his tires"" as James transitions to L.A. after playing so much last season.    https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25009990/luke-walton-los-angeles-lakers-taking-long-view-lebron-james-playing"

But if you go game by game West even at 1-9 has a higher winning percentage than James. That's because even though West was going up against the greatest dynasty in American sports history because he affected almost every game while LeBron just fills spreadsheets
"If LeBron James is selected #1, then 8 of the last 16 #1 picks will have either “Andre” or “Anthony” in their names * 2005: Andrew Bogut (contains ""Andre"") * 2006: Andrea Bargnani (contains ""Andre"") * 2011: Kyrie Andrew Irving (contains ""Andre"") * 2012: Anthony Davis (contains ""Anthony"") * 2013: Anthony Bennett (contains ""Anthony"") * 2014: Andrew Wiggins (contains ""Andre"") * 2015: Karl-Anthony Towns (contains ""Anthony"") * 2018: Deandre Ayton (contains ""Andre"") * 2020: LeBron James (contains “weird feet”)"

LeBron James.
TIL LeBron James is a Chinese concubine
"Honestly, I think Ellen herself could take the SG or SF spot on this list.   While small, she seems a little too stiff and rigid to be an on ball PG.  Especially nowadays that you need to have fluid movement.  Put her at the 2 and she has elite perimeter defense with her lanky arms, and great cheesy dance moves for after she hits a corner 3 at the end of the shot clock.  Put her at the 3 and she can do all the things mentioned above, plus can easily play in the post and back down opposing guards with her 'Mom Jean' Ass.  I'm not trying to take anything away from LeBron James here.  I'm just saying that we need to make sure we're looking at all of our options here."
"Maybe you can clone LeBron James with a 3D printer and those sweet toenails.  All jokes asides, congrats on the card game and marriage!"
There are literally hundreds of posts made about the comparisons between Michael Jordan &amp; LeBron James. Stop posting the same thing over and over again.
"&gt;Lebron James: Gaius Julius Caesar The king! Er, emperor. Julius Caesar led a long successful campaign against all odds to overcome Rome’s oldest enemy, the Gauls. Likewise, Lebron finally took down the Warriors in the 2016 finals. However, following their success, these two men decided to kick it back and enjoy their laurels in the big city (Rome, LA). Let’s hope Lebron’s rule goes better than Caesar’s.  Who is Lebron's Brutus? Kyrie? KD? Hopefully not AD...  EDIT: Excellent thread though. Westbrook at Attila is...apt.  EDIT II: Brutus was the friend/trusted companion who betrayed Caesar."

"Jordan was a better defensive player, a better rebounder for his size, and unstoppable scorer who ate souls at the end of James. Lebron is perhaps a better better passer, but if I have to win a game, I pick MJ 10 times out of 10.  (That's not a knock on LeBron. He is the ONLY guard or wing I put in the argument with MJ)."
Prime Dray almost won the warriors game 7 by himself vs Lebron James Imma go with money green on this one
"I mean, I think the answer to that is that most players LeBron's size don't have the ballhandling and passing skills to make as many passes as LeBron does. The whole thing about LeBron is that he has the skills to be a primary ballhandler and playmaker, with SF/PF size and strength.   If simply being taller made it easier to get assists, you wouldn't expect the league leaders in assists to be dominated by guards. But look at the leader going back to '86:   LeBron James	10.60	LAL  2018-19	NBA	Russell Westbrook	10.74	OKC  2017-18	NBA	Russell Westbrook	10.25	OKC  2016-17	NBA	James Harden	11.20	HOU  2015-16	NBA	Rajon Rondo	11.65	SAC  2014-15	NBA	Chris Paul	10.22	LAC  2013-14	NBA	Chris Paul	10.69	LAC  2012-13	NBA	Rajon Rondo	11.05	BOS  2011-12	NBA	Rajon Rondo	11.70	BOS  2010-11	NBA	Steve Nash\*	11.40	PHO  2009-10	NBA	Steve Nash\*	11.01	PHO  2008-09	NBA	Chris Paul	11.04	NOH  2007-08	NBA	Chris Paul	11.56	NOH  2006-07	NBA	Steve Nash\*	11.63	PHO  2005-06	NBA	Steve Nash\*	10.46	PHO  2004-05	NBA	Steve Nash\*	11.48	PHO  2003-04	NBA	Jason Kidd\*	9.22	NJN  2002-03	NBA	Jason Kidd\*	8.89	NJN  2001-02	NBA	Andre Miller	10.89	CLE  2000-01	NBA	Jason Kidd\*	9.78	PHO  1999-00	NBA	Jason Kidd\*	10.12	PHO  1998-99	NBA	Jason Kidd\*	10.78	PHO  1997-98	NBA	Rod Strickland	10.54	WAS  1996-97	NBA	Mark Jackson	11.40	TOT  1995-96	NBA	John Stockton\*	11.17	UTA  1994-95	NBA	John Stockton\*	12.33	UTA  1993-94	NBA	John Stockton\*	12.57	UTA  1992-93	NBA	John Stockton\*	12.04	UTA  1991-92	NBA	John Stockton\*	13.73	UTA  1990-91	NBA	John Stockton\*	14.20	UTA  1989-90	NBA	John Stockton\*	14.54	UTA  1988-89	NBA	John Stockton\*	13.63	UTA  1987-88	NBA	John Stockton\*	13.76	UTA  1986-87	NBA	Magic Johnson\*	12.21	LAL  &amp;#x200B;  LeBron is the tallest league leader in assists since Magic. Most of these guys are 6'3"" or shorter. Magic is really the only comparable playmaker at that size. But he was quite an outlier himself.   So, you could look at LeBron's height as being an advantage, but it is only an advantage if you still have the skills to run the point. Is it less impressive somehow because LeBron is so big? One could argue that it is more impressive- I could turn it around and say, of course John Stockton was so skilled at running plays, he had to be to make it as a 6'1"" guy. Would he have developed those skills if he were a 6'8"" guy who could dunk from the free throw line?  Go back and watch LeBron high school videos, he had an enormous size and athleticism advantage over his opponents. Unlike a 6'1"" guard, he could have neglected to learn basketball IQ and ballhandling and passing. He could have easily just been a run and dunk player and been fairly successful. How did he become a player who would lead the league in assists?  I just don't agree that it's not impressive somehow- If it were that simple, someone would have done it before. But there hasn't been a player similar to LeBron before."

No I’m talking about Lebron James.
He would be Lebron James.  And this is true for any human being on the planet.
"Long arms and legs: Kevin Durant. Legs for days. Personality: Steve Kerr. She'll be a cunning one. Soft hands: Steph Curry. Nice stroke. Face: Devin Booker. He's pretty. Hair: Kelly Olynyk.

How much better would I be if I suddenly was lebron James?
So like Lebron James
You’re going to wind up taking requests. Have fun photoshopping Paul Pierce shitting on James Harden shitting on a stripper shitting on Kawhi while hitting a fade-away over LeBron as Kobe smiles down from heaven and Elton Brand uses a $100 bill to light a blunt that’s rolled up in a copy of Al Horford’s contract as Rudy Gobert sits in a chair and caresses is Donovan Mitchell’s severed head Dr. No style
This could be the dumbest post I have read ... what if fucking tyron Lue has all the skills and power and height of lebron James... do u think he could have been a all star ?

"Kawhi has been sonning Lebron James since 2013, there is no rivalry."
"So you’re going to pretend that James Harden did not have a talented roster, like he had 0 help???? Are you ok? James harden team lives or dies with him because that’s how it was built!! Same with Lebron, same with Jordan, and even Dwade that ‘06 season.   Yeah he had Shaq, but can you name any other star talent on that team. But of course you’re gonna pretend that Shaq wasn’t also the same age as Chris Paul or that that year he only played 58 games.His team was as talented if not worse than James hardens, so that argument is dead   Next you say that Dwade never played a team like GSW,  true but that team is good for their offensive prowress not their defense, so the fact that James plays poorly against them is his own fault not because he played the warriors. Blowing a 15 point lead as well as a 3-2 lead is also inexcusable. And if they were able to go to 7 games against the warriors with KD without CP3 (even though they should’ve won that year if Harden just showed up), how were they not able to beat GSW WITHOUT kd and WITH CP3. So you weren’t 1 hammy away from a championship, it was more like a couple of good James harden performances from it."
"He's not the best player on his high school team which is the top ranked high school basketball team in California and top ten nationally.  LeBron James Junior is the most hyped player in the country as a freshman because he's comes off the bench and his father is one of the greatest basketball player of all time.  Sierra Canyon is a high school powerhouse in basketball.  BJ Boston, Ziarie Williams, and Terren Frank are seniors and are ranked in ESPN's Top 100 ranking but Boston and Williams are considered lottery picks in 2021 NBA Draft.    BJ Boston has committed to play college basketball for Kentucky while Ziarie Williams is still undecided with offers from Arizona, Duke, North Carolina, Oregon, Stanford, USC &amp; UCLA.  Terren Frank is ranked #80 on ESPN 2020 TOP 100 high school boys basketball players.  He committed to play ball at TCU in this fall.  Dwayne Wade's son Zaire is also a senior on the team but is only a 3 star recruit and not ranked in the ESPN TOP 100 but is ranked 23rd best player in California.  He's undecided with offers from DePaul, Nebraska, Rhode Island and Toledo.  There are no juniors on Sierra Canyon High School currently ranked on ESPN's 2021 TOP 60.  Only sophomore ranked on the team in ESPN's 2022 TOP 25 is Amari Bailey.  Bailey, a 6'4 guard, is ranked #5 nationally and is considered the best player in the state of California from his class.  He's undecided but has a scholarship offer from UCLA already.  ESPN does not rank freshmen high school players but coast2coast.com has LeBron James Jr. ranked as the 18th best player nationally for the class of 2023."
He’s probably the most known basketball player in The Netherlands other than Lebron James
"Again, you're agreeing with me.  These guys are the most elite (maybe the best athletes in the world), they get paid big bucks to do what you and I do for free. But they should get a pass for taking the season lightly? Its 82 games for the season, 15 wins for a championship. Did Ewing take the regular season lightly? How about Ric Smits, Gary Peyton, John Stockton, KJ, the Admiral, Tim Ducan, Clyde Drexler, Dennis Johnson, James Worthy, Pippen, Alex English, Alonzo Morning, Vlade Divac, Dominique, Detlef Schrimpf, anyone.  Kobe was the last of that type and Lebron the first of the AAUs.  I agree with LeBron putting up those numbers at age 43, but remember, he is one of the elite greats. He could play in any era, with any rules. The same can't be said for Curry ... or Dennis Rodman, or Kevin McHale."
Basketball is ruined because players are caring more about their careers from a long-term standpoint? Have you ever heard of LeBron James? The dude is gonna drop 27/7/7 on his 43rd birthday and you're upset that they don't *leave it all on the floor*.
"No matter how good he is, if his name wasn’t LeBron James Jr., no one would be paying attention."
He’s Lebron James’ son   He will get a shot with a team because of that
"Depends on how he develops as a player, hes not his dad but then again his dads fucking lebron james"
"&gt; You’re totally missing the point.  I'm absolutely not. There is no point to be made for Harden vs. Wade which would favor James. Maybe when Harden's career is over and he's had some playoff performances when he puts his team on his back then there's an argument. It doesn't even need to be rings but so far it's been chokejobs since his finals with OKC to his exits vs GSW, POR and SAS.  &gt; And now we act like the Celtics well outta their primes and all those other teams you just named had half the talent of those heat teams had  ??? Outside the big 3 most players were out of the league in less than a year since leaving Heat. James-Wade was top heavy but after Bosh they were really weak. This just shows how much you actually know about basketball but I'll continue this post just for the sake of it.  &gt; 06 Wade got calls  Another kindergarden level argument you can discuss with Wade haters, Mavs fans and the FBI team Cuban hired to investigate but not anybody who actually watched those finals.  &gt; IN MY OPINION when tally all the factors, harden is on pace to be better than Wade  Objectively wrong opinion, sorry.  &gt; You can sit here and manipulate any stat  Manipulate? SAS broke records for AST%, AST to TO ratio and open 3pt % two years in a row (records that still stand btw).  &gt; any reason Wade won shit after 06 was because a dude named lebron James  And any reason Wade didn't win in 2011 is Lebron choking. See how this works? Harden also has infinitely better team than Wade had at any point in his career before Lebron joined. And he still managed to win it all.  &gt; Give harden a lebron prime and I would think they would get rings.  Give Wade a PG like CP3 or Russ and he wins even more rings. Wade's issue in PO was that he never had a good PG and defenses could always collapse on him. But he fought through it, even through those Pistons teams who were the best defensive team at the time.  Also, Lebron had Kyrie (you know, the scoring guard who doesn't choke in the playoffs like Harden) and only won 1 ring. So no, Harden with Lebron doesn't win any more in my opinion.  &gt; if you think wades better that’s fine, but using rings as a reason isn’t doing your argument justice.  It's fine because it's objectively true. And even if they both don't win anything Wade's legacy is still superior. He has the best finals performance of all time. Superior playoff renome."
"&gt; So, which advanced stats aren't going for him now?  [On/off stats for him are very mediocre two years in a row now.](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4432/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) As well as net rating, he is like 4th or 5th on his team last time I checked. His team is barely improved when he plays this year (and was worse with him statistically last year). Lebron James, Giannis, vastly improve their team when they are on the court on both offense and defense and Luka has the on/off of a mediocre role player."

"You’re totally missing the point. I’m not arguing anything against wade at all. But it definitely counts for something that harden played the best team of all time.   And now we act like the Celtics well outta their primes and all those other teams you just named had half the talent of those heat teams had. Let’s get it straight- the heat were the first team to form a supersteam. 3 superstars all in the middle of their primes. and 06 Wade got calls(in the finals) that harden gets now BUT he only in the regular season...  no one thing points to the other being better but IN MY OPINION when tally all the factors, harden is on pace to be better than Wade.   You can sit here and manipulate any stat and give it any backing as to why it fits your narrative but to me when you tally every single thing, harden is better slightly.   Then you bring up stuff like spurs in 13 lol any reason Wade won shit after 06 was because a dude named lebron James.   Give harden a lebron prime and I would think they would get rings."
Steve Kerr and LeBron James
"Anybody know who Bruce Blitz is? If you don't, not a loss. Dude is a fucking moron. But if you do, I pity you. For those who don't know, he's pretty much your standard NBA fan above the age of 35. He does nothing but romanticize 90's basketball, worships Michael Jordan, and oh yeah, repeatedly trashes the modern NBA. But overall he just has a huge disdain, even hatred, for LeBron James. He'll trash this era calling it soft, spaced out, and heavily inflated by stats. If you're a player he has an established hatred for, good luck trying to get any credit from him. I heard this dude whine about people giving LeBron too much credit for the block on Iguodala and instead suggested people give J.R. Smith the credit for funneling him into the trap. He talks down on guys like Giannis and Zion who utilize their athleticism instead of their skills and has even said Giannis wasn't an MVP candidate and was as skilled as an average 12 year-old. He calls players soft and ""pussies"" for talking about their physical and metal problems and will just retreat to how tough the 90's era was. But the dude claims to not hate LeBron yet calls him lame nicknames such as LeBrick and LeBum, said he's the product of corporate America, and has even called him a Satanist because of his pre-game handshakes and hand signs. This guy is also a pussy who blocks people on Twitter if they disagree with him and looks like Elmer Fudd if they did a Looney Tunes live action film."
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this.""  it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass.  edit2: i just thought of something else, i've been pinning this on ""the government"" when there are plenty of private companies and organizations with the funding and technology to do something like this. i mean people this is 2015.....wouldn't you be more shocked if by this point someone HADN'T tried to create a super human by now? but you never thought that you might have been watching one this whole time."

""To do what Michael has done ... what he did was more charisma, there was more articulating and stuff like that. LeBron is more like ... there's no flash to his game. He's a great player, don't get me wrong, he's a hell of player, I'll give him that. But to me Scottie (Pippen) and Michael are probably the two best one-two punches I've ever seen.""  &gt;Rodman, who won three NBA titles with Jordan's Bulls from 1996-98, said a 28-year-old Jordan would average at least 40 points a game in today's NBA.  &gt;""I'm just sick and tired of people comparing (James) to Michael Jordan,"" Rodman said. ""It's a whole different era, man.""  &gt;Rodman said Jordan thrived despite playing in a more physical era in the NBA.  &gt;""LeBron came into the age of the game at a perfect time.

Just no clear cut all time great center, Ben Wallace is as close as you get."
"A part of being hard to score against is being dominant on offense. For instance, if you have elite defensive players but constantly turn the ball over, then the other team will still score a lot because of fastbreaks generated from turnovers.   So my all defensive team is actually equivalent to my overall team, and it just so happens to be my 5 favorite players anyways:  - Chris Paul - Jimmy Butler - LeBron James - Draymond Green - Joel Embiid"
"It all depends on if the players are in their prime, or at whatever highest level they played at while with Lebron/Ibaka  Is it young James Harden and old Ray Allen? Or do they each get their respective primes.  Assuming it’s the level they played at when with said teammate, I think it’s probably a tossup between Raptors Gasol and Vucevic, however I don’t remember how good Vuc was with Ibaka.  Also if it’s primes then Lebron’s team gets shaq"

"24 seconds and game-winning/tying shot combined is the norm when discussing clutch in this scenario. If you've evidence pointing otherwise I'm willing to listen.   Until then you're not gonna convince me the removal of game tying shots(to remove Lebron 1/6) and using 5/10 seconds of the normal 24 seconds in conjunction is not obvious cherrypicking.   Either way,just for shits and giggles to see if my theory is correct.   Last 5 seconds Game Winner   Lebron 7/15 (47%)   Jordan 5/11 (45%)   Last 5 Seconds  Game-winning/tying   Lebron 7/17 (41.1%)   Jordan 6/12 (50%)   Last 10 seconds Game Winners  Lebron James 8/17 (47%)  Michael Jordan  6/13 (46%)  Last 10 seconds Game Winners/Tying   Lebron James 9/22 (41%)  Michael Jordan  7/15 (47%)  Last 24 seconds Game Winners  Lebron James 9/22 (43%)  Michael Jordan  7/15 (47%)  Last 24 seconds Game Winners/Tying   Lebron James 10/27(37%)  Michael Jordan  9/18 (50%)  ====================  This shows Lebron is slightly 2% better than Jordan at making game-winners within 5/10 seconds..but the moment you added in Game tying shots Jordan regain the lead by around 6%-9%. Using the standard 24 seconds shows Jordan beating both in game-winners and overall by 4% and 13% respectively."

f you for ruining my dreams of having LeBron James as my dad   :(
"This pretty much nails it.  To put it another way, he was so incredibly hyped that I figured it was virtually impossible that he'd ever be able to match that hype, no matter how successful he ended up in the league. Somehow, he still exceeded expectations.   He was the first high school kid that sort of saturated ESPN coverage. Not only were some of his games nationally televised, but anything regarding him became news too, [like the time his mom bought him a Hummer](https://www.nytimes.com./2003/01/14/sports/basketball-lebron-james-s-suv-prompts-an-investigation.html)."
"not sure its written explicitly but it would fall under cap circumvention rules  which is why LeBron James isn't making an extra $100M a year being the spokesman for Rocket Mortgage, for instance  the new spouse would effectively become part owner, making them ineligible to play"
"Except he is the a ball handler on his teams. Ball handlers should develop passing skill or they won’t be the ball handler. Listen, that is why Lebron is recognized as a top all time player, nothing new you are saying, James Harden and KD are better at scoring than he is and Kawhi is better at defense. What sets him apart is the impact he makes on the game, his passing size strength athleticism scoring ability and IQ set him apart. To say if Chris Paul or Nash wouldn’t be in the league if they weren’t as good playmakers is total and complete bull crap. They are some of the top 10 shooters of their generation, some of the best finishers of their generation and some of the best defenders at their positions of their generation. They sure would be in the league."

"""LeBron James tested positive for Coronavirus...the Coronavirus has been quarantined for 14 days."""
"I think the game evolves all the time but I think that evolution is a bit more fluid than people generally wish it to be. I don't think the game evolves quickly enough to relegate players from two decades ago as being immediately inferior, for instance.   I've always been fascinated with how quickly and easily we could work our way back into time with a few degrees of separation. 35-year-old LeBron James is dominating today's game. He arrived in the league at a time when guys like Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan were dominating (and continued to dominate for some time). Kobe and Tim arrived when guys like MJ and Hakeem were dominating (both of who played until near 40 or beyond). Those two came up when Julius Erving and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar were dominating, so on and so forth.   We so often want to exclude and discount those who played the game in previous generations but I think it gets a little difficult at some point to discern where and when things reach that point of no return. Like, if Kobe could handle LeBron's era and MJ could handle Kobe's era and Julius could handle MJ's era, just how much trouble would Julius be in if he were to play during this modern era? Or would he excel?  I personally think the ABA-NBA merger is a huge flashpoint in NBA history. The ABA seemed to bring along a real change in the way the game of basketball was played, at least at the professional level, and I wonder if that change is what'd help thin the herd among players from those pre-merger generations."

Kareem, Walton, and Russell are all there for the same reasons: they were big, dominant, and won multiple titles in college.   LeBron because he is the most hyped athlete of my lifetime.   Pistol Pete because even though he didn’t go #1, it wasn’t due to his college numbers, but due to his size and the way teams drafted back then. With the 3 point shot being what it is now he would’ve gone number #1.  Oh and he averaged 44.2 pts a game in his college career without the 3 point line. He belongs on this list."
For sure. But he wasn’t a consensus #1 pick like a LeBron James was.
Michael Jordan  Lebron James  Kareem Abdul Jabbar  Magic Johnson  Shaquille O'Neal
"Kareem Abdul Jabbar  Wilt Chamberlain  Shaquille O'Neal  LeBron James  Bill Walton  Just looking at their college careers, general hype and skillset I think this combination of players would go top 5. For those unaware, Bill Walton led UCLA to 88 straight wins (their loss was a 71-70 defeat to Notre Dame, Walton played the game with a back brace and still had 24 points and 9 rebounds), Walton was a 3x College Player of the year (one of only 2 players to ever do so)."
LeBron James Jr
Do you think Zion can ever be as globally relevant as LeBron James? Remember that many people think LeBron is the third most well known athletes on Earth behind only Ronald and Messi (and all three men seems to think they are equal in popularity).
varejao had an underated peak in the lebron james interlude 11-14 years  not a star but a really useful role player that gave good defense and rebounding and did the little thinghs on offense
LeBron James first 9 yrs in Cleveland
"I’m glad you brought that up.  By every analytic and advanced measure, LeBrons primes is not quite as high as MJs.  Here’s some context for you, tho.   The first time Jordan played with another all-star it was Scottie Pippen. That season they took the Pistons 7 games, they didn’t win that game because Pippen had a migraine. Played 42 minutes scored 2 points. It’s the only reason he didnt knock out the Pistons the first time he had an all-star.   He never again didnt win the Finals in under 7 games.  You bring up the competition.  When Jordan came back for the second 3peat The Magic had gone to the Finals the previous year with Shaq and Penny and Grant. Jordan swept them, a 60 win team. Then in the Finals destroyed a 64 win Sonics team in 6 games to say nothing of the Stockton, Malone, Hornacek 62 win Jazz that he beat in 1998.  NONE OF THOSE SERIES WENT SEVEN  You ask how do you guard LeBron James, how do you guard Jordan?"
"I wouldn't mind getting dunked on by Lebron. It's not exactly humiliating, cause that's Lebron fucking James."

"  &gt; And jordans rings aren’t worth less when he was always on great teams playing worse competition in the finals? Of course not.  What? Lebron fans always say the 2016 ring means more than Jordan's rings because of the opponent, so why wouldn't that apply here?  &gt; All you can do is bring up the Mavs series.  It's the worst choke of all time lol. It has to be brought up.   And that's not ""all"" I can bring up, when I already pointed out that even when accounting for teammates and opponent strength (including the Warriors), Jordan still outperformed LeBron in terms of rings.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-should-lebrons-finals-record-hurt-his-legacy/  **Key part:** We can measure a player’s Finals record versus expectation by using FiveThirtyEight’s Elo ratings (which measure a team’s relative quality at any given moment) to calculate his teams’ pre-series odds of winning the Finals. Add up those probabilities over an entire career, and you get the number of titles we’d expect a player to have won, adjusted for who he played and how good his own team was.   If you add up the pre-series odds in the table above, you get an expected championship count of 2.8 for James — meaning he’s somehow running 0.2 titles above expectation, despite his record. That trails Jordan (who won 1.9 times more than we’d expect from the pre-series odds)"
Lebron James game 6 vs Celtics.
"Name me a series MJ wasn't the best player on the floor. Nope, not even the Magic series they lost in '95. Now think of an awful LeBron series. There's more than one, unfortunately. They were both 22 when swept by a superior team, only one looked like a god where the other looked, well, 22.   Then there's 2011 where even if the Heat win that series Wade is the Finals MVP, not James. And he was basically outplayed by Jason Terry. When it comes to being the GOAT, the actual GOAT, you can't be outplayed by a role player and not even the best player on your team."
"I was going to say the same thing. Bird was ridiculous in his prime.   From 84-88, (Bird’s age 27-31 seasons) Bird slashed 27.3/9.8/6.8 on .526/.400/.899 shooting.   Now, compare Larry Bird to LeBron James’ 26.8/7.3/6.8 on .579/.361/.743 shooting over the same age range."
LeBron James and MJ would never have a penguin named after them. Zion is already the goat.

"Are you certain about the Miami deal? From my memory, Melo wasn't a free agent during that off season. That's why he forced a trade to the Knicks in 2011. People argued saying that the should have waited for his free agency in 2012, meaning that was when his contract was up.  EDIT: this [article](https://heatnation.com/media/carmelo-anthony-explains-he-never-joined-lebron-james-dwyane-wade-miami-heat/) explains that it was a possibility, but it was something he needed to set up 3 years earlier during his contract extension. Not sure how he could have foreseen that.   The trade force IMO was blunder on the knicks part. Not Melo's. They didn't have to give up so much to trade for him. He eventually took a pay cut when he re-signed with the knicks later on.   Lastly, on the Lin thing. He was unhappy that Lin took such a big deal, since it probably meant that there's less money for better players. Which makes sense. Lin honestly wasn't going to make them a contender. Keeping Lin was more of a ""keep fans happy/make money"" move as opposed to a ""win a championship"" move.   I'll say it again though. Melo for sure wanted to win. It took him a while to accept a lesser role, not because he was selfish and wanted his own stats, but because he thought he was good enough."
"Hijacking top comment  **CONTEXT THAT NO ONE ACTUALLY KNOWS:**  What the reporter is referring to: in the press conference after the previous game, Tristan Thompson referred to LeBron as ""this great father"" not ""a great father"". He was joking about LeBron being old, and possibly referring to him being wise. It was an offhanded joke that for seem reason the reporter took seriously.  The reporter took Tristans comment completely out of context and created this cringey soundbite and possibly lead to the end of one of the funnest duos in the league.  Edit:  https://www.nba.com/cavaliers/postgame-matthew-dellavedova-lebron-james-tristan-thompson-may-14  At 7:00 minutes a reporter asks a question about it being Tristans fourth year and him being a young player. At the end of Tristans answer, he refers to LeBron as ""this great father"". It was such a small joke and some reporter somehow turned that into asking Kyrie what its like to be Lebrons son LMAO"
The fact that it was prime Miami LeBron James on a 3v1 against old man Terry is exactly why it's not impressive.

*LeBron James with the rejection!!*
https://youtu.be/V-QTiByTKaI  I never thought LeBron's dunk on Terry was all that impressive. 3-1 alley-oop against a very old Jason Terry. Plus he taunted after.   I remember Miami fans collectively jizzing their pants and bringing this up for YEARS after as the moment Jason Terry died.  3v1 LeBron James vs Jason Terry if you don't get a dunk then you're not doing your job. It's not like he dunked on prime KG/Duncan/Dwight.
Because LeBron is unique to LeBron James. There isn't any other player or person that comes to mind when you say LeBron. Same with Kobe and Shaq. There's a ton of dudes names Kevin though.

"&gt; unsmoothed salary cap spike  Which Lebron James himself was partially responsible for.  The Player's union passed a [unanimous](https://sports.yahoo.com/players-union-reps-unanimously-reject-nba-s--cap-smoothing--proposal-012414206.html?y20=1) vote to reject cap smoothing. At the time, CP3 was President, and Lebron was VP.  Both of those guys with big contracts coming up decided to get paid - which is perfectly fine - but they set up the scenario that would allow GSW to prevent either of them from winning a ring then."
"Wes Johnson getting crossed by Harden.  Varejao's signature play is getting dunked on by Wade and James Johnson's is LeBron blowing by him for a dunk.  Bargnani's either the time he hurt himself trying the most ridiculous poster dunk or when he shot the three with the Knicks up two and shot clock off.  You are getting pushback, but that was absolutely the single most memorable play of Splitter's career.  He wasn't really a highlight maker."

"&gt;I don’t think they go outta their way to get fouled it’s just their play style. James harden does it cuz he’s 3-15 from the field and wants points.   They do go out of their way to get fouled. Driving into a crowded paint is what giannis, harden, and LeBron do all the time because it's a smart move. And yes, I included harden because he leads the league in drives per game. He's insanely strong and deserves many of the fouls he gets."

I don't think Harden works as hard as Jimmy. I don't think any star works as hard as Jimmy (with the exception of LeBron but he's a god so he doesn't count).  Instead of attacking Jimmy in the first place you could have just agreed/added on my point of James working hard.
"horrible argument but i'm glad you tried  kyrie does not have the expectations to outperform lebron james in the nba finals. he wasn't disappointing, no, because nobody would've ever asked that of him. duh.  stephen curry *does* have the expectations to outperform klay thompson. people *would* ask of him to outperform kevin durant.  you're suggesting that the gap between kyrie irving and lebron james is comparable to the gap between stephen curry and kevin durant. kd &gt; curry, but the gap isn't *that* big dude..."
Some people say LeBron James and it’s not even close though.
"The most impressive part about LeBron's distance shooting is that he really doesn't have great mechanics, consistent rhythm or release angles, or balance. He just refuses to allow himself to miss because he's LeBron Motherfucking James.  The shots rarely ever look perfect as they go in, because they were never meant to be; they're just meant to go in the goddamn basket some way or another and that's what they fucking do."
I did a 360 windmill dunk on LeBron James in high school. True story.
My brother calls Lebron  “Old Game James” cuz he’s a lowkey hater.
"What the hell does the Heat's 30-11 run in 2017 have to do with the idea that LeBron James led teams tending to be terrible after he leaves? My point was that the Heat weren't terrible after he left like everyone tends to assume. They went 37-45 (1-2 wins from making the playoffs) with only 2 guys on the roster playing more than 62 games. Mediocre but far from terrible. Next season when mostly healthy they go 48-34, snag the 3rd seed, and forced a game 7 in the ECSF.  If anything, that 2017 41 win team you mentioned supports both mine and the OP's argument concerning the Heat. Miami found a way to bounce back after LeBron left and even managed to pick up and keep guys that kept the ship afloat when Wade left and Bosh retired. The team was too competently run to outright suck when a star left, even if that star was LeBron."
"You do realize that the Rockets went like 11-6 with Joey Dorsey starting at center back in 2014-15, right? He had been out of the league for three seasons at that point and was out of the league for good immediately after. That was years before James Harden evolved into the monster he is now.   I know Davis is on your favourite team but you don't have to deny obvious facts. A Davis-led offense and team will never make it past the second round and will never be a serious contender. He doesn't have the scoring or playmaking ability to do it. Go back and watch some Lakers games this season and pay attention whenever LeBron isn't on. A successful Anthony Davis team is almost totally dependent on having a good playmaker next to him. You aren't a superstar when your team's success relies so heavily on skills another player brings (coincidentally, skills Davis lacks)."

"In the 2019 playoffs, Damian Lillard faced more 1st team all NBA players in the West than Lebron James did in the East playoffs since 2011. The last 1st team All NBA player Lebron faced in the East playoffs was 22yr old Derrick Rose.  Who really had the easiest road?"
"Saw LeBron James coming out of a mexican restaurant once...around 2002 or so. Our eyes met while in the crosswalk, so I said, ""What up, Bron?""  He laughed, nodded his head and replied, ""怎麼了，伙計?"" and kept walking.  That was cool."
"Guards were stacked in the 90s, but forwards were also stacked in the 10's. Aside from early 2000's centers every position has been stacked. That's why All NBA honors are so highly regarded.   LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard and then guys like Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kevin Love etc... and still great past their prime Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol"
"When they hunt for a foul yes, agree. But like Lebron and giannis get to the rim so easily it’s pretty much 50/50 if it’s a foul or not honestly. I don’t think they go outta their way to get fouled it’s just their play style. James harden does it cuz he’s 3-15 from the field and wants points. Kinda different IMO but I see what you mean, they are just so strong already it’s not their fault defenders bounce off them after contact lol."
One valuable piece of scientific information I learned from observing this video is that Lebron James is an exceptional athlete and can jump very high. -reddit scientist
"&gt; For the definition of insanity, he could've asked for better players.  This is the team that traded away James Harden because they didn’t want to pay him.   &gt; Bron has always asked for playmakers.  And Bron left, too, because he never got what he needed to win. KD learned that lesson and went out and got his just like LeBron did when he bailed on Cleveland’s dumpster fire of a franchise to go somewhere he could actually win.   &gt; Not just poor people. Literally anyone who doesn't have their future set for life. KD was getting the max wherever he went.  What this should tell you is that money is not all that matters to players, and if it’s equal everywhere for Durant, then it’s not relevant. So once money isn’t relevant, you focus on other career goals, like winning. OKC never gave him a win, so he found it elsewhere.   &gt; The guy is generational. And generational dudes should do stuff the right way.  Generational dudes shouldn’t be held back from doing stuff at all by franchises that can’t help carry the load. The Thunder held back one of the best players ever, and personally I’m glad he got out from under it. He was being wasted in OKC, just like LeBron was in his first Cleveland run."
"My GOAT list based on team accomplishments, individual accolades, statistics and advanced statistics such as Per, win shares, VORP (also playoff performances and how the statistics rise).   1.

"Lebrons comment had nothing to do with “supporting” China or shutting up to earn a paycheck.  LeBron said his comments about morey (not China), due to the implications it would have on, not just LeBron, but every other member of the NBA organisation, this is the exact reason why Silver didn't speak out.  LeBron is a spokesperson for the league and he knows himself that this siin ok9tuation too unpredictable to comment on.   Also, you know what China are like, there were teams heading over for preseason games, LeBron has also got to take into consideration their safety, something with Morey did not do.  Just ask yourself, do you really think LeBron James supports China? Or are you just finding a reason to hate him?"

"*Game 1*  The prohibitive favorite in the Western Conference came into this round with all the momentum. Gryffindor, while still quite good, had been far below the scorching hot Slytherin serpents led by Kyrie and KD.   For game one at least, that trend did not continue. Kyrie, Harden, and Embiid all stuffed the stat sheet. **Kyrie** ended the game with 29points /3 rebounds/6 Assists/1 steal; Harden finished with 22/6/6/2 , and Embiid tallied  22/6/4/ and a block.   In the face of certain danger,LBJ reached into the sorting hat and pulled out a stat line of  43/8/11/2, **Dame Time Turner** flipped up a 29/1/8/1, Westbrook spun the narrative to the tune of 28/3/8/2. Rookie Zion Williamson also showed signs of life, tallying 15/4/5/2.   It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies. However, Kyrie may have learned a new lesson- it may take even more courage to stand up to your ex-teammates.    *GRYFFINDOR* wins 150-144   GRYFFINDOR LEADS 1-0   GAME 2  Slytherin was coming into this game after a tough loss to a team they thought less ~pure~ talented than them. How would they respond?  Harden must have returned from the strip club early to get shots up. *Harden* crossed the age line to enter a statline of 40/11/6 into the triwizard cup. *KD* slithered into a 26/3/3 statline, and *Embiid* was harder to contain than a blasted-ended skwert(sp?), dropping a hyper efficient 19/15/3 on 11 shots.  Gryffindor received a Grawp-ian effort from *LBJ* and a 30/5/9/1 statline and *Zion* drops a 21/5/4 with a block while Assistant coach Dumbledore mummers something about a prophecy under his breath. Despite this, Gryffindor is overwhelmed by the cunning of Slytherin.    *SLYTHERIN* wins 142-121   SERIES TIED 1-1   GAME 3 Slytherin hasn't been this excited since a basilisk roamed the plumbing of Hogwarts. Coming off an absolute blowout and perhaps the greatest sports season in Hogwarts history, Slytherin is posed to take control of the series and make the finals.  Harden earned his ticket to the next Slughorn party by piling in 30/4/5/1 on 14 attempts and 64% from 3. Embiid tallied 22/6/3/1 with 4 blocks while complaining about Crookshanks. Kyrie had a respectable 15 points on hyper efficiency.   Gryffindor responded. *Dame* had his defenders reaching for the skiving snackboxes as he dropped 24/233/8/1; *Westbrook* bludgeoned the defense for 23/6/6/1, and *Spida ""Son of Aragog"" Mitchell* had 5 steals to go along with 19/1/1. Gryffindor had FOUR more players in double digits as they prove that loyalty and friendship can help you win even in the face of the hardest roads.   *GRYFFINDOR*  wins 119-127  GRYFFINDOR LEADS 2-1  Game 4  Slytherin had lost to a far inferior team again. Would Harden, KD, Kyrie and Embiid show up for vengeance?    ...no.   These 4 stars had 17, 8, 5,7 points respectively.  Instead, it would be the young Slytherins to answer the call of the Dark Mark. *Porzingis* piled in 24/7/3, *Trae ""no I didn't soak my hair in polyjuice potion"" Young* added 22/5/8 to help Slytherin break into the room of requirement.   Gryffindor too would be lead by the year ones. While *LeBron ""Tiger King"" James* (whoops wrong reference) had a near triple double, *Donovan Mitchell* weaved a 27/4/1/1 and *Jayson Tatum* dropped 21/8/1/1 at only 11 years old.   While Gryffindor's new crop performed admirably, they didn't have enough to top Salazar's best efforts;   *SLYTHERIN* wins 119-114   SERIES TIED 2-2   GAME 5  With the series tied for the second time, would Gryffindor respond as they had in the past?   *Westbrook* Sectumsempra'd Slytherin's defensive scheme for 29/5/5/1. *Lillard* got special permission with the recommendation of McGonagall to drop 18/6/8. *Donovan* captured some acromantula venom and dropped 18/2/1.  Slytherin, on the other hand, had their stars feel the burn of the Dark Mark and return. *Embiid* dropped 23/7/4, *Kyrie* returned from the graveyard with a shiny new 22/5/3.  Slytherin had 5 other players pile in double digits to leave the house of Godric feeling hollow.  *SLYTHERIN* wins 114-110  SLYTHERIN LEADS SERIES 3-2  GAME 6  Gryffindor is now in trouble. But if there ever a house to stand brave in the face of danger and answer the call it’s them...right?  *LeBron* apperated a 33/9/5/4/1. *Westbrook* must have taken Felix Felicis (or at least been fooled into thinking so), as he dropped 22/10/10 for an impressive triple double. *Kyle Lowry* had a thicc 19/3/9, *Dame* provided 18/4/7, and *Zion* Expelliarmus!’d his way to 17/5/3  *KD*, not to be outdone, followed the voice in the pipes for a 28/3/6. *Kristaps* didn’t wilt in the face of the flames as he snared a 17/8. Despite their efforts (and the efforts of 6 other players in double digits), some last minute points at the end of year feast gave Gryffindor the edge.   *GRYFFINDOR* wins 138-149  GAME 7  THE BATTLE OF HOGWAR…(Okay not really, you still have the powerhouse Ravenclaw and the pretty great Hufflepuff left to, but still)  It all comes down to this- despite Slytherin being far more dominant in the regular season, Gryffindor has risen to the occasion. Despite being the least impressive of the house in the NBA, they have shone the brightest in the face of the most insurmountable odds.    Slytherin, never one to roll over, dropped 121 points on 52% shooting in the final game in the contest. Zach LaVine returned from the Forests of Romania and dropped 19/3. *James “my Jersey has been retired for years anyway” Harden* dropped 17/5/9/2. The rest of slytherin seemed to struggle some- *KD* couldn’t overcome the power of love and had 3 turnovers and 14 points. Embiid piled on three turnovers of his own. Kyrie “what does turnover mean to you” Irving contributed 4 turnovers and 11 points to the cause.   *Dame* seems more than willing to answer the challenge and drops an obscene 30/5/9. *LeBron* reaches into the Mirror of Erised and pulls out 26/3/8. *Ja “it’s Levi-O-SA” Morant* levitates to 16 points and an assist.  Gryffindor is able to destroy the last Horcrux.  *GRYFFINDOR* wins 132-121  GRYFFINDOR WINS ~~THE HOUSE CUP~~ WESTERN CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP 4-3."
"The 2012 Finals had LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden"
"The year is 2072. NBA regulation basketball courts are now the length of a medium sized airport runway. The 52 point line sits 1000 feet from the basket... Lebron James leades Cleveland to the finals, loses to the Mars City Aliens in 5."
Lebron James
Never forget LeBron James was afraid to post up JJ Barea
LeBron James.
07 cavs were swept whereas 11 dirk went over an even better lebron w/ wade et al  you shifted the goalpost to finals not chip but thats cool  I’m aware of 03 duncan and omitted it from my memory but will let the kids have their downvotes and fun  durant had russell westbrook serge ibaka james harden but lol cute not mentioning them  18 lebron was only solo in that effort once getting to the finals he had iterations of the squad throughout the playoffs
"He was 18 and 19, Jordan was chilling in college being 2nd option to James Worthy at that age   That is not even the point here, i am not comparing him to LeBron i have Jordan as the GOAT, it's just the double standards are a thing"
"James Harden, LeBron, Russell Westbrook"
"Kevin stared at the headline on the phone. He wasn’t surprised nor was he angry. He had known ever since Kyrie had requested a trade 11 months ago that he would be leaving. He had accepted this months ago.  This was why this season had been so special. He had made sure of it.  He was in the gym long before the season had started. He had worked on his midrange, post up and especially his 3 point shot. He was All Star Kevin again. He would fill the hole that Kyrie had left in the other man's heart.   Kevin didn’t entertain the idea that he would stay. Not after the trade deadline. Not when they blew away the Raptors and not after the conference finals. Despite the number of times they spent together, they never talked about it. He wasn’t going to stay, not even for Kevin.  So it was sadness that Kevin felt. An ache that had developed and grown as the season progressed. Every day spent with the other man made him happy but also meant that their time together was coming to an end.  In a way, Kevin was somewhat relieved that it had finally come to pass.  “LeBron James signs 4 year deal with the Los Angeles Lakers”  He searched for the correct chat window on his phone. His fingers hovered over the keys as he contemplated how he wanted to do this. For a moment he fantasized about pouring his heart and honesty into it. But what would that accomplish right now? Now was not the time to lose his head. He had been a professional on the court for 4 years; he could be so for 1 more text.  He kept it short and honest. The other man would understand.  “Thank you for the memories. I appreciate you and good luck”  Though, Kevin could not resist,  “I love you."
"Idk why there is any debate about this, three of these guys were best friends, Ray still lives in Miami and was like an adopted best friend after the Celtics abandoned him. Shane Battier works for the team iirc, and I'm sure him and Wade are probably still friends at least. James Jones might have the world's biggest hard on for LeBron. Not to mention guys like Juwan Howard, Haslem, Chalmers and probably even Birdman"
LeBron James is obviously Hufflepuff...the best house.
"Hard disagree. If someone was able to play only my 34 minutes a game, average 30, and lead a team to 73 wins it speaks more to the team than it does a player.   Nothing against Steph, but that team was so completely dominant from top to bottom that it’s hard to argue that it was the best season by a player ever. I’m not a Lebron James Stan, but what he did during his first stint in Cleveland right before leaving is literally the definition of most valuable"
"Yeah Lebron is bigger and stronger, just like OP said...  They are both amazing players, I do agree that Bird was more skilled (better shooter, dribbler, more post moves, better footwork) but if I had to choose I'd pick James because he's just a more complete player."
"According to [this article](https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/91407/kawhi-leonard-wreaking-havoc-on-lebron)  &gt;Only 17 percent of LeBron’s touches against Leonard in the Finals have resulted in a field goal attempt. That’s half the rate James has against all other defenders.   &gt;   &gt;James has been held without a touch on 35 percent of the Heat’s possessions when he’s guarded by Leonard. Against all other defenders he’s held without a touch 25 percent of the time.   &gt;   &gt;James has driven to the basket on 13 percent of his touches against Leonard. That rate jumps to 22 percent against all other defenders.  But anyway, I can't really criticize him for those Finals."
"Months fresh off his worst Finals loss against Dallas, LeBron met with legend Hakeem Olajuwon, possibly the best post player of all time, and worked on his footwork and moves in the post.   That following season, LeBron bounced back and won the MVP, Finals MVP and his first ring, plus the gold medal with Team USA.   During the Playoffs and the Finals, James attempted all-time highs attempts and makes inside the zone, and showcased his newly incorporated arsenal."

I always thought Andrew Wiggins was like an absolute superstar. Like LeBron James superstar. Didn’t learn until earlier this year that he wasn’t as good as I thought
"Well I've been watching the NBA since 1989, I even posted my early 90's NBA card collection here:   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f64oq/found_my_old_9095_nba_card_collection/  I understand what you are saying, and I know what 'sources' are. I also remember Woj when he was at Yahoo writing emotionally charged articles slandering Lebron James through 'sources' because he never had access to him. He's exceptional at breaking news, but rumours and speculation has never been his strong suit and he has bias.   I don't really care about the story or who is right. I was just amazed that news from the horses mouth is not believed over 'sources.'"
"in game 4 of the 2011 NBA Finals, the third best scorer on the Miami Heat team was LeBron James with 8 points, behind Dwyane Wade with 32 and Chris Bosh with 24"
"I completely understand people thinking it’s stupid, but I will forever be in the camp that LeBron should have won it.   There’s no rule that says it has to go to someone on the winning team. I think that someone in the winning team should get a HUGE boost, but I think even giving a huge boost to the Warriors, Iggy doesn’t deserve it over James.   Dude averaged 35/13/9. That is absolutely ridiculous. Lead both teams in every major category.   I don’t care that it’s never been done in history before. No one dominated a series like that in history before either outside of maybe MJ in 93. He deserved it and I’ll die on that hill."

I totally did.. I went into detail about lebron james and how much attention nba players get for literally anything? Even taking a shit? So ill ask one more time.. Anything to add or are we just gonna talk about my deleted comment that was posted in the wrong thread?
&gt;	Could you imagine if nba players... got married  LeBron James-Harden
"Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Tracy mcgrady. They didn't go to business school"
That's unbelievably stupid. You really think someone as competitive and team focused as LeBron James would intentionally lose a finals series. Cant tell if you're trolling
"LeBron ""Kendrick Perkins"" James"
"Oh god! A player leveraging his position within a dynasty team to get the best deal for himself!   Wait, is it Lebron James?  No.  Oh God, Oh Fuck break the glass we've got a player getting the best deal for himself without giving up money for the team.  Andre earned that contract and other teams can feel bad about paying it for us but he earned that with his past and large contributions to multiple championship runs at that point."
"&gt;From 02-10, Steve Nash's offensive teams were ranked #1 every single year in offensive rating. 9 straight years of #1 offenses  Incorrect. Try to fact check your statements before making them with fake confidence.  &gt;Nash was THE reason for the Suns having the best offense. You saying it's a gross exaggeration shows how much of an ignorant moron you are. Stick those stats up your pipe and smoke it.  I do not dispute that Nash was the anchor for those offenses. I do dispute that he was better than James offensively because of a result that he would not have duplicated on the Cavaliers. Put LeBron on the Suns and that offense is all time level as well and the team fairs better in a postseason environment due to his defensive versatility that would fit extremely well on that Suns team that sacrificed defensive personnel for offensive firepower.  &gt;&gt;From 02-10, Steve Nash's offensive teams were ranked #1 every single year in offensive rating. 9 straight years of #1 offenses  Incorrect.

If its clear as day then you should have no issue proving how Lebron's stats were inflated due to his competition in the conference. So do it.   &gt;He then surpassed Duncan defensively from 03 to 08 with 3 runner-up DPOY finishes.  Care to explain how you argued that Camby was better than Duncan in '07 because he beat him in traditional defensive stats while you also say here that Bowen surpassed Duncan while being inferior to him in traditional defensive stats. Why the double standard. Bowen got two points in the '01 DPOY voting. Allen Iverson had one point. LOL at you trying to equate that to what would happen in San Antonio where he suddenly appeared on the national radar as a DPOY level defender.  &gt;You really are lost. Iverson had the better season. Doubly so when you look at how Shaq regressed while Allen had a career year. The rest is fact.   Ah yes, a regressed Shaq that averaged 28/12 on 57 TS% while leading the association in PER and all sorts of metrics that you tried to use for Marcus fucking Camby to put him over Tim Duncan. A regressed Shaq is better than Allen Iverson could ever dream of being. A regressed Shaq was still the best player in the game. Not AI. AI in his career year is worse than Shaq in a ""regressed"" state."
"I became a fan of him off the court more than I did on the court at first. He was young and rich and famous but had intelligence and stayed out of trouble. He sets good examples to kids that look up to him. Sometimes he might say something people dont agree with but he learns from this mistakes. What he did for the city of Cleveland, fulfilling a promise the way he did, spoke volumes about him. The way he carried the pressure of an entire city on his back and didn't blink was amazing. And he was starting to do it for LA too.  The things on the court are just simply amazing for a dude his size with his longevity. All the wear and tear and he can still play at an MVP level and it shows when a team with another top 10 NBA guy looks like a lottery team with James out. 8 straight Finals appearances, East or not, is still amazing as hell. Jordan will always be #1 to me but LeBron is right up there in his range."
"In 2018 Jaylen Brown led the Celtics in scoring**, and was arguably the best perimeter defender, even whilst guarding/being guarded by Lebron James, on a Boston team that got to within one win of the NBA Finals.  ** outside the 5 games he was injured"
No. That was absolutely the right move even if he leaves since they had LeBron James on the roster.
"&gt;The fact that you just cherry pick words means there's not much discussion left to be had. Nash led the top offense in the league while being the best play maker and facilitator. He was also arguably the best shooter, team leader, and crunch time performer.  Nash leading the top offense in the league doesn't mean he's a better offensive player than LeBron James who had much worse support around him. Do you think Nash is leading top offense in Cleveland? No? Then why raise that point when comparing him another player who is a worse circumstance. Not all situations are equal. So you don't compare players by team results. Nash was the best shooter in those years, factoring in off the dribble creation. He was not the best *scorer* in those years, however. I'd like to know by what measurement he was the best crunchtime performer and how the hell you're quantifying leadership.  &gt;The East was the weakest it's ever been then, so Nash's Suns having four more wins is infinitely more impressive. MVP has always been a measure of the best player that particular season.  Not more impressive when Nash had a much better supporting cast than LeBron that year. The team result isn't evidence of player value, its evidence of player circumstances.   &gt;Camby was a better individual defender as evidenced by his superior statistical season. Imagine a player being worse in literally every traditional stat and trying to just hand wave it away.  The exact issue with traditional stats is that they don't capture impact and only the accumulation of numbers. They do not capture the possessions that Duncan prevents shot attempts from being taken to begin with by cutting off driving lanes or discipline in selectively chasing after blocks rather than jumping at every opportunity (Camby). By your logic Camby is a better defender than Duncan ever was. Do you think this? Let me know so I can put you on ignore.   &gt;Bowen was a proven all-defender before ever being a Spur.  Never in the DPOY discussion before Duncan.  &gt;Burden of proof lies with you to prove he wouldn't have been as good of a defender.  Didn't say he wouldn't have been as good a defender. The recognition for his defense would be lost without playing next to generational talent like Duncan who gave Bowen the platform to showcase his strengths.      &gt;Shaq being more dominant doesn't mean he had a better season.   Repeat this back to yourself. Please. X player being more dominant doesn't mean they had a better season. What are you even saying."
"This reminds of basic physics homework. Imagine getting a problem like   &gt;""LeBron James runs the full length of a basketball court (94 feet) at a velocity of 23.5 ft/s. How long did it take LeBron to run the lenght of the court?""   and your answer is 4 seconds. I would stop and check my math lol"

"LOL, of fucking course he wouldn't.  You need a viable 2nd-3rd option and fucking decent supporting cast in order to sniff the finals.  Fucking Lebron James last year didn't make the fucking playoffs because of the shit cast he was surrounded with."
I like how the title is “COOKS LeBron James” instead of “Cooks the Heat”
"I genuinely feel bad for young haters who don't realize how special it is to sportshate a top ten player ever.   Haters are obviously immature and unable to give credit to the fact that the people they hate, are actually providing them entertainment that captivates them and they fixate on.   The constance of Hating LeBron has given content to 20 years of barbershop fights, 20 years of memes, 20 years of otherwise rational adults screaming at children &amp; bandwagoners &amp; stans &amp; haters online.   The haters that grow out of hating learn, in retrospect, to love their targets for all that glee and debate and schadenfreude they got out of the people they spent so much time bashing.   When I was getting into my 20s, it crept up. I stopped ""cringing"" at anything anymore. I started accepting goofiness and childishness back into my life. I started realizing that I could not like someone such as, say Amy Schumer, but also dislike all the obnoxious and repetitive attempts to destroy her while constantly looking for validation from the Bitchy Internet.   One of my moments of maturing was realizing how much I was gonna miss sportshating Peyton Manning. All the daily shit talking about him, all the denigrating his legacy (*HE HAD HGH SHIPPED TO HIS HOUSE! MEDIA GOLDEN CHILD NEVER GOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE! HE SHOULDA GOT A FRAMED PICTURE OF THE DENVER DEFENSE &amp; THE SKILL POSITION PLAYERS INSTEAD OF A BRONCOS RING!) I was so wrapped up in it that I refused to accept that I saw a Top 5 QB play his entire career and I literally never once appreciated anything he did on the field. I got so much out of hating on the guy, making my contributions to the Bitchy Internet, arguing about what a Choker he was. Getting genuinely angry about his HGH fueled 12head being swept under the rug while people argued about football air and PSI.   Im probably gonna cry when Peyton dies. I fucking love that guy now. I put the black hat on him and made him the Antagonist for 20 memorable, fun years of rooting against him. He broke my heart in 07, and helped me appreciate the last 3 Superbowls more than the first 3.   Peyton was a huge star and an all timer, but LeBron James might be on the Mount Rushmore of targets of the Bitchy Internet. At the beginning of the season, he was interviewed and awkwardly answered a question in real time attempting to convey that he was worried about himself and his teammates. And haters reacted like he"
when bill simmons was a fun read - nobody shrinks the floor like lebron james
LeBron James
"So you’re telling me Lebron James did that in the cavs, when he was literally the best player on the team"
"you know who else was playing big minutes? first ballot Hall of Famers LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh.  LeBron by himself is basically a complete offensive system. surround him with defensive players and you're golden.  you should probably think hard about why the Mavericks' championship run is widely, and I mean *widely* considered an underdog story.  also, if you think Iguodala and Livingston weren't major contributors to the Warriors, you didn't watch them a whole lot.  curiously, are you basing these questions off Basketball-Reference data?"
I think this is completely wrong thing as the 16 Cavaliers from incredible performances by Kyrie Irving and LeBron James beat the most winningest team in NBA history.
"Whenever I pointed this out I get jumped by a bunch of people that say ""but look, he has insane .62Ts% it doesn't matter he still score very efficiency"" but his TS% kept dipping and dipping as the year went on and is now like .58. Players like Harden, Lillard, Curry, or other young playes like Trae Young and Devin Booker score way more efficiently. There is zero relationship between guard rebounding and winning and the Mavs almost rebound as good with Luka on the court as off so his rebounding numbers don't impress me. On top the Mavs defense is much worse when Luka is on the court compared to off but since he gets high rebounding numbers a lot of those box office based advanced stats like BPM, RAPTOR, etc etc have rebounding in their defensive formula which is ridiculous so players like Doncic look good while players like Klay Thompson look bad. Doncic is the most overrated player in the entire NBA, people are comparing him to a young Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, and Lebron James."
only 5 players have averaged 20-5-5 during their rookie year:  Oscar Robertson Michael Jordan LeBron James Tyreke Evans Luka Dončić
"Nah nah nah, y’all are misunderstanding. The man’s trying to say that the cavaliers support the king (LeBron James)"
"Steph Curry  Klay Thompson   Kevin Durant  Lebron James  Draymond Green  1 all star, best lineup out here if they all played today"
"&gt; So be honest - do you think Steve Nash was better than LeBron James in both of those seasons. Steve Nash was NOT in the convo for best player in the association in either '05 or '06. But he got the awards because he had the best story of all the candidates and fell into a circumstance that fit his talents perfectly. The award does not and never has meant best performing player.  There is so much to unpack with all these loaded statements. Yes, I do. Yes, he was. He dominated the league offensively and raised the ceilings of his teammates more than any other player then. He also helped popularize a style of play that changed the game. He was the best play maker and facilitator. He was also arguably the best shooter, team leader, and crunch time performer. And the award has always been synonymous with the best player in a given year. There are exceptions, yes, but they are far and few. The award had even more credence when the players themselves voted.   &gt; Camby looking better on a bbref page is why he won DPOY. Duncan was the boring pick. Substance over flash? Not appreciated.   Camby did that year what Duncan never did once in his entire career. Camby led the league in blocks and became second all-time for most Block titles with 3, joining Johnson, Mutombo, Olajuwon and Ratliff. Camby's numbers look better because he was a better defender than Duncan that year. Not offensively or a player as a whole, but defensively.   &gt; Bruce Bowen is not recognized as one of the best defensive wings of all time without Duncan flanking him and cleaning up for his mistakes.  Simply not true. Bruce was 2nd team All-Defense on the Heat before he went to the Spurs. Who are you to say he couldn't have been just as successful a defender on a different team?  &gt; They categorically do not get MVP correct because it doesn't measure for the postseason, where the best players in the league are truly decided, and fall victim to hype trains frequently. Thats how Iverson won MVP over a much better player in Shaq in 2001.  MVP is a measure of the regular season -- so yes, playoffs have nothing to do with it. Did you watch that season? Iverson was the face of the league, electrifying, must-see TV, and was leading the league in scoring/steals at barely 6 foot. Shaq may have been more dominant, but he wasn't having as special a season as Iverson did. He also got statistically worse from his MVP season the previous year, whereas Iverson had his career year up to that point."
Marcus Smart   Jaylen Brown   Bojan Bogdanovic   LeBron James   Jaren Jackson
Mike Conley   Lou Williams  Danilo gallinari  LeBron James  Serge ibaka
"&gt;What he did those years arguably made him the best and most impactful player in the league then. MVP voting is largely correct or has the top 3-5 players in the running. It's more something to point to during that particular NBA climate.  So be honest - do you think Steve Nash was better than LeBron James  in both of those seasons. If you put LeBron James on those Suns versus the shitty Cavs what do you think would happen. Honestly. Steve Nash was NOT in the convo for best player in the association in either '05 or '06. But he got the awards because he had the best story of all the candidates and fell into a circumstance that fit his talents perfectly. The award does not and never has meant best performing player.  &gt;Camby beat Duncan in mostly all block, steal, and rebound stats. A league leading 3.3 blocks per game to Duncan's 5th place at 2.4. Camby led the centers with 1.2 steals per game. Duncan was far behind at 0.8. Camby also beat him in total defensive rebounds, rebounds per game, defensive rebound %, total rebound %, block %, steal %, and defensive box +/- while simultaneously having way less fouls.  All of those things and his team didn't miss him when on the bench in a 1500 minute sample size. Meanwhile the Spurs go from an all time great defense with Duncan on the floor to just good without him.  Bruce Bowen is not recognized as one of the best defensive wings of all time without Duncan flanking him and cleaning up for his mistakes. Bowen DIRECTLY benefited from playing with Tim. Tim was DOMINANT defensively BEFORE and AFTER Bowen entered the picture. They did take votes away from each other, this is true. But that is precisely an issue with awards voting when they struggle to figure out who the best o na team is.  &gt;It's corroboration. They largely get the votes correct, or at the least have the top 3-5 players at the top of their voting.  They categorically do not get MVP correct because it doesn't measure for the postseason, where the best players in the league are truly decided, and fall victim to hype trains frequently. Thats how Iverson won MVP over a much better player in Shaq in 2001."
"Steph, despite being the obvious best and most important player on the Warriors that year, received zero votes for FMVP. There have been claims of a literal conspiracy by voters, but I'm not going to say those are legitimate, though I will say that they're believable. But Iguodala is easily the worst FMVP in the last 30 or 40 years, and you can do the reading on that if you want, it's out there. Ask anyone who watched that series (kinda sounds like you didn't) and 9/10 will tell you Steph was robbed.   But you can think what you want. The winningest MVP of the 2010's outside LeBron James still needs to prove he's a winner, sure."
I dunked over LeBron James in a pickup game.
[He was already being anointed as a junior](https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTY4MjYzMjM5MzEzNzk0MzI1/lebron-james-coverjpg.jpg)
Lakers. They traded their future cause they wanted to win now assembling a team around LeBron. Unfortunately James is not going to be any younger next year.
"West:  PG - John Stockton (Jazz), Chris Paul (Clippers), Oscar Robertson (Kings) SG - Clyde Drexler (Trail Blazers), Kobe Bryant (Lakers), Allen Iverson (Nuggets) SF - Kevin Durant (Sonics/Thunder), Tom Chambers (Suns), Rudy Gay (Grizzlies PF - Kevin Garnett (Timberwolves), Anthony Davis (Pelicans), Dirk Nowitzki (Mavericks) C - David Robinson (Spurs), Wilt Chamberlain (Warriors), Hakeem Olajuwon (Rockets) Coach - Pop   East: PG - Isiah Thomas (Pistons), Kyle Lowry (Raptors), Kemba Walker (Hornets) SG - Michael Jordan (Bulls), Dwyane Wade (Heat), Reggie Miller (Pacers) SF - LeBron James (Cavaliers), Larry Bird (Celtics), Julius Erving (Nets) PF - Charles Barkley (76ers), Elvin Hayes (Bullets/Wizards), Bob Pettit (Hawks) C - Patrick Ewing (Knicks), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Bucks), Shaquille O’Neal (Magic) Coach - Phil Jackson  I think it’s very close, but the East wins this all-time battle."
Lebron James need to stop taking HGH. His hairline fucked up from the HGH.
"“Lebron is overrating Dr. J and underrating Bird, Magic, Kareem, Wilt, Oscar, and a number of others”  - u/Easter-Worshipper on future hall of famer Lebron James selecting his personal top 3 players of all time, demonstrating a superior bbiq."
"I'll admit that it was a goaltend and that my LeBron bias was showing there.    [However, they Pacers still shouldn't have had possession of the ball.](https://twitter.com/TomerAzarly/status/989610247709863937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E989610247709863937&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcavsnation.com%2Fcavs-news-l2m-report-says-pacers-thaddeus-young-tipped-ball-lebron-james-goaltended-victor-oladipo%2F)"
"That's not how things work. If a GM could sign Prime Michael Jordan or Prime LeBron James to a max contract, I imagine most would choose Jordan."
"It's not exactly this that people miss, people miss hard defense and players actually being able to physically do stuff in the game. Nowadays players are getting called for fouls for bad breath and travels are basically never called anymore, people feel that the game was more pure back in the 80's and 90's and less of a TV show.  Half of the players in the league travel every 2 dribbles and if LeBron James drives to the basket you can't really hard foul him, because if you do you might get thrown out of the game.  Great players would be great in every era, but if you think for one second that scoring today isn't easier compared to back then because the physicality has been shifted out of the game, you are crazy."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
Rewatching Space Jam last night made me realize that a sequel with LeBron James is a doomed project. The circumstances and context around the original are all too perfect.
Steph curry  Kobe Bryant  Lebron James  Tim Duncan  Shaq
EAST:  Atlanta Hawks: Dominique Wilkins   Boston Celtics: Larry Bird  Brooklyn Nets: Jason Kidd  Charlotte Hornets: kemba walker  Chicago Bulls: Michael Jordan   Cleveland Cavaliers: Lebron James  Detroit Pistons: Rasheed Wallace  Indiana Pacers: Reggie Miller  Miami Heat: Dwayne Wade  Milwaukee Bucks: Kareem Abdul-Jabaar  New York Knicks: Carmelo Anthony   Orlando Magic: Dwight Howard  - Philadelphia 76ers: Wilt Chamberlain  Toronto Raptors: Kawhi Leonard  Washington Wizards: Chris Webber   PG: LBJ/Kidd/Kemba  SG: MJ/Dwade/Wilkins  SF: Kawhi/Melo/ Reggie PF: Larry/Webber/Sheed C: Kareem/wilt/Dwight
"Just spit-balling some possibilities:  1) **He was out in Sacramento during a rough stretch of Kings basketball**. Outside of the Webber era, the Kings have had a tough time getting attention, particularly out East. Even when Webber was dealt out there, there was sort of a notion that he'd been banished. The only reason he stayed relevant is because he won. Speaking of which...  2) **Cousins' teams didn't win**. He wasn't frequently supported with great talent but there *is* something to say for lifting up those around you. Sometimes it seemed like his performances were in a vacuum, where he was out there getting his and if the team didn't win then it wasn't his damn fault. Speaking of which...   3) **Cousins' attitude**. There's usually been two camps here - those who felt Cousins was justified in his behavior and those who felt he was acting like child and deserved no quarter. Generally speaking, I tend to believe someone's either a part of the solution or a part of the problem. With the matter with which Cousins carried himself, I don't know how often his attitude was a part of the solution.   If you really get down to it, players can be judged by their box score but the real question regarding one's basketball skill likely has to do with how much they're improving their team's chances to win. It's why Jason Kidd could run a 4, 6, and 12 statline and still be the most valuable player on the floor. And it's why Ricky Davis could drop 37 and still somehow negatively affect his team's chances at victory.   With DeMarcus Cousins, you'd kind of figure that he were *really* a super all-star asset that his performances would have translated to lifting his team up more often and winning more games collectively. As a super extreme example, we're seen LeBron James carry a pile of corpses to the finals. So much of his game, at his best, is about improving his team's chances of winning. I think, taking the things mentioned above into account (bad teams, attitude, big stats little results) it's probably easy for folks to write Cousins off to some degree."
PG: Chauncey Billups  SG: Kobe Bryant  SF: Lebron James  PF: Chris Bosh  C: Anthony Davis
"Right, because Duncan lost athleticism very early on. What I'm saying more so is that if you told me someone with Dwight's athletic profile would come into the NBA and ""only"" average 19 a game at his peak, I'd have been surprised. I thought Dwight was going to be Shaq, but he ended up being more like Alonzo Mourning. It's like if LeBron James turned out to have an Andre Iguodala career."

"This is true, I mean heck they even say that about Lebron James but all the announcers talk about how freakishly athletic the league would be and how it would be unfair if you took Lebron from today's game and dropped him into the 70' 80' and 90's.  People just can't let go lol"
Going to try this blind with no google. These are all guesses I'm not 100% sure on.  1. Scott Skiles  2. 1979  3. Mario Chalmers  4. LeBron James  5. I have no idea lol
"Atlanta: Dominique Wilkins  Boston: Larry Bird  Chicago: MJ  Cleveland: Kyrie Irving  New York: Walt Frezier  New Jersey: Jason Kidd  Milwaukee: Kareem Abdul jabbar  Charlotte: Larry Johnson  Orlando: Shaq  Toronto: Kawhi Leonard  Indiana: Reggie Miller  Philadelphia: Wilt  Miami: Lebron James  Detroit: Isaiah Thomas  Washington: Elvin Hayes    I just think that prime MJ and prime Lebron are two best players to ever play. With Larry Legend, Isaiah at pg and Wilt Kareem and young Shaq,i think they would beat the west :)"
"Almost all champion superstars win multiple rings. The last two examples of those who won only one are Dirk and Kevin Garnett.  Garnett won his ring in the tail end of his prime as part of a perceived superteam with Paul Pierce and Ray Allen.  Dirk on the other hand is seen as winning his ring in his prime with no star teammates. He’s also seen as singlehandedly pushing back the LeBron James/Miami Heat dynasty.  I might go so far as to say no other athlete has benefited from a ring more than Dirk has, though I will also say his single championship run is one of the greatest I’ve seen."
"See, I just don’t believe this for a second. Like, really? We really believe that Wilt was just so much stronger, faster, and more athletic than every person who ever lived in every way?   That’s why I find so many of these Wilt stories so dubious because they’re basically saying that someone once existed who was basically 10x the athlete that LeBron James is, and that would basically make them a superhero."
Steph Won MVPs over Prime Lebron James
"2018 finals, first game, Lebron James."
"Lamelo is a playmaker much like trae young, luka doncic. Lonzo is a floor general much more like jason kidd and lebron james. They have very very different games. The hype with Lamelo is that he's a much more talented player than his brother was. Lonzo was never able to finish at the rim or score in crafty ways like Lamelo can. Lonzo was very stiff with his dribbles and although has a nice stepback he's not a ballhandler who can ""improvise"" against defenses. Lonzo was always a much more meticulous, llook for the open guy down the court or in half court kind of guy. Lamelo can almost break a defense at will and create passing angles for his teammates using combinations of ball fakes, head fakes, dribbling moves, and spins on passes. That's extremely hard to replicate and takes natural skill that not many players in the nba even have."
Wade literally won his second ring playing next to LeBron fucking James and this guy wants to talk about asterisks
I know not every team is built like the warriors and you can win multiple ways. I used those examples because you used him playing with LeBron and  playing within Brad Stevens system as an excuses for his low assists numbers. I reminded you that Westbrook also played with KD and still put up better assist numbers. I brought up James harden to compare him and LeBron James as teammates. They both like the ball in there hands and most possessions run through them when they are on the court. So I brought up the dribble stat to show you the Westbrook has the ball way less and is still averaging more assist per game than Irving ever did. Your first two paragraphs back up my Westbrook point
That was easy   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2744214-lebron-james-calls-himself-king-of-new-york-after-win-vs-knicks
"I mean, Lebron sometimes calls himself king James even if it's just in jest and such if the Mamba thing is ok. I thought it'd be ok because Kobe named himself the nickname.  Given that, you really can't give a man who appears in commercials with crowns a looser meaning of the word refer? Like it's an expression?  Like, again, i don't literally call myself my name in front of a mirror to catch my attention . Other people call me that. But the general expression is that i call myself by it  and, outside of the usual joke, nobody generally wonders about it.  Like yes, Chef Curry is a thing. Like the Brow. Chef Harden is too even if the beard is more popular (he used to do that cooking thingy after hitting threes)"
"Gobert for Lebron James and a 1st round pick. Sounds like a fair deal for me, Lakers should consider it"
"&gt; It's literally no different from any other nickname, like Magic, EasyMoneySniper, Chef Curry, The Klaw, The Truth, Flash, His Airness, Spider, The Big Fundamental etc.  This is a better point  &gt;I also don't believe he has a tattoo saying ""King James""  I think he does. He has the chosen one in the arm and king in the back or viceversa.  &gt;or refer to himself as such  But this i really don't understand. Nobody refers to himself in the third person. The moment Lebron aknowledges it, tattoos it and marketes it is like calling himself king. He didn't say he baptised himself as king."
"It's a nickname, one that he didn't give himself and that he likes.  It's literally no different from any other nickname, like Magic, EasyMoneySniper, Chef Curry, The Klaw, The Truth, Flash, His Airness, Spider, The Big Fundamental etc. I also don't believe he has a tattoo saying ""King James""   I actually don't know what the other guy is saying because LeBron didn't give himself the nickname or refer to himself as such, other people call him that and he likes the name"
"I saw yesterday that that LeBron James Haters United Facebook page has like other pages for different countries lol   There's a US, Brazil, Italy, Philippines, etc.  That alone tells you how dedicated they are. At the very least, the haters and stans are tied.  Oh and I also saw a video that talks about Bronny James being overrated hahahaha"
"Bron and Kyrie scored the same amount of points, so the points category should be tied instead of just showing Bron. And my comment wasn’t a dig at OP, it was to show how the media gives LeBron all the props so fanboys like yourself can cream yourself while ignoring anything noteworthy that his teammates did.

"The frustrating thing is that you guys were in the right direction last season, and then hired the only head coach to miss the playoffs with LeBron James on his team in 15 years. Sometimes I think Vlade isn't an idiot, that he's made some moves to put a lot of young talent on that team, made some good decisions since he traded Boogie away, and it seems like the Kings are a couple solid veterans and a smart coach away from being a 6 seed, and other times I think Game of Zones has him fit to a T."

"This is not exactly the same thing as what you asked (being able to field 5 shooters), but in terms of what was actually played most, here's a look at every champion since 2010.  [The 2010 Los Angeles Lakers](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2010-nba-finals-celtics-vs-lakers.html) included Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom, Andrew Bynum in their top 6 of Finals Minutes played, with Lamar Odom's 1 for 10 being the best mark of that group. In fact, those Lakers only have 4 players who shot more than 30% from 3 in the Finals.  [The 2011 Dallas Mavericks](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DAL/2011.html) 5th and 6th most minutes played players were Tyson Chandler, [who has never attempted a 3pt shot in the NBA](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/chandty01.html), and Shawn Marion, who shot 15% that season [and has a career 3pt% of 33%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mariosh01.html), which is honestly surprisingly high. In 2011, he hadn't shot above 30% since 2008.  [The 2012 Miami Heat](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIA/2012.html) featured Chris Bosh, Dwayne Wade, Udonis Haslem and Joel Anthony all playing more than 20 MPG in the regular season and shooting less than 30% from 3, if they shot them at all. [In the Finals vs the Thunder](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2012-nba-finals-heat-vs-thunder.html), every single player on their team that played more than 40 minutes shot more than 40%, except for Udonis Haslem... and LeBron James, who shot 19% from 3 that series. I will also note that Dwayne Wade is a career [29.3% 3pt shooter](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wadedw01.html), despite the small sample size theater of the Finals.  [The 2013 Heat](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2013-nba-finals-spurs-vs-heat.html) heavily featured Wade in the Finals, who didn't attempt a single 3, and Chris Bosh, who missed all 6 of his attempts in the series. LeBron shot 35%.  [The 2014 Spurs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2014-nba-finals-heat-vs-spurs.html) had Tim Duncan, who didn't make his only attempt.  [The 2015 Warriors](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2015-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html) had Draymond Green shooting 26% and Shawn Livingston 0 for 1.  [Cleveland, 2016](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2016.html), started Tristan Thompson, who never took a 3 that season. [In the finals, only 3 of the 7 players who played more than 100 minutes shot above 30% from deep, if they shot at all](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2016-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html). In that series, Kevin Love shot 26%, Richard Jefferson shot 17% and Iman Shumpert shot 27% from deep. Their next highest minutes played was Matthew Dellavadova, who shot 17% from 3 as well.  [Golden State still fails to have the top 5 shoot &gt;30% from 3 in 2017](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2017-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html), due to Draymond's 28%. Their 6th man, Shawn Livingston, didn't attempt a single 3.  [In 2018, the Warriors still failed due to Draymond and Shawn Livingston](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2018-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html), plus Javale McGee and Jordon Bell who were quite close in raw minutes to Livingston.  [In 2019, Pascal Siakam bars the Raptors due to his 24% from 3](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-finals-warriors-vs-raptors.html). Norman Powell didn't play that many minutes but shot only 17%.  In conclusion, no champion from the past decade has won playing 5 shooters – as definted by your criteria – the most minutes in the Finals."
"even Lebron would disagree with you but if that's what you think, okay lol  &gt; “I think about it all the time,” James said of that 2007 series. “I even go back and watch some of those games and see how I wasn’t that good of a player, especially on both ends of the floor. You just try to use those moments. I feel like there’s no way I should be out on the floor and the team that I’m on can’t win a game in a series. I use that as motivation. … I’ve got a lot of motivation.”"
"Fuck these fucking cheaters   I hate the nba refs , lebron James and cunts like Thompson"

"And I think you're unfairly cornering Zion into a prototype. He's far more athletic than Barkley was, and barkley was a beast. And it seems you're too young to have remembered that both Wade and Bron were trash shooters when they came into the league. But keep telling me how the guy who was the most hyped draft pick since LeBron James, is less likely to win a chip than Trae Young.  So no it is more absurd to compare Trae Young the guy who isn't shooting at the level Steph Curry was at this point in his career to Steph Curry, than it is to compare Zion to guys like Dwade and Bron who also couldn't shoot early on, but created looks for themselves at the same rate as him.  And on top of all of this, little dudes just don't win rings as the stars. I can think of only two. Curry and Isiah. That's not a lot of historical precedent. Guys who can athletically overpower their opponents though? Littered with chips."

"The whole team was structured around Westbrok, like a Lebron James team BUT with the difference that Russ can't do the same job.

He got the Lebron James treatment.  People become so accustomed to his game that they stop giving it appreciation
Lebron James Syndrome
"Yeah, Lebron would have been inspired by the movie and had Paxson salary dump Luol Deng and taken the boys (Wade and Bosh) to Chicago to team up with Rose, Noah, Taj Gibson, and James Johnson, and then with the Bulls taking Jimmy Butler with the 30th pick in the draft after his first season, he probably would have won every championship from 2011-2016. Then when the cap spiked, Kevin Durant would have taken the even harder hardest road and joined the Bulls and they would have won the last three championships as well."
Lebron would be looked at even worse. Chicago and Jordan's story is one of growth and constant evolution to the point of dominance. Lebron leaving was the polar opposite. He got a lot of hate for leaving the first time as a free agent and this doc coming out in 2010 would make it even harder to be Lebron James. The timing of the doc would be poisonous to public perception of lebron.
"You’re not being logical about it. Objectively Jordan never had a moment like Lebron under pressure. He’s never been outplayed by JJ Barrea. That’s a fact.   Approaching? He’s not the best passer of all time tho is he? He’s not going to finish as the best passer of all time either.   Most versatile defender of all time? How are you objectively measuring that? Jordan was a better defender. That I can base off the eye test and his individual defensive accolades. And best open court defender of all time? Based on what lol?  Best inside finisher of all time? What are you even talking about here man? You’re not using logic at all lol. Guys like Shaq existed. Hell guys like Jordan himself existed.   Lebron James is not the best driver in basketball history lmfao. No offense bc I’m not personally attacking you at all but the longer I read the more unraveled your argument gets. You’re just throwing shit at the wall and hoping it sticks.   Lebron is not going to win another two titles tho. And even if he does Kobe already has 5 titles. If that’s all it took, by your logic, Kobe is better than Lebron lol.   Lebron can’t match up to the picture perfect career of MJ. That’s not a slight to him. It’s an insurmountable task. But it’s why he’s not the GOAT. GOAT can’t have 2011 type moments. He can’t call himself the GOAT when his own peers recognize Jordan as GOAT. What Jordan did was legendary while he was still playing. Lebron still hasn’t lived up to that.   Hell if Lebron 3peated right now I’ll say that he then has a legit argument to be GOAT alongside Jordan. That would at least make them equals. But to surpass Jordan you have to be able to surpass his impressive collection of individual accolades, clutch under pressure moments &amp; two 3peats. It’s a picture perfect scenario. It’s not fair but that’s the point. It’s the GOAT convo &amp; there are no excuses.  When ppl were in awe of MJ &amp; the things he did it felt entirely natural bc he was doing incredible things. With Lebron (maybe bc of social media) everything seems so forced &amp; manufactured. ESPN will put up his highlights even if he lost lol."
"Most people bitch about him padding stats. Listen, he goes out there 100%, every play and with that type of intensity he's always all over. His competitive nature is near Jordan in the way he thinks, if you not gonna do it I'll do it then type mentality. Three straight seasons, not just one. Not one and then another a few years later. Three in a row. Had this been LeBron instead, the amount of dick sucking everyone would do for him would be insurmountable to how great he is, blah blah. People say, well of course LeBron could do it...well...he hasn't and Westbrook has three in a row.   Is Westbrook better than James, not what this means but he is going to be a first ballot HOF and should be acknowledged as one of the top/great players the last 10-15yrs."
"D-Wade won a chip before LeBron got there but let’s not forget who was on that team. That team had **talent**. Shaq, White Chocolate, and old but not out Glove, Antoine Walker was still producing, James Posey from three was a weapon, a younger Haslem on the boards.   AD had Jrue, Boogie, and a revolving cast of disappointing performers around him. And they were still making playoffs in a brolic Western Conference."
LeBron took the warriors to 6 with Matthew Dellavedova and James Jones.
"One reason is the stat chasing. He definitely gets a little more shit than he deserves over it and I don’t like him so I dog on him for it too. Still, he does make passes specifically to record assists, not necessarily for a better shot or for ball movement. He steals rebounds. He chucks up shots and generally plays inefficiently. This is why no one really cares  Another reason is that it hasn’t correlated to winning. He’s got MVP awards and scoring titles, but no rings. His teams haven’t even really been strong contenders. This is basically the same as putting up crazy stats on a garbage team, but the team around him was actually decent.  There’s also plenty of players putting up stupid numbers currently. James Harden, Steph Curry, Jokic, LeBron, and many others are posting some crazy stat lines at the same time as Westbrook and distracting from his stats."
"My cousin was a huge Kobe and Lakers fan.  Lakers were playing the Heat and the Heat demolished them. (Maybe time passing just made me think they got demolished idk) I asked who the guy with the headband was and he said LeBron James which was a name I heard before.  From that day on I was officially a LeBron fan.  I’m 15 years old for reference, and was raised playing soccer exclusively."
"All of this makes sense until you consider that he is 120-36 when he gets a triple double. That's ridiculous. Lebron is 86-31 when he scores a triple double and James Harden is 49-10. The argument breaks down when it is absolutely obvious that his team wins 83% of the time he scores a triple double. My first comparison is also what happens when other players play at their best. If you take Steph Curry, and filter by 50/40/90 games, he is 152/190. That is 80% win rate which is lower but close enough for me to say their impacts are similar during any given game. When hen you look at James Harden his win rate when he is 50/40/90 is 77/95 or 81%. If you want to say he isn't clutch or he doesn't pass the playoff eye test, go ahead. In the playoffs he is 10-5 when he scores a triple double. I probably agree with you. But it's a false narrative that his triple doubles don't translate to wins."
"I kind of agree, but probably for different reasons. I think the players that have the capability to do what Westbrook did, do not have the right team circumstances to make it happen.   For instance, you'd have trouble convincing me that if Lebron James from 08-14 told his teammates ""Stand on the perimeter and shot any time I pass it to you shoot it and box out for me for rebounds, I'm going to be trying to get a triple double for the entire season"", that he couldn't average a triple double for most of those years. The reason you don't see that is:  1. Lebron James is good enough that you expect for his team to be a contender every season.  2. Having a player go for a triple double isn't necessarily the best way to win.  3. None of those Lebron teams had the weird situation of another star leaving to make it acceptable to build the offense around one player getting a specific stat line.   While there aren't a many players that could do it, I think there is a small handful of players that could get it done if the organization was willing to change the entire offense to make a triple double happen for their star player."
"The Rose injury really benefited Lebron. There is no way to know if any of those Bulls teams would have beat the Miami or Cleveland teams, but he was the only superstar drafted by an Eastern Conference team for almost an entire decade. It would have been cool to see the Bulls make a trade for James Harden or something like that to add some competition in the East. A very sad injury that really added to the divide between the teams in the East vs the teams in the West."
"IIRC 04 Pistons, all of their players had zero championships. This was their first title for every player, same thing with the Mavericks, it was the final shot for guys like Dirk, Marion, Peja, Kidd, JET etc... Aside from LeBron everyone on the 16 Cavs had never won a title before.   All three of these teams were also going up against super teams made up of 3-4 top 20 players in the NBA, and in the case of the 04 Lakers and 11 Heat, super teams that were ""created"" in the off season rather than via the draft.   04 Lakers:   * Shaq (arguably the best player in the NBA) * Kobe (Top 5 player in the NBA) * Karl Malone (old but still great, one year removed from 20/9/4) * Gary Payton (old but good) * Phil Jackson (GOAT Coach)  11 Heat:   * LeBron James (Best player in the NBA) * Dwyane Wade (Top 5 player in the NBA * Chris Bosh (Top 20 player in the NBA)  16 Warriors  * Steph Curry (Top 3 player in the NBA) * Klay Thompson (Top 15 player in the NBA) * Draymond Green (Top 15 player in the NBA)"
No youre right LeBron James could've never beaten the Utah Jazz with the dreadful supporting cast of Pippen Rodman Kukoc Harper and those boys. Lmao Mj shot 46% from the field that year and averaged 28 and 3 assists..what? They were favored because Vegas thought their team would be able to beat fuckin Utah lol. It's laughable to criticize LeBrons playoff loss against the magic he averaged 40 9 and 9 and his team was literally garbage! There were no above average NBA starters on LeBrons team until he went to Miami thats a fact. And are we acting like the team that was favored over LeBron didn't have KD Westbrook and Harden..? Jesus
"4 points*    I remember it because the warriors were stuck at 89 points for 4 minutes and then Draymond Green cried to Kevin Durant in the parking because his 73 win team needed more help to beat LeBron James and save Steph Currys ""legacy""  Your argument was you didnt think adding 2 all star players would change 2015.   The following year, the Cavs played with those 2 all star players and beat a better Warriors team.  The point was proven.  Forget changing out Kevin Love for James Jones.  If you really think playing a hospitalized Matthew Dellavadova (who was played off the floor in 2016) was better than having Kyrie freaking Irving, im not sure what to even say.  If thats really your stance, I think we're done here."
"Have you read about Harden’s struggles when Russ does well and vice versa? It’s very interesting. IMO it’s because they’re the same archetype of player. Mediocre efficiency, high-usage, stat-oriented leaders. And don’t get me wrong, they’re both great players, I just think it’s interesting that you say Russ is a great second option, because when Russ was succeeding, he became the FIRST option and Harden did horribly. Seems like neither of them can play the second option well.   Side note; I don’t see them going anywhere with this squad, which is really sad, because they have done so much to make this team functional/have star power, but you’re trying to build around a lesser superstar (Harden) whose play-style inherently can’t win a championship, and picking up another lesser superstar of the same variety does not equal a Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, or Steph Curry. Swinging for the fences and ending up with dirt is depressing to watch."
"Kawhi was much more impactful, had better shooting splits, was more efficent despite taking far less attempts.  ----   **Box scores**  - Kawhi Leonard: 27.7/7.8/4.6 on shooting splits 52/45/93 with 16.8 FGA  - LeBron James: 32.8/9.1/7.8 on shooting splits 56.5/41.1/69.8 with 21.3 FGA  **Advanced metrics**  - Kawhi Leonard: 67.2% TS, 10.5 OBPM, 3.7 DBPM, 14.2 BPM  - LeBron James: 64.9% TS, 7.7 OBPM, 2.1 DBPM, 9.8 BPM"

"Totally agree, I’ve never really understood the “Kobe is greater than Duncan” argument. Kobe was the best player on his team on only 2 of his 5 championship runs. For the first 3 titles, Shaq was undoubtably the best player on the lakers, even though Kobe was still really really good (especially during the 01 and 02 finals). But Tim Duncan was the best player on all 5 of the Spurs’ championship squads. I do realize Tim Duncan only won 3 finals mvps, so you might ask “how was he the best player on all 5 teams??”  You can ask any Spurs fan out there, Duncan was the Spurs’ best player in 2007 and was also their best player in 2014, Parker and kawhi just happened to have a better finals series than Duncan those 2 years, doesn’t mean they were better players than him at the time. That would be like saying James Worthy was the best player on the 88 Lakers and Iggy was the best player on the 15 Warriors since they won mvps, but we all know that isn’t true. Furthermore, there is a very solid case that Duncan should have been the finals mvp in ‘14 as he averaged 15 ppg 10 rpg while being an extreme defensive post presence, while kawhi averaged 18 and 6 and really won the mvp for his “defense” on Lebron, where Lebron still averaged 28 and 8 on 57% shooting and 51% from 3. Don’t get me wrong, Kawhi had a fantastic series, but there is not a single Spurs fan who, even one day prior to that series starting, would’ve said kawhi was any better than the fourth best player on the team that season (kawhi only averaged 13 ppg that season). Also, note that had Ray Allen missed that shot in game 6 of the ‘13 finals, Duncan would’ve been finals mvp that year too as he averaged 19 ppg and 12 rpg that series. With all that being said, I think when you compare Duncan’s 5 rings to Kobe’s 5, you have to really look at what I just said here: Duncan was the best player on all 5 championship squads, Kobe was the best player on only 2, 3 at the very best, of his championships teams. Lastly, look at their finals losses. Duncan’s one finals loss was by that miracle Ray Allen shot I mentioned earlier, which took place only after Ginobili and kawhi choked on their game sealing free throws, and then Pop mistakenly took Duncan out of the game on the last play so he wasn’t even on the floor to be able to get the rebound that eventually got passed out to Allen for the 3. Now look at Kobe’s 2 losses: got blown out in 5 games against the underdog pistons (pistons were a great team, but they were still the underdogs, would’ve been a much different story had the lakers lost in 7), and then losing game 6 of the ‘08 finals by 39 POINTS!  With all that being said, I think it’s pretty obvious that Duncan should be ranked higher than Kobe on the all time list, and I’ve never really understood how anyone could argue differently."

"I think it's insane. Is right up there with drew brees stats during his peak and what lebron has done with all the minutes hes played. It's insane.   I know that some people act like well they sort of allowed him to average a triple double by shuffling guys around...but like bruh what were the other teams doing those 3 years? You couldn't get your big guys to box out russ?   Idc what people tell me that three season run by Westbrook kept OKC going. They could have folded and become a dumpster fire like the Knicks but he kept that place bumping.   It's going to be something people look back on in 20 years and just say ""wow that happened."" Like the 100 point game or the time the Pat's came back against Atlanta.   I've been saying it for a while but we are all too deep in the moment to truly appreciate greatness when we see it sometimes. Kind of like how when lebron was up and coming people still talked shit (ok they still do but theres a lot less now). I look at Westbrook haters the way I look at my own James harden hate. I cant stand the guy, his attitude, his style of play, etc. It often means that when he goes 45/10/7 I just shrug. But then I step back and have to admit ""damn I really dont like this dude as a player, and I'm missing something special."" That's how I see the Westbrook hate.   We will likely never see a guy average a triple double over 3 seasons again. And let's remember when he was drafted some people didnt like the pick. Hes been amazing and hes done it all by believing in himself and working on his game, it's very obvious.   So yea I think people overlook that streak and that it's going to be historically a huge sports moment in a few decades."
Lebron james losing his first finals against the warriors
How about that time when all those big ol' women of San Antonio sucked the air out of the arena and almost killed Lebron James
"I don’t know why you’re downvoted so heavily. I agree Ezeli and Varejao shouldn’t have been playing in a do or die game 7 against Lebron fucking James, which is really all you’re saying lol."
THE TAKEOVER  Sebastian Telfair and LeBron James are about to rule the world. Imagine that.
I love how all the people born after 1996 after down voting my comment. Are you guys seriously going to watch a hour documentary of LeBron James Instagram stories ??
"I always wondered if Lebron tried to steal that line 25 years later.  https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lebron-james-theres-a-new-sheriff-in-town-2017-01-31  ""LeBron James to Charles Barkley: ‘There’s a new sheriff in town’"""
"Yeah, it's not when you're talking about Michael Jordan, Kareem, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, or Lebron James"
I imagine the Lakers spend more money per year just paying people to wash LeBron James' balls than $4.6 million.
Lol we got more hate than the Kevin Fucking Durant Warriors. I'll be surprised if it actually passes on to the LeBron James Lakers.
"A point forward is just a big that handles the ball a lot. LeBron James is not a guard he is a sf, giannis is just a power forward that handles the ball he has never in his career been classified as a guard"
"I mean, I think they would have... you can't just force Lebron James and Kyrie Irving to ISO on you all game and expect to come out ahead. And you definitely can't rely on a committee of PJ Tucker, old-ass Trevor Ariza, and James Harden to guard Lebron in ISO. You can switch all you want but Kyrie Irving and Lebron James are both better ISO players than Curry. They are also uniquely unswitchable as a pair: no one has the size and athleticism of Lebron, and no one has the speed and handle of Kyrie. One switchable guy could cover one well, but not both. Even guys like Iggy, Dray, and Klay were getting cooked in ISO in the finals. And all apologies to PJ Tucker, who I fucking love, but both Iggy and Dray are better defenders and it's not super close."
"Bro guys who create at a high level out of the PnR(I.e. make impeccable passing reads) are all expensive. Russell, Kemba, Van Vleet, Dinwiddie: all of them cost something. Devonte is going to command at least 4/51(around the max we can extend him for this offseason) but if he hits 2021 FA he’s not gonna be a Hornet long term, he’s going to command too much money.  You can get 75% of Klay on offence from Duncan Robinson, or Matt Thomas, or in this years draft Isaiah Joe. Guys who can shoot off movement with high basketball IQ are not really that rare IMO.   On defence Klay is harder to replace to be fair.  But like offensively who is similar to Draymond in their ability to grab a rebound and run a fast break putting actual pressure on the basket? DeAaron Fox, Lebron James, prime Rondo, Westbrook, Malik Monk, and...very rarely do you get a PF with Draymond’s north south speed and passing. Like legit Draymond is prob the best passer of any 4/5 in the league, and with that he’s also a way better ballhandler and way faster than a Marc Gasol/Al Horford or even Deni Avdija in the draft. Guys who can run the break and play the 4/5 are super rare=&gt; Kings struggling there too.   If you’re factoring in defence with the ability to run the break off a rebound... apart from Lebron James, who else can do what Draymond does to like 75% of his level. MKG probably does about 60% of what Draymond does overall, and that difference is why Draymond is a starter and MKG(who should be a starter) isn’t used much. Guys who can run the break well are all very good basketball players, but when you factor in defensive impact and basketball IQ in half court settings Draymond is unmatched.  Basically to replace Klay: you could cover 75% of Klay’s offence right now, with like 5M investment, and shifting a few pieces. They can still win a ring, they’d literally run the exact same schemes with Duncan Robinson or Matt Thomas or Isaiah Joe instead of Klay. If you replace Draymond with MKG they’re not close to the same."
"James Harden, The man is near unguardable, He has average defense now but even elite defenders struggle to stay in front of him.   LeBron is a tough one, He's an above average defender, almost elite, when he actually tries but his offense is nearly unstoppable. If he could hit threes consistently he'd be unguardable, But ultimately I don't think LeBron can guard LeBron.  Damian Lillard. This man would kill himself! He has some great offense but what could be described as lazy defense is another thing he has."
"* Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Shaq * Tim Duncan * Bill Russell * Kobe Bryant * Wilt Chamberlain * Stephen Curry * Hakeem Olajuwon * Kevin Garnett * Kevin Durant * Dirk * Jerry West * Chuck * Wade  off the top of my head, these players are/were all better than Isiah Thomas"
were making a documentary on LeBron James or Dwight howard ?
"Again, I’m not saying Love needed more post up opportunities or even that he needed more touches. Just that if thats really the truth, that a guy as skilled as Kevin Love was best used in the Cavs offense as a Channing Frye by sitting in the corner, then you can't ever fault LeBron's teammates for ""not showing up"" ever again  If a guy with as much offensive talent as TWolves KLove has to sacrifice that much of what he can do offensively just for the sake of playing next to Lebron James, then you can’t also turn around and say “Bron’s teammates suck”"
Lebron James has a me too story about how dirk raped him in the finals.
Michael Jordan is better than Lebron James.
"That’s a hit piece by Woj and his “unnamed sources” , literally every quote from back then about Lebron from Coach K was praise about his leadership and professionalism.  &gt;”After the NBA witnessed the behavior of James and his business manager Maverick Carter during the 2007 All-Star Weekend,”  Like seriously what does this even mean?"
"smaller fan base, less demand, means cheaper tickets. i feel that peak Lob City was much more expensive.  when comparing to the Lakers, larger fan bas, higher demand, fucking LEBRON JAMES, mean more expensive tickets. and when looking at road games, Lakers are [number 1](https://i.imgur.com/hCA3hwH.png) because of the larger national fan base and, well, LEBRON JAMES."
"Unpopular: When LeBron James retires and is out of the picture, there will be a new king who fans new to the game will be convinced is the goat... rightfully or not.  Without a goat debate with a current player in the league, the interest in the league will fall and the media won’t let that happen."
"They got one employee they gotta meet payroll on, LEBRON JAMES"
"I watched the whole series that team was not fantastic at all.    ""Cleveland's No. 2 scoring option has provided little help for LeBron James, clanking jumpers and piling up turnovers. Williams is among the biggest reasons the Cavs trail the Magic 2-1 in the best-of-seven series.  He's disappeared.  The All-Star guard hasn't been nearly as efficient or effective as he was during the regular season, when he averaged a career-high 17.8 points. Williams is only 18-for-56 shooting in the series, a lopsided statistic that mirrors many of his teammates who are falling flat in the conference finals, leaving James largely alone to carry the Cavs.  ""Mo and I are getting looks,"" said Cavs guard Delonte West, who had 12 points. ""We're getting good looks. It's just we have to make them.""   That's not what someone who's playing fantastic says in the middle of the series. Yes, the magic were playing well, but the Cavs were also playing really poorly outside of lebron.   I don't know why you're trying to create a false narrative about this."
"And who did wade win the majority of his titles alongside?  LeBron fucking James.  Rings are nowhere near as important as stats in this conversation. Again, basketball is a *team* sport."
Chicks dig the long ball    -Lebron James
"Illmatic alone puts him as the greatest.  It’s the greatest hip hop album ever.    I’m from NYC, born and raised, and I remember when Illmatic came out.  It completely changed the game.  I used to watch Video Music Box with Ralph McDaniels and Flava Videos with Bobby Simmons, and the hip hop world just went crazy once Illmatic dropped.  People knew there was something special coming out of QB because all the best producers of that era (Premier, Pete Rock, Large Professor) wanted to work with this kid from QB.  It was like the hip-hop equivalent of LeBron James hype before he got drafted.  And then the album came out, and no one could say anything.  It was just perfect.  No one heard somebody paint images like that.  There were people were lyrically great and talented, but to drop a whole albums worth of absolute gems was ridiculous."
"exactly. The dude was one of the most skilled big men in the league. The problem was that he was a ball dominant scorer, and he was playing with Kyrie Irving and LeBron James, so he had to basically become a Channing Frye and sit in the corner"
Bill Simmons also watched Derrick Rose play in his prime and concluded that he was more deserving of an MVP award than LeBron James.
"For sure, it get's debatable after Blake, but you also have to factor in guys like LeBron James, Larry Bird, Zach Randolph, Otis Thorpe, Kevin Durant, Elton Brand who are SF/PF or PF/C players.  I think most would take Elton Brand, Jermaine O'Neal and Zach Randolph (who are primarily PFs) over Draymond. They showed they can be the #1 option on a playoff team and in Jermaine's case, the #1 option on a contender."
"Since 1999 to 2018, the NBA finals have included one of: Shaq, Tim Duncan, LeBron James and DJ Mbenga"
"I should have said post 2010 he hasn't been anywhere longer than 4 years, which is what I meant. He has had many chances to get a great coach and has seemingly never demanded one, so he chose not to have one by design, so coaching should be excluded. It's established that Lebron needs vets and catch and shoot players. That's the main offense. That playbook doesn't remove the fact of him being the primary controller of the offense.

That's bullshit lmao. All 3 of them had the thought in their mind. But Riley made it clear while they were pursuing LeBron that Spo was the coach and he had no interest in coming back   https://heatnation.com/media/pat-riley-reveals-lebron-james-wanted-erik-spoelstra-fired-2010/
"I'm gonna split mine into modern and pre modern because guys like Wilt and Russell really shouldn't be compared to guys like Curry and Harden. I'll say that modern players played the majority of their prime after the introduction of the 3pt line.

Jerry West 5. Oscar Robertson 6. Elgin Baylor 7. George Mikan 8. Bob Cousy 9. John Havlicek 10.

"   Ariza, who had accepted a five-year, $33.5 million offer from the Rockets last Thursday, also received telephone calls from James and [Shaquille O'Neal](https://www.espn.com/nba/players/profile?playerId=614). When James told Ariza he'd be a Cavalier past next season, Ariza was less than convinced.  ""He thought it was just a recruiting tool,"" the source said. ""LeBron definitely said it, but until he signs the contract it doesn't mean much.""  he never signed his contract hence the distrust of free agents. They were right to not commit as lebron didn't commit either. What he said and what he did signaled very different things."
"&gt;  STACKED  Lebron had his Pippen and Rodman equivalent. But stacked is pushing it. Miami didn't have money for role players after paying for the big 3. Our other 2 starters were a 35 year old Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Carlos Arroyo, for crying out loud. Our 4th best scorer was James Jones at a whopping 6 points per game."
I remember there being an interview with Tristan Thompson in the 2016 finals run where he explained a similar process. Memorizing the shot tendencies of his Cavs teammates to know where the rebound was going.  Edit: Think it was this: https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/tristan-thompson-offensive-rebounds-stats-cavs-lebron-james-kyrie-irving-kevin-love/1krxjlu4qar7k17u9gjgc72tep
"Really? 1st Heat title team was LeBron, Bosh, Wade, and who? Advanced stats say pretty much everyone else was replacement/average level. Where's the Heat advantage? LeBron is plausibly better that anyone else, but after that every comp favors GSW:  LeBron v KD  Steph v Wade  Klay v Bosh  Dray v Joel Anthony?  Andre v James Jones?  Livingston v. Mario Chalmers?  David West v Mike Miller?"
Riley said he knew what the message was from lebron when he asked if he ever wanted to coach again.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/heatnation.com/media/pat-riley-reveals-lebron-james-wanted-erik-spoelstra-fired-2010/amp/  Also let’s not forget the chest bump in the middle of the game. There was a lot of tension.
"Nobody cares how long you’ve been in sports. If you’re 15, 90% of your life could be doing local soccer since pre-k. You got a degree in sports? You some kind of an expert? Nope? Then nobody cares or wants to hear you try to humble brag about it. Plenty of ppl on here have been involved in sport or have trained &amp; competed myself included. It’s not special. No need to jerk yourself off about it. Doesn’t strengthen your opinion or argument. Weakens it bc now it feels like you’re overcompensating for some reason. I was talking about Jordan vs Lebron. Not you vs me lol. This isn’t and was never personal. Try to stay on topic please.   I’m not saying that to insult Lebron. Nobody comes close to matching that killer will MJ had. It’s not a slight. Kobe was maybe half of what MJ was. Never seen anything like that before.   If you don’t think Kobe Bryant or MJ trained as hard as or harder than Lebron James I don’t know what to tell you. Idc how much LBJ spends lol."
*LeBron James has entered the chat.*
"People freaking out about Rodman taking a vacation mid season obviously forgot Lebron did it also   LeBron James helped turn the Cleveland Cavaliers' season around with a two-week break in Miami early in January. Prior to the break, James and the Cavs looked out of sorts, and James looked noticeably less explosive. James went to Miami to rest his aching knee and back, leaving the Cavs for seven games (during which they went 1-6)."
"Dude MJ fans are the reason this shit gets out of hand. It's ridicuous how people are saying we need to watch this documetatry too and how it should make everyone an MJ is number one fan and to just shit talk Lebron LMAO. I do think MJ is the GOAT but fans are fucking shitheads. I didwatch someparts of it though, but honestly been annoyed with James vs MJ debates and as a Lebron fan, I hate MJ fans to watch their coddling of their boy MJ. It's just not worht it at times."
"It happened to LeBron in 2009 vs Orlando. He responded with:    &gt;After a few more seconds of back and forth, James continued to try to explain his position. ""Teamwork has nothing to do with shaking hands,"" James said. ""I'm not a poor sport at all. You can ask anyone that knows me, I'm not a poor sport at all. Who brought up the rule that shaking hands, that's what you're supposed to do? No one shakes hands at the end of series all the time. No one does that. No one does that at all.""  Very mature and realistic response."
LeBron James walked off after Cleveland lost to Orlando in the 2009 eastern conference finals and hardly anyone talks about that.
1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. Magic Johnson 5. Wilt Chamberlain 6. Bill Russell 7. Larry Bird 8. Tim Duncan 9. Hakeem Olajuwon 10. Shaquille O'Neal   Honorable Mention:  - Kobe Bryant - Oscar Robertson - Moses Malone - Jerry West - Kevin Durant
"Another problem is that Alex was a small forward.  SF is probably the most stacked position of all time. Make a top ten list. You got Lebron and Bird on top... got Durant probably coming in third when it’s all said and done... got legends like Dr J, Rick Barry and Elgin Baylor... prolific champions like John Havlicek, Scottie Pippen and James Worthy... you probably want Kawaii Leonard in there already. Then you say “okay well, he ain’t in the top-10, but now that we done with all those guys could do it all, so now we get to the prolific scorers and now my boy English be in there” but then you got Paul Pierce, Dominique Wilkins and Adrian Dantley. Let’s not even talk about throwing in absolutely monstrous by oft injured players like Bernard King and Grant Hill. NOW you’re talking about English along side Mello and dudes like Chris Mullins and  If English had played shooting guard, maybe we’d think more highly of him because there just ain’t the competition for that spot."
"Jordan literally started a training group outside of team practices because he was obsessed with destroying the Pistons. Pippen, Grant, Harper, BJ, Oakley were all regulars that went consistently on top of official team obligations. Jordan had that much pull as a leader on his team. He was directly responsible for how his teams turned out. Lebron has never done anything remotely similar because he's lazy, and he expects to be spoon fed. When things don't go his way, he'll just trade you or leave the team himself. Lebron can't replicate jordan because he doesn't want to. It's way too hard of a job to do when you can just get a plane ticket out of town. He plays with Dwight Howard, he has won DPOY, more than once as well. No one has played with as much current and past all star talent than Lebron James."
"Isiah calling ""MJ gets away with push, referee can't see that....The thing about MJ is he has all the little tricks"" in Game 6 of the '98 Finals always ticked me off.  I know it's become a standard ""joke"" or even a legitimate jab at MJ that he pushed off on Russell, but in my opinion, it's quite obvious that MJ was hardly putting any pressure on Russell's hip with his left hand, if at all.  I wonder if it would have become a talking point at all if Isiah never said that.  &amp;#x200B;  P.S. I thought you misspelled Lebron James there lol"
Magic Johnson  Stephen Curry  Michael Jordan  Kobe Bryant  Larry Bird  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Tim Duncan  Kevin Garnett  Kareem Abdul Jabbar  Hakeem Olajuwon  Shaquille O'Neal
"The guy Bill Simmons just had on his pod after the NFL draft put it really well. You can make arguments for large parts of Lebrons career that there was someone on his level. Steph at points, KD at points, Kobe, etc. Jordan stood alone. The gap between him and his peers was substantial. Would KD ever go into a series thinking he was the best player in the game and come out of it psychologically broken and admit he didn’t think he could beat Lebron like Barkley did? Would Steph Curry say “It’s just God disguised as Lebron James” and call him the greatest player he’s ever seen like Bird did?"
You think LeBron James would not excel in the 90s when he is at worst a more mobile Karl Malone.
"PG: Ben Simmons  SG: Russell Westbrook  SF: LeBron James  PF: Pascal Siakam  C: Giannis Antetokounmpo  Absolutely no spacing. Every player is a drive and finish/dish guy. Westbrook decides he needs to be the shooter on the team, so takes 10 3pts a game, and makes 3. Teams just pack the shit out of the lane and lets them shoot. I mean, this team would still be incredible, but it would be fairly obvious what you had to do to try stop them."
"&gt;	He had this fire inside him  Just to put it in perspective, when you say that, you have to consider who you're comparing him to. It's not your average Joe, it's Lebron fucking James, who, without a doubt, is extremely driven. But Jordan (and Kobe) were just more intense and kinda insane that way."
With 10 seconds or less left here are the stats:   Michael Jordan: 7/15 (47%) Kobe Bryant: 5/22 (23%) LeBron James: 12/23 (52%)  I’m not sure where you pulled 9/25 when in 10 seconds or less he’s 12/23 but it’s pretty close and Lebron took the lead after 2018
"Without question MJ is one of the top five greatest athletes in ALL of sports. His greatest is undeniable. That said style of the game and rulea do matter. In the era where goaltending was allowed MJ would have struggled to make any mid range or deep shots.   Defensively Jordan would be a much different player. In Jordan's day the game of more physical. Jordan would foul out of games today less he seriously reigned in his aggressive defensive style where it was normal to see him bodying opponents up off the ball outside the key.   Offensively Jordan didn't take many 3 pointers. His 3P% was respectable but be never averaged more than 3 attempts per game throughout his career. In 3 seasons during the 6 in which he won rings MJ averaged LESS that two attempts per game. For comparison Kobe Bryant, the person most often compared to MJ, averaged 5 or more 3 point attempts in 8 separate seasons and had a season where he averaged 7 attempts. That is significantly more.   In today's NBA Jordan would simply have to put up a lot more 3 point shots. LeBron James was/is averaging over 6 attempts per game this season and James isn't in the top 10 for scorers. Harden leads all players and Harden averages over 12 attempts from downtown per game. Even Anthony Davis is averaging as many 3 point attempts as Jordan ever did at his most. Jordan would have to average AT LEAST 200% more 3 point attempts per game than his most active shooting season from downtown. That is the style of play today for starting Shooting Guards.   I would love to say Jordan could have easily halter his game to take me significantly more deep shots but I can't. Jordan was deep shooter. Jordan was a Hustler with a great mid range pull and fade away who could finish at the hoop."
"Definitely not arguing what you said, but where have you seen his rating? I haven't even seen any of the major rating services score him (rivals, scout, 247).   Also, it seems like he didn't really show much this last season, though your points about surrounding talent are noted. I wasn't aware of that  I would argue that pretty much any college would bring him in on name value alone unless he was absolute trash. For sure, ticket sales are going to happen no matter what, but they'll get a ton more exposure, even more than normal, if LeBron James Jr plays for them, no doubt about it.   Nonetheless, you obviously know more about the situation than I do, so I'm not fishing for a debate or anything. Only to say that my initial observations seemed to be that he hadn't really earned on the court the offers that he's getting."
"For once, can ESPN talking heads talk about Michael Jordan without having to bring LeBron James into it. Get Up literally had a “who’s better, Jordan or James” discussion. Isn’t this documentary about the Bulls? Perkins and Rex Ryan are the worst hires ESPN has made in years. Two clowns who start drama for attention."
"Well like I said its lebron james. Cap would be moved for any team he wants to go to. Literally we just saw the Clippers throw away everything for 2 year chance at the title. Every GM is willing to do that. West would move anything to sign Lebron to GS and pretty sure none of that young core was maxed yet anyway.  Morey spent cap on Dwight howard hes moving everything he can to open space for Lebron and Harden.  Its really not that hard to understand the Heat literally did that 3 years before to get Bosh, Wade, and Bron.   The Knicks just did it to try and get Durant and Kyrie. The Nets successfully did it to get them too.  When you have a chance at the top player in the whole league cap gets moved.  I cant even with your second comment about fit. Lebron is maybe the best of all time and making it work with anyone. He brought a skeleton crew to the finals in 07 you think he's not figuring out how to maximize Harden or the young GS core or KD and Westbrook.   Your take is just bad man"
"Actually, as a fun counter-factual, this is the best team I can assemble using those picks (but only using credible picks for the slot taken, so lottery picks for lottery picks, 1st rounders for 1st rounders, no Michael Redd who was taken in the 2nd round despite being one of the top 3 or 4 players in the 2000 draft)  * 1999 - Elton Brand is fine. I mean your other options are Steve Francis/Baron Davis, who have their own issues, or Richard Hamilton. This isn't great for a first overall pick but Elton was a really solid and consistent player and could be your second best player on a championship team.  For the 16th overall pick Metta World Peace is actually, career-wise, the best pick, but you have close to a decade of just insane behavior to work through before he becomes more of a net positive. The only other worthwhile option would be James Posey maybe.   * 2000 - Just the worst, but Marcus Fizer is a shockingly bad choice even in this the worst draft ever. Mike Miller or Jamal Crawford were both credible players playing good minutes on championship contending teams. With #4 and #7 the Bulls could have had both theoretically.  At the 24th, that's close enough to the 2nd to take Michael Redd right? Eddie House is in the top of the 2nd too.  * 2001 - Shane Battier or Joe Johnson. If we go Shane Battier and Mike Miller all we need are Lebron, Wade, and Bosh and we have the Heatles Championship teams. Which is a little ironic because at one point Chicago legitimately thought they'd get Wade and Bosh that free agency period if I remember correctly.  * 2002 - Too bad they didn't get #1 overall, this is the Yao Ming draft. This was a sneaky bad draft too covered up by Yao. Amare Stoudemire is probably the best bet here actually.   So that makes our 2002 opening day roster all on rookie deals still  * Guard - Shane Battier, Michael Redd, Jamal Crawford * Forward - Elton Brand, James Posey, Mike Miller * Center - Amare Stoudemire"
"Regardless of whether what you said is true or not, the question was ""who is a better basketball player?"" The answer to that question is Kyrie Irving.  Kyrie is also not as ball dominant as people think. Since the sample size was not large enough this season, I will use data from the 2018-19 season. He had the ball in his hands for 5.5 minutes per game that year, which ranked 22nd in the NBA. If the amount in which Kyrie Irving handles the ball is not conducive to winning, then neither are the amounts in which Jamal Murray, LeBron James, Ben Simmons, Chris Paul, Mike Conley, and Damian Lillard handle the ball, because guess what? All of them in addition to several more players had the ball in their hands for more time than Kyrie did.  The reason his Celtics did not succeed as much as people thought they would is not because of Kyrie specifically. That team's problem was that there were too many cooks in the kitchen. Kyrie, Rozier, Brown, Tatum, Smart, Morris, Horford, and Hayward all needed the ball, and there were only so many minutes and touches to go around, making all of those players much less effective than they could have been. By letting Kyrie, Horford, Rozier, Morris, and Baynes go, they solved that problem.  The reason the Nets aren't having a successful season is because of injuries. Durant is out all year, Kyrie only played in 20 games (and before you give me some stats about how ""bad"" Kyrie was to the team this season, 20 games is not nearly enough of a sample size), and Caris LeVert missed 25 games. Next season, barring more injuries, the Nets will absolutely be contending for a chamionship.  Yes, Kyrie deserves some criticism, no one is perfect. My problem, however, is that the amount of criticism that Kyrie gets is on the verge of insanity. Every time ESPN has a story about Kyrie, it was based on something blown completely out of proportion. I'll give you an example: This season, Kyrie said to the media that he believed that the Nets needed to add an extra piece in order to contend this season, and proceeded to name a few players that would benefit from that. He didn't happen to mention Jarrett Allen, so ESPN went ballistic and everyone thought Kyrie wanted Jarrett Allen to be traded. Yeah, that happened. And that's not the only time something like that has happened. Look back at every First Take segment about Kyrie the last few years. Every single one of them is heavily, heavily exaggerated. It's egregious.  For some reason, everyone just decides to agree with these takes blindly, and as a result, everyone hates Kyrie Irving. As a Nets fan, do I feel the need to defend him? Absolutely. However, that doesn't make my defense of him invalid. Believe me, I'm thinking very rational about this guy. He is not perfect. He talks to the media a little too much, he cares a little more about his image than most (although that could also be because his image is tainted by the media in the first place), I admit all of this without hesitation. However, is he the toxic villain that everyone in r/nba thinks he is? Not in the slightest."
"I mean it actually has the added benefit of [being the truth](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/03/20/michael-jordan-extends-deal-with-longtime-partner-upper-deck/#33a907e578ea). Upper Deck contractually limits autographs that he can give as a part of a deal he has with them.  And it looks like it works. Just tried to find comparable jerseys between [Jordan](https://upperdeckstore.com/basketball-memorabilia/michael-jordan/michael-jordan-autographed-inscribed-1995-96-white-chicago-bulls-authentic-mitchell-ness-jersey.html) and [Lebron](https://upperdeckstore.com/basketball-memorabilia/lebron-james/lebron-james-autographed-inscribed-2x-finals-mvp-red-heat-jersey-19858.html) on their sports memorabilia site and MJ's is $2,500 USD more expensive than Lebron's.  Even if you don't think those jerseys are comparable, the cheapest Jordan autographed jersey on that site is $8K USD. The Lebron one i linked is the most expensive jersey of his on the site."
The MVP shares leader will probably be LeBron James soon.
Nobody:   Absolutely no one:  You: lEbRon jAmEs.   No one cares about Lebron this is a MJ post
Are you implying the assertion by Mr. Bridges that LeBron James would score 90 points per game in this series against one of the greatest teams ever may be unfounded?
"Yeah the expectations are already crazy, but bronny james already has offers from schools like duke (if I'm remembering correctly) and he seems determined to play with lebron in the league eventually, so he could do much better than jordan's sons"
"What episodes did you watch? I mean, he used some of his power, but it's nothing like LeBron GM James did on the Cavs or what Kawhi has done the last few seasons."

"I want better spacing, so:  PG: Stephen Curry  SG: Michael Jordan  SF: LeBron James  PF; Dirk Nowitzki  C: Hakeem Olajuwon"
"As a guy who doesn't really watch basketball, if you told me Lebron James has been playing since 2003 I wouldnt have believed it. Feels like he only became popular in the past decade."
"&gt; I honestly wonder for those that didnt get to watch mj first hand, do you guys understand how insanely great he was?  Makes me appreciate LeBron James even more because when they're gone, they're gone and very hard to replace."
What you just said you can say about Lebron James. And come on bro it was more than a few. Babe Ruth would probably be the majority of answers to the GOAT question in 1952.

Dwyane Wade or James Harden: Wade  10. Stephen Curry or Luka Doncic: Curry
&gt;	Crazy how he made better roster moves as a player than an actual owner  *LeBron James has entered the chat*
People knew of and will know of JFK more than lebron james. I think JFK didnt have IG but cant remember
My friend said Carmelo Anthony was better than Lebron James in 2014
"Yeah they dropped all the way from 57-25 to 55-27 and he led the team in points, rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals, a feat only matched by Dave Cowens, Kevin Garnett, LeBron James, and Giannis Antetokounmpo."
Yeah you missed the facts Chicago sits against one of the Great Lakes they need to be on this list.   Bulls  Bucks  Pistons  Cavs  Raptors    PG Isiah Thomas  SG Michael Jordan  SF LeBron James  PF Chris Bosh  C Kareem Abdul-Jabber
PG - Oscar Robertson (MIL)  SG - Ray Allen (MIL)  SF - LeBron James (CLE)  PF - Giannis Antetokounmpo (MIL)   C - Kareem (MIL)
"If Melo had won, this thread would've been titled ""LeBron James is the the only player in NBA history to win Rookie of the Month in every single month of their rookie season, and NOT win Rookie of the Year.""  They each cleaned up all the rookie of the month awards in their conferences that year."
Carmelo isn't as shocking when you realize the guy that won ROTY that year also won ROTM every month - LeBron James.
Especially since Wade was much better than LeBron in 2011. James was not even in the conversation for FMVP. It was either going to be Dirk or Wade.
"like I get that the center position is devalued in the modern NBA and he really made a joke of himself bouncing around from team to team trying to find a home, but this is still a guy who's a three-time defensive player of the year who was the best player on a team that knocked out a prime LeBron James and went to the Finals against Kobe. I'm at the point now where I could say that he may have underachieved for his career but he's a no doubt Hall of famer"
Lebron james did not do that trivia.
Lebron Timothy James   Would.   Never.
"Most of the current superstars are soft. KD is a mentally weak beta male, James Harden is a flopper, Kawhi load manages for half the season, Anthony Davis would be a Hall of Very Good type player if the NBA hall of fame actually had standards. Giannis is an absolute boss, but he's not a transcendent talent like LeBron, Shaq, Jordan, etc. Luka Doncic is gonna be Bird-lite. Ja is gonna be Westbrick 2.0. Ben Simmons and Embiid are immature, Karl Anthony Towns is a ""looks like Tarzan, plays like Jane"" type of player. Zion is basically Shawn Kemp 2.0"
"I'd say you gotta have a balance and not side with one too hard.   I'm a 90s baby and my opinion is that LeBron James is the **best** basketball player ever - that means most complete skill-set + longevity. Can do everything, pretty good shooter, athleticism/dunking doesn't even need to be mentioned, one of the best passers of all time, defended well when he wanted (i.e. not always), steals, blocks, IQ - you name it, LeBron is basically the best basketball player ever. He's visited 9 freaking finals and claimed 3 of those titles. Add to that - LeBron never had a coach that even sniffs Phil Jackson, he always had the inferior coaching and team management, and his squads were worse than Jordan's IMO, and basketball is a team game.  Michael Jordan is the **greatest** basketball player ever. I think pure basketball skill-wise, he is ever so close to LeBron (probably the 2nd best skilled player of all time), and combine that with his will to win (probably the best ever at this) and having 6 championships from 6 finals visits. The greatest story ever.  I personally weigh a loss at the finals as probably 25% as great as winning a championship (even though technically it is 50%). So Jordan = 4\*6 = 24, LeBron = 1\*6 + 4\*3 = 18. Re-scale that back, and if Jordan is 100%, LeBron is 75%. Pretty close. If you weighed a finals loss as 50% as great as the finals, they would be equal. But I don't think anyone would weigh it like that."

"I think it’s pretty clear that if this was extend to this season Giannis would be the East MVP and LeBron would be the West MVP. That would put LeBron at 12 MVPs.

"You can't directly compare eras in that way.  Unless you truly empathize and put current players in ***their*** shoes, instead of only comparing the trailblazer generation's 2k three point &amp; quickness ratings to today's current players.   Imagine it the other way around.   Imagine Wade in Jerry's era. Without trainers, with a shit diet, cramped flights, with only a pack of cards and cigars to entertain the guys. Imagine Wade getting drafted to Korea or Vietnam before, or during, his playing career. He'd need his Green Book to make sure he could get a night's rest or a meal in some of the cities he would have to visit, so he wouldn't get accosted by the Klan or dirty cops.   Imagine the toll Wade would've had to deal with back then; imagine his children being born in that era! And the effect it would have on him. Imagine his bubbly personality getting ground down by racism and inequality and injury and the struggles of his kids being born in the wrong era. Without therapy or safe schools to out his kids.   Imagine Wade in flat top Converses, without trainers helping him rehab and fix his terrible biometrics... [Wade [literally didn't know how to run correctly when he entered the league](https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/25570/how-lebron-james-and-dwyane-wade-run).  Wade would have been out of the League in 5 years in the 50s, 60s, 70s. Wade's ankles and knees wouldn't have held up at all. He would've been at best the Gale Sayers of basketball in the 50s or 60s or 70s.   Jerry West's peers revere him in a way that Wade's peers do not, look at anything Bill Russell or Wilt (or Elgin) has every said about Jerry. He is held in the highest of esteems by two guys considered top 5 ever. Jerry's peers had no doubt Jerry was the best guard in the league for a decade.   Wade was considered the best SG in the NBA for what, *maybe* 2-3 seasons? Wade's page in the history book does not glow brighter than Jerry's, just because he was born in an era where people could fix his injuries *and the way he even fucking ran incorrectly*.    It's so goofy how people take 2k ratings and old tape and directly compare them to modern day, but never do it the other way around. The foundational groundbreakers get so disrespected based on today's talent evaluation that it's insane. ""Oh Jerry was slow, he wouldnt be special today."" West and Oscar and Russell shouldered an anxiety level that might have broken a lot of current players.   Steph Curry would have been 130 pounds, with paper ankles, hated by dark skinned *and* light skinned people... would have been a complete footnote in Jerry's era. Steph Curry wouldn't even have a Wikipedia page today if he played in the 50s."
"Glad the Firefox version is useful! Only highlighting the full name is just my design choice. There are a couple of reasons. There's the common name problem that you mentioned.  Then there's the problem of deciding who the player is based on a single name. If I find the name 'James' in the text, whose stats should I show when you hover on it? Harden? LeBron? James Jones? The program is probably going to have to make a more complex decision on what stats to load, based on the surrounding text. That kind of decision is much more complicated (and therefore slower), so I decided it was better to avoid completely.  Hope that answers your question and thanks again for trying it out! =]"

"The wizards years definitely don’t bring his career down substantially and it turns out that Lebron James and Michael Jordan’s all time play off offensive ratings are the same as their careers offensive ratings, 116 and 118 respectively. Both much higher than Kobe’s 110 in both his full career and playoffs.   My point still stands. I don’t believe you can take one advanced metric and rank players that are close using it. Even players that aren’t that close can’t be ranked. Hardens offensive rating in his career is way higher than Kobe’s, is that proof that hardens the better player offensively? No, of course not.   I’m not saying you can’t use it at all. I’m just saying, it’s hardly definitive."

"&gt;You've seen one video of Rodman fronting Shaq and thought he locked him down haven't you  Lebron James built his entire ""can shut down 1-5"" reputation by fronting Pau Gasol on a few possessions 9 years ago. Don't watch him try to guard David West though."

"This is seriously getting hilarious but also sad at the same time. What level of education do you have if you don’t mind me asking?   You are somehow still failing to see the point while also bring up entirely new arguments that I have no problem with. And you’re still strawmaning me by implying that my argument is that Lebron James is the better offensive player, which I never said.   The original argument had nothing to do with team efficiency and quality of team mates. If you had brought that up in the original post, i would not have had a problem with it.   For the last time, I am going to repeat myself. My only criticism I have made this entire time of your post is that you cannot simply think about efficiency in terms of shooting efficiency + turnovers. It is ignorant to only add turnovers to the equation but not take into account the fact that Lebron James has more turnovers because he is more of an on ball playmaker who throws more outlet passes, runs the pick and roll etc."
"You’re getting into entirely new arguments which I have no problem with.   Somehow, you still don’t understand that I have no problem with your conclusion. I have not once stated that Lebron is better than Michael Jordan. I have a problem with your original argument.   Your original argument is that Michael Jordan is more efficient than Lebron James because although Lebron James is a more efficient shooter, he turns the ball over more. This is clearly a bad argument because it overlooks the difference in roles that the two play and fails to account for the flip side of the increase in turnovers, namely more good looks for team mates.   You somehow still don’t get this and are completely strawmaning me. You’re implying that I don’t believe Michael Jordan is better, which I never said. I have only been pointing out that your original argument sucks, because it does."
"“Ok so he created the greatest team ever and never lost a series with home court in his entire career, how can I make this a negative” 😂😂  Amazing how the highest payroll in the NBA, Lebron James, and his 2 other all nba teammates were such incredible underdogs!!"
"Michael Jordan in 13 seasons: 1 x Defensive Player of the Year, 10 x All-Defense Team  He also has the 6th most NBA defense awards in the entire NBA history  For reference, LeBron James in 11 seasons: 0 x Defensive Player of the Year, 5 x All-Defense Team"
"Marketing, mostly. MJ consciously sold himself as a psychopathic ultra-competitor, and Kobe had his own take on the same thing. LeBron does have stories about his work ethic out there but he prefers to market himself as more of a socially conscious family man type.  You can see it when comparing current players too. Whenever I hear about James Harden’s work ethic it’s always glowing praise from others about how exceptionally hard he works to improve his game. Is that the rep he has? Lol fuck no, because he doesn’t push those stories. Meanwhile Giannis is super down for being known as a guy that’s pretty much exclusively dedicated to his sport and his family so *his* work ethic gets spoken on constantly in the media.  When you’re a superstar it’s extremely easy to brand yourself a particular way, LeBron just chose a different way than Kobe and MJ."

"Sure, but are we really saying the Lebron James Kyrie Irving led Cavs beating the Warriors is a bigger upset than the Giants beating the Patriots? Going into the season everyone already knew those two teams would be in the finals, the entire season everyone knew they were the two best teams. I understand anything can happen in one game but I still don’t see how anyone could call this series a bigger upset"
&gt;I'd love to see Lebron James playing in front of lots of mannequins in the stands.  Does Miami count?

"Oh I see. Then yeah, if Giannis and Ayton joined, then you guys would be stacked af. The NBA is the cream of the crop in terms of talent: scrubs and third stringers would look like Lebron James playing against non NBA comp. Even G Leaguers are better than 99% of the players average people like us play against."
"I’m assuming you don’t know how usage is calculated because it seems to me that you believe that because Michael Jordan tended to have slightly more usage, then that means he had the ball in his hands more and played on ball more than Lebron. Go read up on it so that you don’t make terrible points.   If MJ runs around and catches the ball, maybe takes a dribble or two and fades, that counts as a possession “used” by Michael Jordan. There’s not much of a chance he’s going to turnover the ball in that scenario, whereas Lebron James takes the ball up the court, looks for passes, dribbles and drives to collapse the defense, only to kick the ball out wildly. His role as a playmaker is bound to generate more turnovers.   I don’t get why you didn’t ask me this question: “which is better? A scorer who scores more points on slightly less efficiency and turns the ball over less, or a playmaker who scores less but more efficiently and generates much more assists but also a few more turnovers.”   Why is it so difficult for you to understand the difference in roles and to account for Lebron a playmaking?"

"I have always been a bit skeptical of how much a hand on the hip would really stop Michael Jordan or LeBron James from blowing by a defender in a 1 on 1 situation. I think there's probably some tangible effect, but I feel like it may be overstated and the hand checking defense is maybe a bit of a buzz word talking point.  I can see it slowing down role players. I can't see it really slowing down those 2 guys. If anyone can pull stats on what percentage of drives resulted in a successful basket in '96 vs '19, that might be what we need to shed some more light on that"
"To be fair, I think that basketball fans are on it. If baseball thinking ran the basketball world then the all-time list would be something like:  1) Kareem Abdul Jabbar  2) Wilt Chamberlain  3) LeBron James  4) Michael Jordan  5) Magic Johnson  6) Karl Malone  7) Tim Duncan  8) Shaq   9) Oscar Robertson    10) John Stockton  Baseball fans don't care about rings, they think that clutch is imaginary, and they largely rank players based on aggregate one-number summaries."

"Some of those games are like 43% shooting. I actually think this is a compliment. This guys holds Jordan at such a high regards that he thinks 43% is a terrible game for him.  Hey why don't you post all the games where Jordan scored under 20 on the playoffs. Then just for comparison post someone else's, maybe like a LeBron james"
"You really need some big men in there. I'd include Wilt and Kareem since they were impossible to defend in the post. Kareem was even respectable for his position at the free throw line. I kind of want to include Maravich because I feel like he would have dominated today. Even during his final, injury filled season, he made something like 10/15 3s. Imagine what Maravich could have done if he had 3 other All-nba level players along side him during the peak of his career.  I know you asked for 5, but I feel like there are 10-12 people who realistically have a very strong argument for top 5:  Michael Jordan Wilt Chamberlain Kareem Abdul Jabbar Kobe Bryant Kevin Durant LeBron James Pete Maravich Stephen Curry Larry Bird Rick Barry George Gervin James Harden  And from the outside looking in would be Jerry West, Julius Irving, Adrian Dantley, Alex English, Benard King, Tracy McGrady, Elgin Baylor, Karl Malone, Jerry West, Carmelo Anthony, and Hakeem Olajuwon.  If I had to pick just 5, I'd personally go with:  Wilt since he was an unstoppable force for the most part.  Jordan because of his ability to attack the basket, his mid-range, and his free throw ability. Kareem because he had an unstoppable move, was good at the line for his position, and was a monster in the post.  Bird because of his all-around offensive game and his ability to burn you from outside and at the line(at an all-time clip given his volume).  Maravich because I think his career was short-changed given the talent around him and the era he played in. I genuinely think he could have been an all-time great instead of a HOFamer who deserved better if his career started in the 2010s. He's probably the weakest player on my list and I wouldn't mind switching him out with 5-7 other players since there's a lot of what-ifs surrounding him.   Kobe because he was basically a notch below Jordan at most things, but made up for it somewhat by being a better shooter from our side. Especially if you take away Jordan's inflated seasons.   I'm not sure if I missed anyone, but I think that covers all players in the general discussion for greatest scorers ever."
"I can't tell if you are aware, but he was literally nicknamed Tragic Johnson early in his [career](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2011/10/19/2499936/lebron-james-magic-johnson-miami-heat)"
"What are you talking about taking action? It’s the NBA putting in the rule, not the NCAA.   Ohio State is doing just fine moving their apparel without Lebron James as a former student. In fact, it was him who pushed for the deal with Ohio State to become the first school to wear his line.   You’re talking about missing out on pennies for a brand like Ohio State. Not even diving into the fact that it’s a football school and always will be."

"It's also a 3 on 1 with LeBron James in his athletic prime trailing, there's really only so much you can do."
"I've mostly only seen farmer and plumber viewpoints held by those who were too young to see or understand basketball prior to LeBron James (2003 or so). On top of that, they generally seem agenda-driven, seeing only what they want to see. They'll find a clip of Michael Jordan weaving around Brad Lohaus then establish the narrative from there.   The bummer is that it interferes with a real debate that could be had regarding the actual positive changes and developments in the game (and by those who play it) over the past couple of decades. Unfortunately for many, I think that debate is a lot more nuanced than they often wish it to be. Every time I hear about folks pointing toward advancements in nutrition, training, and human evolution as though we've moved forward 1,000 years I want to just step up and be like, ""Dudes, 1997 wasn't *that* long ago. Kobe was playing at that point. KG too.""  Listening to people talk about basketball in the 1990's as though it's the 1940's has been an unforeseen turn of events from my side. At first I thought they were all being tongue-in-cheek, and many are, but there's also some woefully misinformed basketball fans out there really don't seem to have a solid grasp on what came before them, though those same folks are often the most confident that they 100 percent already know it all."

"I am an admitted life-long Bulls fan who watched almost every game Michael Jordan ever played, so my opinion that he is the clear GOAT should not be surprising.  I do, however, think it is something somewhat ""intangible"" that ultimately separates the two men.  Though LeBron is physically more gifted than any player I have ever seen, and his competitive nature and fire is up there with every other all time great athlete... except Michael Jordan.  I do not say this as a complement to Michael, necessarily.  I honestly believe Michael Jordan, my favorite player ever, had some pretty clear sociopathic tendencies.  Personality traits that are not healthy, and probably made him a worse human being than LeBron James, also put him in a mental position that is impossible to compete with.  I honestly believe Michael would have killed a man to win a game.  That's not a good thing, but it's also what made him untouchable, as a competitor.  It is also the thing that makes it so hard to describe what he was like to people who didn't watch him play, beyond the very unsatisfying ""you had to be there to see it."""
"All I remember is being in an empty grocery store, telling a couple of my friends how I had a bigger dick than LeBron James. Then, out of nowhere he appears with his back turned to us, but quickly swings around nearly whacking me in the head with his MEGA COCK. Literally woke me up, as I was in complete shock. First time I've ever seen another man's penis in a dream, but at least it was LeHung's."
Never forget LeBron James was afraid to post up JJ Barea
"I won’t say every single one, but the gross majority of that 7% either went straight to the NBA because college wasn’t a rule at the time (LeBron James, Tyson Chandler) OR they chose to play overseas for a year or two before the NBA draft (Brandon Jennings)."
"Every great player is unique. I love LeBron's game for its combination of force and intelligence. I loved Jordan's game for its sheer artistic inevitability.  Both have racked up incredible, but different, stats and records, and it's pretty useless (but fun) to argue about those accomplishments.    That said, Jordan's unquestionably the best.   The reason?  Jordan was simply unstoppable against the best opponents of his era (in the playoffs). LeBron can and has been stopped in the finals more than he hasn't. That's no knock on James, it's just that MJ was on another plane of competitiveness."
"Gianna was only a little younger than Bronny James and Zaire Wade. Imagine an Olympics with Kobe, LeBron and Dwyane cheering on the sidelines together at every Team USA Mens and Womens team. Biggest ratings, and women's game would get a huge boost."

"If people were replying angrily then it would be remembered as one asshole being shouted down not a bunch of Lakers fans defending Artest actions. You are right that controversial statements gets hits, but controversy means there are many on both sides of the discussion. Which implies more than just a few assholes.  If I made a post on reddit right now saying LeBron James is a mediocre basketball player, it wouldn't be considered controversial no matter how many people reply to tell me I am an idiot. It takes a lot more to have a discussion"
I mean i could be black too for all you know. Point is politics is a divisive topic and it might not be for everyone regardless of skin color.   Im totally okay with not wanting to participate in politics. Beimg black doesnt change a thing. Lebron James is black yet hes come out supporting one of the existing avenues of racist slavery in china..
LeBron James
Some of the 2000's teams were pretty sick.      2005-06:   F - Lebron James   F -  Dirk Nowitzki   C - Shaquille O'Neal   G - Kobe Bryant   G - Steve Nash      2002-03   F - Tim Duncan   F - Kevin Garnett   C - Shaquille O'Neal    G - Kobe Bryant   G - Tracy McGrady
On the bench afraid of the spotlight LEBRON JAMES WOULD NEVER
"&amp;#x200B;  * **Michael Jordan** \- A slightly better Kobe Bryant * **Dikembe Mutombo** \- Rudy Gobert * **John Stockton** \- Steve Nash with less shots and more defense. * **Julius Erving** \- A slightly less dominant Jordan if he was a forward. A rich man's Vince Carter with good rebounding. * **Isiah Thomas** \- CP3 with the capability to take over a game on offense like Iverson. * **Patrick Ewing** \- KAT with less range (Ewing consistently hit 15-17ft jumpers, something centers didn't really do back then). * **Shawn Kemp** \- young Blake Griffin with less passing ability. * **David Robinson** \- If DeAndre Ayton reaches his ceiling and/or overachieves with AD-like atheticism. Would put up 27/11/3/2/3 in his prime. * **Clyde Drexler** \- Maybe a taller Dwyane Wade. If Kobe was almost as good as Jordan, then Drexler is almost as good as Wade. * **Gary Payton** \- A taller CP3 on offense w/less shooting ability; Pat Bev on defense. * **Tim Hardaway** \- slightly shorter Baron Davis with Steph Curry-like handles. * **Penny Hardaway** \- If Kobe was 95% of Jordan, then Penny is maybe 90% of Kobe (offensive moves) with Lebron/Ben Simmons' passing ability and court vision. If MJ and Magic had a child, it'd look a lot like Penny. * **Larry Bird** \- If Nikola Jokic was 3"" shorter, had Klay's shooting and Kobe's killer instinct. * **Magic Johnson** \- Probably Lebron if he was a full-time point guard. Or Ben Simmons with a respectable set shot but less defense. * **Scottie Pippen** \- ('15-'16 and '16-'17) version of Kawhi Leonard with better playmaking skills. Paul George with less 3pt ability. * **Grant Hill** \- Lebron James-esque. Not as good a shooter, but can do-it-all like Lebron from the small forward spot. * **Reggie Miller** \- Klay Thompson without defense. * **Larry Johnson** \- Zion Williamson minus 15-20lbs. * **Hakeem Olajuwon** \- If Joel Embiid became the best player in the NBA. Tim Duncan's post moves and defense with Kobe Bryant's footwork."

"So your idea of a carry job is quite possibly the biggest one in NBA history (LeBron in 2018). Got it. I guess you can't please them all folks. I mean, it's entirely subjective, anyway.  That being said, I would consider Kawhi's playoff run last year historical as well. He shit on every team he faced, including your Bucks. While perhaps not a carry job on the same level as LeBron Raymone James, I would still consider it a carry job, nonetheless.    Opinions are like assholes, everyone's got one."

"""Some are saying that aside from LeBron James, Jordan may be the greatest basketball player to ever live"" its exactly here i stopped reading"
I've seen people compare him to Larry Bird. Lebron James isn't a good 3 point shooter but I think many would be surprised James has a better career 3 point % and was also better 3% his sophomore year (and slightly better FT% ass well career and also at same age)

"It's like rich Paul talking about LeBron's groin injury  &gt; We don't give a sh-- what nobody thinks or says,"" Paul said via phone. ""We're going to do what's best for him. The best-case scenario was three weeks, the worst-case was six weeks  Then LeBron come back and says playoff mode is ""activated"" then they go 3-12 over the next 15 including losses to some of the worse teams in the league.  Then after his own agent says that it was a worse case of 6 weeks and they didn't give a shit about anything but LeBron's health and he takes the full 6 weeks we get this gem after the season.   https://www.complex.com/sports/2019/03/physical-therapist-lebron-james-nurse-injury  &gt; he was on the court in 6 weeks, it should have been 6 months  His therapist knows the game. If you don't want to get fired you have to push the agenda. Plenty of players have had the same injury and it's always 3 to 6 weeks. I don't know one player that has missed 6 months with that injury"
"I think on/off is a great stat because you have an intuitive idea of what it's weakness is so you can take it into account more easily than these giant ass random formula stats. In 2017-18 the GSW's had a top 3 bench in the league while the 2018-19 Warriors didn't and KD had to carry the load more scoring more points in fewer minutes. You can argue he added much more value for that team. I like on/off more than these ""advanced stats"" that is a large formula that mixes a bunch of box score metrics and every website has their own version. Just because a bunch of stats have their pluses and minus doesn't mean if you mix them all together their weaknesses and strengths cover for each other. Also I would argue in cases where you are clearly the best player on the team, you have much more consistant results like [Lebron James](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/1785/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) and [Giannis](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/96/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) more of their careers."
"I'm not getting through, maybe we need a demonstration:  &amp;nbsp;  2016 Game 7: Series tied 3-3, LeBron goes 9 for 24 from the field, Kyrie puts up 26/1/6 on 10 for 23 shooting and the Cavs win.  &amp;nbsp;  2007 Game 4: Cavs down 2-1, LeBron goes 8 for 19 from the field, Boobie puts up 21/2/3 on 4 for 7 shooting (86% TS) and the Cavs win.  (notice the tactical omission of LeBron's 48 point Game 5, just like you omitted Jordan's 54 point Game 4)  2007 Game 6: Pistons down 3-2, LeBron goes 3 for 11 from the field, Boobie puts up 31/2/6 on 7 for 9 shooting (99% TS) and the Cavs win.  Boobie Gibson dragged the 07 Cavs to the Finals, not LeBron James.  &amp;nbsp;  2013 Game 2: Heat down 0-1, LeBron goes 7 for 17 from the field, Chalmers puts up 19/2/4 on 6 for 12 shooting (67% TS) and the Heat win.  2013 Game 6: Heat down 2-3, LeBron goes 11 for 26 from the field, Chalmers puts up 20/2/4 on 7 for 11 shooting (84% TS), the Heat win in OT after Ray Allen's 3 coming off an offensive rebound from LeBron's miss.  Spurs had the series in their hands and let it slip. Chalmers was robbed of Finals MVP.  &amp;nbsp;  2012 Game 2: Celtics down 0-1, LeBron goes 7 for 20 from the field, Wade puts up 23/4/6 on 8 for 15 shooting and the Heat win in OT.  (notice the tactical omission of LeBron's 45 point Game 6)  2012 Game 7: Series tied 3-3, LeBron goes 9 for 21 from the field, Wade puts up 23/6/6 on 8 for 17 shooting and the Heat win.

"LeBron was hurt, before that the Lakers were one of the best teams in the league while James averaged 28.   Single handley?   AD without LeBron on this Lakers team would not be nearly as successful. And the Lakers added a ton of talent this year to go along with LeBron and AD.   I'm not a LeBron fan, you can read my other posts in regards to the last dance and how it's not even a debate who the GOAT is it's MJ.   But you're wrong on this take."
"So Anthony Davis is better than LeBron James? Blasphemy.  You could also attribute that to LeBron being a good teammate! Passing the ball more rather than being the go to scorer, which is what made Magic Johnson the best PG of all time.   AD is a great player but like a lot of other young stars he needs to prove it in the post season and make it to the finals to earn more respect that he is certainly due"
You keep speaking of leading a good offense but CP3 has the highest offensive net rating of all time.   Also mix in the fact that he led the league in offensive win shares 3x and finished 2nd to a guy name LeBron James 2x (in his prime). He'd have more if not for the injuries. Often times he did not play in an offensively genius system like Dantonis when he did this either.

"Didn’t he say this years later? What he actually said after that championship:  &gt; “My motivation,” James says, “is this ghost I’m chasing. The ghost played in Chicago.”  https://www.si.com/nba/2016/08/02/lebron-james-michael-jordan-ghost-cleveland-cavaliers-championship   So yeah, this is him admitting he was still chasing MJ, the goat. No player in the history of the NBA has controlled the PR and image around him as strongly as Lebron has."

"&gt;  top 3 defense 3 years in a row  they were. Iggy is really really good and he's been really really good for years. Defending Lebron James to win Finals MVP. Draymond green is ""short"" yet has to defend against 7' centers (with / without Bogut). It's not lost on me.   None of them would start on the 2004 Pistons. Maybe one of them would start on the 96 bulls over harper or longley.   &gt;Combine those two things, I really don't see how anyone else has a chance  But the bulls aren't deaf.

"So a person who played under tougher rules who at one point averaged 50 pts for a season he wouldn’t be able to score more? Who else averaged close to 59 a game? Who is going to break his rebounds in a game record?  You think Dan Marino wouldn’t have thrown for more yards if he were in a pass happy league? Think about it, he did it way before Drew Brees(5k passing yards)and the rules weren’t favorable to him.  I started watching late 80’s/90’s basketball and football. I saw then get softer over time. I watched players get less physical to match the rules.  Do I agree EVERYONE from then would dominate no, NO  Do I believe the most dominant player of that era can compete in any era yes.  Could Lebron transcend eras yes James Harden no Could you imagine steph or kd in the 60’s? I can’t...  Basketball started before Kobe Ijs"
"I mean actively criticizing the most powerful player in the league is never a good idea for another players career (just look at the time Lebron tried to claim Phil Jackson was racist bc he talked about the power Lebron and his posse have) but there are certainly a few examples you could point to.  \- Lebron subtweeting Kevin Love [https://cavaliersnation.com/2019/12/18/kevin-love-says-lebron-james-cryptic-tweets-were-passive-aggressive-and-silly/](https://cavaliersnation.com/2019/12/18/kevin-love-says-lebron-james-cryptic-tweets-were-passive-aggressive-and-silly/)  \- Making it publicly known that he wants the Lakers to trade for AD. Chants of 'Lebrons going to trade you' during the Pacers game, then when they were losing at the end of the game Lebron sat as far away from the team as possible. That off season they trade away most guys on the other side of the bench and fire the head coach.

"I can't stand LeBron or KD. But I think we can all agree that KD going to the Warriors was one of the most ridiculous things to happen in any major sport.  The Warriors **were** 73-9 good because, well, they literally were 73-9...  The Warriors lost in Game 7 to a LeBron James team (considered by many to be the second-best player of all time) and the Warriors won the championship the year before.  I'd say Kevin Durant, easily a top 2-3 player in the league at the time, joining a team that won a championship followed by going 73-9 the next season only to lose in Game 7 of the Finals against LeBron, the second-best player in history, is very similar to someone of Shaq's caliber joining the 72-10 Bulls.   For goodness sake, the Warriors were one game away from winning back-to-back championships while setting the all-time regular season wins record. I don't know why I even have to defend this."
It would LeBron James and Patrick Mahomes masturbating for an hour
"If bill simmons texted lebron james for commemt, lebrln would tell bill to f off too"
"And out of the players on that list, Dr J is probably the most mentioned, but I still feel that he is underrated because his ABA accomplishments are often forgotten. He actually has the same amount of rings and MVPs as Lebron James and most people don't know this"
As a human being I would much rather lebron James methods than mj's. I'm not following or being nice to somebody who punches me in the face
"He was, then LeBron won In 16 and snatched it back.  Then with kd joining the warriors they turned LeBron fucking James into an underdog."
"Unpopular opinion: I have him as the 3rd best player all-time. I get that his metrics and stats aren't up to par with the other legends.  But just watch his game on film and compare it to the other legends. Had amazing insticts with his back to the basket, could hit nearly any shot at any tough angle, had an amazing handle, could play and score without the basketball, had all time great footwork, was the league's best perimeter defender at his peak, etc.   He faced the toughest playoff competition of any legend, in my opinion. He faced more 60+ win teams, faced more 50+ win teams, and he faced fewer teams that had less than 50 wins compared to other greats such as Kareem  Abdul-Jabbar, LeBron James, and Michael Jordan. He even faced more players that made an All-NBA teams and as well as facing more MVP winners compared to those players.   Yet he still won 5 championships, made the finals 7 times, never once lost in the WCF, and was only eliminated in the first round twice. And for the record, I had Kobe around this range before his passing, so this isn't a sympathy nod."
LeBron James with no regard for human life was pretty epic
"No, what’s a giant cop out is Lebron James who preaches to the American public how to act and how to behave and how to vote, but then openly supports a regime that’s committing the worst human rights violations since the Third Reich. That’s a cop out. MJ stayed quiet, and apparently him staying quiet is worse than the people who shill and throw their full fledge support to a murderous government who in 2020 is solely responsible for a catastrophic worldwide crisis..."
LeBron James is a 1? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"[This link](https://hoopshype.com/2018/12/31/nba-aging-curve-father-time-prime-lebron-james-decline/) shows the average age of All-NBA selections over time, which peaked in 96-98, so I think Kobe has a point here. No offense but Tom Gugliotta and Chris Gatling being one-time All-Star selections is a terrible indicator of who was dominating the league at the time.  Also what Kobe may be referring to is just the overall demographic of the league, not necessarily who was dominating it. It feels like teams nowadays are more willing to take flyers on under-25 guys that have athletic potential, whereas teams in the 90's were more inclined to fill out rosters with older, solid vets."
"""LeBron James with no regard for human life."""
"no they aren't. Wade played alongside a primary ball handler his entire career (Jason Williams, Gary Payton, Mario Chalmers, LeBron James)  West was a combo guard, you could argue he's a one, but he wasn't a PG like Cousy/Robertson or other true PGs of the era.   Allen Iverson was 100% a SG. An undersized one, but he still always played with a PG. Eric Snow, Andre Miller to name a few. He played some point here and there but he succeeded as a SG. It's like calling Dirk a Center because he played C a few years.   Gervin was a 2, he played the majority of his NBA career with Mike Mitchell a 6'7 small forward while in San Antonio."
I know Elgin Baylor gets compared to Lebron James a lot but this post is about Michael Jordan and not Kobe Bryant.
"top 6-7 behind  lebron, giannis, kawhi, healthy kd, james harden, steph curry and everyone else is arguable"
"To be fair as far as All-NBA goes, it's tough when you come up at the same time as LeBron James, and then you got Kevin Durant just a few years behind that. Early on you had guys like Duncan, Dirk and Garnett around. Forward was a competitive spot for Melo's entire career."
LeBron James would be Obiwan since he knows the power of the high ground
"I disagree, you can have a bad game with good stats. I.e Lebron first year with the Lakers.  Fun fact James Harden once scored 27 points while only making 2 field goals."
"Obviously losing the finals isn’t as good as winning the finals. But you’ve also repeatedly argued against the fact that getting to the finals is better than not getting to the finals, and also suggested multiple times that Lebron James isn’t great. I’m not even sure how to deal with claims like that which is why I’ve given up logic with you lol"
"More than dumb IMO. It shows just how money hungry Lebron is and every move is calculated to maximize exposure and thus earnings. You're Lebron fucking James, you don't need to do anything else to earn money, your name speaks for itself."
"Number of Finals series with an All-NBA or All-Defensive teammate:  Kobe: 5x All-NBA, 3x All-Defensive (out of 7)  Michael Jordan: 5x All-NBA, 6x All-Defensive (out of 6)  LeBron James: 4x All-NBA, 0x All-Defensive (out of 9)  Number of Finals series played against a team with 2+ All-NBA players:  Kobe: 1x (08 Celtics)  MJ: 3x   LeBron: 6x"
"Sorry to belabor the point, but are you suggesting speaking out against racism is related to morality and a person's moral code?   also, perplexed by the argument - no, i don't think people expect other people to share their perspective on everything, but i do think we choose our company based on whether people at least have some threshold amount of commonality.  for example, i don't think i would like Lebron James if he came out and was like ""Sexism and racism are good things for society."" i also don't think i'd personally like Lebron as much if he was also indifferent to those problems because those issues mean something to me. it wouldn't mean he's any worse of a person (in the indifference scenario), but I have every right to decide to put my energy into supporting another athlete that may have more in common with myself."
"i am not saying it is better. i am saying that one argument for james is that he is always the main reason his team won a title. imagine if lebron was ever the 2nd best player on his team the way that some of these players have been while winning a title. this was the year where some people argued that AD could be the first guy. of course duncan's championship resume is better than james, thankfully."
"Yh, I'm sure no Lebron James and Steph Curry have no clue who reigning DPOY Rudy Gobert is"
"LeBron, Wade, Bosh, Carmelo, with strong role-players like Korver, Hinrich, Perkins, Collison, West, Pavolvic, Diaw, Pachulia, Blake, Bonner, and legend James Jones?   Still need a few years to percolate before I'm okay with that comparison either."
Well that's a fancy way of saying who is the most popular player is  and that's LeBron James. If you are asking who sells the most tickets again LeBron James. He rarely plays in front of a crowd that's not a sell out. Opposing teams arenas sell out when he plays. He is the biggest draw in sports.
Why do you say so?  In G1 Cavs scored 31pts off the Curry-James switches. Hunting mismatches is a staple of LeBron led offenses.
"This relationship, and its codification by the league, has been a gradual evolution from Jordan’s early playing days. “I think it developed over time,” LL Cool J said. “Obviously, you have to be successful enough to come to the attention of people.”  Older basketball fans may recall “Come Fly With Me,” a 1989 documentary released by N.B.A. Entertainment that followed Jordan’s career from his childhood to the league, and features some of the same archival footage found in “The Last Dance.” The film’s soundtrack, however, is almost exclusively music by smooth jazz artists such as Yanni, Najee and David Benoit. “N.B.A. Superstars,” a 1990 VHS release that set highlights of then-active stars to popular music, syncs a montage of Jordan soaring through the air to Berlin’s [“Take My Breath Away,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx51eegLTY8) primarily known as the ballad from “Top Gun.” (Try to imagine a licensed N.B.A. documentary setting LeBron James highlights to something like Adele’s “Someone Like You.”)  There are some throughlines linking past and present: The sole rap song on “N.B.A. Superstars” is Kool Moe Dee’s [“How Ya Like Me Now,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_nAZ3VEA0) which scores a piece about the Houston Rockets star Hakeem Olajuwon. “It was a perfect match of lyrics and music for Hakeem, who really was totally coming into his own in the N.B.A.,” said Gil Kerr, who helped oversee the production of “Come Fly With Me” and “N.B.A. Superstars.” “How Ya Like Me Now” is used to roughly the same effect in Episode 4 of “The Last Dance,” where it accompanies a celebratory sequence after Jordan’s first playoff triumph over the hated Detroit Pistons. The team is briefly seen watching a lighthearted video from 1988, where several players — including Jordan — danced and lip-synced to Kool Moe Dee’s hit.  The “How Ya Like Me Now” we hear in “The Last Dance” is actually not the 1987 original, but a rerecorded take that removes an impossible-to-clear James Brown sample. Speaking over the phone, Kool Moe Dee said the producers had incorporated “the wrong version.” Still, he thought they had done “a very good job in terms of using hip-hop music as a storytelling mechanism.” He noted the contrast between today and the late ’80s, when he stood relatively alone as a mainstream hip-hop artist. “I was absolutely the guy that when people didn’t like hip-hop, they’d always say, ‘I don’t like hip-hop but I like Kool Moe Dee*.’*”  Today, it’s difficult to imagine the N.B.A. without hip-hop. Roddy Ricch’s “The Box,” which topped the Billboard singles chart for several weeks this year, [references an iconic Vince Carter dunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8BSSCnSYds). Drake is the designated “global ambassador” of the Toronto Raptors, and a [frequent courtside presence](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/sports/drake-toronto-raptors.html). (During the 2019 N.B.A. playoffs, [he was unofficially reprimanded](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2019/05/29/nba-speaks-raptors-drake-courtside-behavior/1280407001/) by the league for trash-talking Toronto’s opponents.) [Roc Nation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/style/jay-z-super-bowl-roc-nation.html), an entertainment agency founded by Jay-Z, represents multiple players, including the superstars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving of the Brooklyn Nets.  “I think the popularity of basketball as a cultural sport — not just as an athletic sport — is a testament to that connection,” LL Cool J said.  The N.B.A.’s growing comfort with rap music mirrored rap’s own absorption into — and later domination of — mainstream culture, where by the turn of the millennium, it wasn’t just the players who were devoted listeners. “The executives behind it are growing up with hip-hop,” Kool Moe Dee said of the league. “They’re way more comfortable making those kinds of choices. It’s very hard to understate the racial tones that go on in every aspect of business in America.”  Balancing those demands remains an ongoing process. In 2005, the league instituted [a dress code](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-sports/how-david-sterns-nba-dress-code-changed-mens-fashion-104719/) that some [saw as targeting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/22/AR2005102201386.html) the influence of hip-hop style on players. “The Last Dance” was jointly produced by multiple companies, and Hehir said “there were certain partners who thought there was too much hip-hop in this.”  Judging by the final product, he prevailed, and the predominance of rap in the series further revises not just the N.B.A.’s legacy with the music now inseparable from its culture, but Jordan’s personal relationship with the genre, as well.  In 1997, just before the events of “The Last Dance” took place, the hip-hop journalist [Bobbito Garcia interviewed Jordan](https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=bobbito&amp;f=false) for a recurring feature in Vibe magazine where he played music for celebrities and asked their opinion. One of his selections was Eric B. and Rakim’s [“In the Ghetto,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEgKRuA_eSw) from the duo’s 1990 album “Let the Rhythm Hit ’Em.” Jordan’s response? “You got me on this one. I don’t listen to rap at all.”  Garcia, who called the interaction “my most memorable exchange” (it seems to go [viral on social media](https://twitter.com/redapples/status/1027210149407215616) every few years) said in an interview that he wasn’t surprised that Jordan didn’t listen to rap: He was born in 1963, which would’ve made him a young adult when hip-hop was just taking off. By comparison, today’s players have never known a world where rap music wasn’t fully integrated into pop culture. Still, “The fact that he had never heard of Rakim, I just thought that was surprising,” Garcia said. “I would’ve imagined that at some point he was at a party that was playing ‘Paid in Full,’ or one of his teammates was nodding along to the chorus at some point in the locker room.”  Then again, Garcia noted Jordan was a single-minded winner, “So it’s highly believable he didn’t pay any attention to anything but his stats and his win-loss column and winning a championship.” Hehir, for his part, said Jordan, who offered feedback on the documentary, “never commented on the music.”"

Is this like for Lebron James when he is on the road
"LeBron ""more than an athlete"" James?"
Wilt deserves #2 out of sheer dominance that will never be seen again.   Kobe vs James is a debate that can swing either way. I'd take Kobe over Lebron.
Lol you clowns comparing Jordan and James when it comes to politics. Jordan never fronted and lebron is a two faced puss
Easy LeBron James on that question
Triv........LEBRON JAMES
"Hey buddy, I don’t have the same platform as LEBRON JAMES. Sorry that I can’t do more. Me telling people that Uyghurs are being exterminated has already done 10x more than what Lebron has done by not addressing the China concern"
Here’s one link https://www.chartattack.com/lebron-james-sofia-jamora-cheating/
"Fun fact: Since 2011 Derrick Rose is the only first team all NBA player Lebron James faced in the playoffs in the Eastern Conference. For comparison, Damian Lillard *in the 2019 playoffs alone* face three players (Paul George, Nikola Jokic, Stephen Curry) in the Western Conference.   I think there's a debate to be had about who really had the easiest road."
"That season, Rose scored 2000 points and tallied 600 assists.  To that point, only five people in history had ever done that, Oscar Roberson, Michael Jordan, Tiny Archibald, LeBron James and John Havlicek.  They are all Hall of Famers."
"Fake news...  During his insane 8 year stretch LeBron knocked out these hall of fame candidates that were either current all-stars at the time of the series or the very next season:  2011: Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo, Derrick Rose  2012: Carmelo Anthony, Amare Stoudemire, Tyson Chandler, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, James Harden  2013: Joakim Noah, Paul George, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker  2014: Kemba Walker, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Deron Williams, Paul George  2015: Joakim Noah, Jimmy Butler, Pau Gasol, Paul Millsap, Al Horford  2016: Paul Millsap, Al Horford, Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, Steoh Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green  2017: Paul George, Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan  2018: Paul George, Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, Jayson Tatum"
"There is no power without weight. Think of your typical ""strong"" wings. Kawhi 230 lbs, Butler 230 lbs, Melo 240, lbs, LeBron 250 lbs. Draymond green 230 lbs Jaylen Brown 223 lbs. Heck even James harden is a decent 220.  Kobe is 212 and Jordan was 195 (he bulked up later, but never that much)."
"As you said in the title, some people might put him *close* but no one puts him above Kobe. So Kobe having better stats is irrelevant. Kobe is in some people's top 10 because of his whole career not only the years you mentioned. So if he retired today KD wouldn't crack it but he has a lot of time left.  That being said, to answer your question, people are dumb and/or hate Kobe. Here is one redditor's top 10 players of all time from a recent thread:     1. Kareem 2. Robertson 3. Jordan 4. Duncan 5. Wilt 6. Ray Allen 7. James Harden 8. LeBron James 9. Steve Nash 10. Steph Curry  Yikes."
LeBron James would be an incredibly rich man's JR Smith
"&gt; Yes, but the whole argument was whether or not James Harden is a below average 3 point shooter, not whether or not he is a great player on the level of LeBron or Curry.  Yes I know you've moved the goal posts to try and rationalize his sub-par shooting % and I took the bait.  &gt; Harden's a choker, he's had plenty of opportunities in the playoffs and always comes up short.  It's not about him choking, he's put up great numbers in the playoffs. It's about a system (one man offense) designed to fail under the weight of a long playoff run. But now we are really off topic.   &gt; But he's definitely not a below average 3 point shooter.  This year he was, over his career he's right smack in the middle. Average, at best. Like I said. You can call the data fake news or say that because he has terrible shot selection we should for some reason give him a break on total %'s (lol) - i'm not inclined to buy either justification.   People see him hitting 3's all day in highlights and see him maybe breaking the single season record and think ""he's a good shooter"". Nope, he had to shoot almost 200 more 3's to keep pace with Steph Curry's 400 in a season. That doesn't make him good, that makes him a shameless chucker."
"Yes, but the whole argument was whether or not James Harden is a below average 3 point shooter, not whether or not he is a great player on the level of LeBron or Curry. Harden's a choker, he's had plenty of opportunities in the playoffs and always comes up short. But he's definitely not a below average 3 point shooter."

"Some players are playing for their legacy.. Lebron James for example.   This year might be his last good chance of winning a ring (who knows what will happen next year)  Of course it doesn’t matter for some other players, especially the guys out of the playoff race/non-contenders"
Micheal Jordan: 6 finals MVPs  Tim Duncan: 2 finals MVPs  Kobe Bryant: 2 finals MVPs  Stephen Curry: ZEROOO finals MVPs  Shaq: 3 finals MVPs  Magic Johnson: 3 finals MVPs  Lebron James: 3 finals MVPs
"From 2010-2020 James Harden has more FT makes than the next highest person(Lebron) has FT attempts. He will most likely go down in history as the most prolific flopper to ever play the game. I wish he could understand just how badly his legacy will be affected, it's clear he care's(even if it's a small amount)"
"As good as Lebron James is, the recency bias and the constant media bombardment is the thing that push him into the Goat debate.  There are at least 5-10 people with similar success and althrough Lebron has been the best player in the past 10 years - he was mostly dominant in the East with the only top Tier teams being Boston(their core being 33+ years old) and Chicago whom quickly faded away after Rose felt down. Challenges is what crown the absolute best players not PPG and %'s."
"Pay attention. There's a lot of details in between the lines of real life.  why does lebron get so much praise? 2015 finals baby faced steph, peach fuzz klay, and dark skinned draymond beat LeBron without klove and kyrie in 6 GAMES. 2016 finals a year AFTER growth again--same core--and this time lebron gets klove and kyrie. YET THEY WERE STILL SPANKING THAT ASS. LeBron then bitches to Silver to get the upperhand and STILL it goes to the final minute of game 7 with a shot from kyrie. You're telling me that only ONE year later steph, klay, and dray became so fucking good that they took Lebron (the supposed second best most complete basketball player of all time apparently) with kyrie and klove (who bron didnt have the year before) to the last fucking minute of a game 7--only one game extra from the previous year? KD or no KD, the fucking path those three were on in their growth is ridiculous so go from 6 games against bron no kyrie no klove to 7 games against bron, kyrie, and klove. You honestly think KD is the difference between Lebron being sent to game 7 with the team he built himself and LeBron getting gentlemans swept and then swept the following years?   Lebron by himself against steph klay and draymond loses in 6 games. cavs with lebron kyrie and klove go on to win in 7 games the next year with outside help from the commissioner. How is he that good if the next year after losing he's pushed to game 7 with the same teammates that were said if they were there it would've been a cakewalk for Lebron. year after that, Lebron with the best team he's ever been on, sweeps every team, and then himself gets gentlemans swept with a gutted warriors roster that kept steph dray and klay and got KD. the growth trajectory those boys were on is something else man. KD is not the difference between lebron going to game 7 final minute and only winning one game. he had kyrie and klove man. NEXT year, loses Kyrie, and gets swept by again another gutted warriors roster. Steph has been better than Lebron since 2015 🤷🏽‍♂️ idc about all the things lebron can do when it's clearly proven whatever steph can do is better than lebron's efforts results wise.    if you look at 2016's stats, you'll see that the HERCULEAN efforts by lebron james and kyrie irving all the way up to the final minute of game 7 isn't what won them that series. Look at the stats and you'll see Harrison Barnes LOST gsw that series. literally the kid has to make one open three and the warriors win that series. If harrison was ray allen that'd be a two peat right there. Or you could just upgrade barnes to kevin durant and go on to win two more 🤷🏽‍♂️   so isn't that crazy? the warriors were so much more dominant and so much more a better team than the cavs in 2016 (before Kevin Durant) that it took all low lights from Harrison Barnes for 335 minutes to even give the cavs a shot, which Kyrie capitalized on.    and let's not forget the league fucked around trying to extend the series and that cost gsw the title and that's that.   what business doesn't want to generate more money, especially when you can do so artificially? let's not act like iust because it wasnt blown up in the media doesn't mean that conversation to extend the series to game 7 when the opportunity arose didn't happen because it obviously did   like the NBA cares about honor in sports or any of that sportsmanship and honor bullshit. it's a business hungry for more and more profit. more games = more profit. more games on the biggest stage = more profit. the league gifted Lebron that championship and it's not fair and he's not deserving. how tf do you then go to two more consecutive finals and win only 1 game between those next two finals? Only Lebron's ass gets kissed for doing so and it doesn't make any sense to me how this man doesn't produce what's been promised of his status as ""best in the world"""
Lakers rebuilt an entire team around Kobe. LeBron team hopes to play with the best.   Wade is one other the greatest shooting guards to ever play. He is is the discussion all time top Five. Ray Allen is the second leading 3 point shooter is the history of the game. Chris Bosh and Gasol were comparable. LeBron left the Cavs and went to play with some of the greatest players ever.   Back in Cleveland LeBron played with Irving who was arguably the second best point guard in the league and Kevin Love who is also good as Gasol. Now on the Lakers James has Davis who in the top Center on the league without question.   Kobe had Gasol and Bynum. Gasol was top 5 but definitely not top three at the time and Bynum was a guy who looked good in the system the ultimately only had 3 decent seasons in his whole career and was injury prone even at his peak.

Lebron James.  /s
"Only LeBron James is held to such a ridiculously unattainable standard, in and out of basketball. Who else would get compared to Ali in terms of activism....It just illustrates his fucking greatness that people constantly wanna say shit like this, “hell never be Jordan” you might as well say “well Lebron could never navigate the world through crisis like Roosevelt” I stg ppl like me who eat brons ass exist because of ppl like Rob Parker not the other way around"
"From the 2010s guys I think the final resting places will be:  1. Lebron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Chris Paul  Where that puts him all time? Probably ends up Top 15, given people have Durant ranked 14th right now.   I’m assuming he wins at least 1 championship for the Clippers in this. If he fails at that, he will be ranked below Durant and be in the 18-25 range."
I said giannis might be better than him and Lebron james is
"“Subjective BS Like All-Around Game”  Your argument could be supported a bit more. In my opinion LeBron James is one of the best all-around players because of his ability to score, playmake,  and defend at all high levels. Specifically his scoring and playmaking are on elite levels. Being compared to Magic, LeBron is a better scorer because of his driving and overall shooting ability.  Being compared to Scottie, LeBron is a better scorer and playmaker. I don’t know if “Subjective” would be the right word to describe people’s arguments about LeBron being the best all-around as there is not many things that he can’t do."
Has to go way beyond that. It’s def shtick but I do believe a part of him is in love with Lebron James.
Lebron “I dont flop” james.
"It's a stupid comparison.    Lebron James didn't have to face Vietnam, Jim Crow laws, insane levels of riots/protests, political assassinations, etc.  Of course, he's not going to come as close to Ali.  The environment is way different today than it was in Ali's time and that's a good thing.  That said, Lebron can at least stand for freedom of speech next time China comes knocking around.  Hong Kong isn't the US so he shouldn't have to feel the need to speak of another nation if he doesn't want to but when that other nation is threatening your rights, you better stand up."
"Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere, Our Lives Begin To End The Day We Become Silent About Things That Matter - Lebron James"
KD and Steph will probably make their way in here but for the sake of their careers not being over I leave them out  1. Michael Jordan 2. Lebron James 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabarr  4. Larry Bird 5. Magic Johnson 6. Bill Russell 7. Wilt Chamberlain 8. Tim Duncan 9. Hakeem Olajuwan 10. Shaquille O’Neal 11. Kobe Bryant 12. Moses Malone 13. Karl Malone 14. Chuck Barkley 15. Jerry West 16. Julius Erving 17. Dirk Nowitzki 18. Oscar Robertson 19. Kevin Garnett  20. Dwyane Wade
Yes it was James Jones that took LeBron to those consecutive championships =p
Nah nah LeBron has benefited from playing with James Jones the most. Hasn't been able to win a ring without him

"Pt2/3    **NUMBERS**       There is a whole host of ways that the way science asks someone to treat data conflicts with the current NBA discourse, but data treatment has to be biggest one.      For instance, I have already mentioned the problem with controlling for the environments and how each person has different contexts, but that gets exponentially exacerbated by the problem that no *2 seasons* are identical either.      Take the 2018 and 2019 rockets, 2 teams with roughly the same core, and in the simplified discourse version of events, the same 2 stars both years. But no one would say those teams were the same quality, and its why the “well the year after when the warriors were missing KD the rockets still lost” argument has no bearing on the 2018 what if (Fun aside, the fact that this huge what if exists, again shows how stupid it is to pretend that playoff success is a *good* metric).      But this means that we are intentionally restricting our samples to the *their absolute* *smallest possible.* That is, Chris Paul has **thousands of minutes** and hundreds of games where he thoroughly outplayed Billups. To weight the seven games Billups played really well against the 4 games that everyone brings up in regard to “CP3 the choker” in comparison as a means of elevating Billups over Paul is to purposefully restrict and curate your data.      This is the BIGGEST no-no in science. To selectively curate and restrict data to fit the narrative and model you want (that better players win rings) is completely backward (I will circle back to this), but not only that it makes the analysis meaningless. Everything we know about data treatment is that you use the most expansive sample with the most normalized contexts possible. To use single playoff series, is to take the 90 game sample of the year and restrict it to 10-15.     It’s like if you were doing an experiment with mouse embryos again, and you need 3 different litters to replicate your experiment with sufficient numbers, but then for the third one you decide to draw a gold ring around this petri dish and treat its data as special. That selective weighting and curation of the data would get your paper rejected and laughed at by your peers.      It also then contains systemic biases from facing matchups exclusively, as opposed to a sampling of the league. A bad match up like Orlando against the Cavs in 2009 can confuse the results, when for instance that Cavs team probably would probably have beaten any other team in the east and their play style on defense was not suited to stretch system based around Dwight. They also did not have a secondary playmaker to take pressure off Lebron\*.      \*As an aside, tell me what lebron was doing wrong as a player in that series to lose in the second round. If that is the play of a player who loses in the second round, then maybe losing in the second round is not a meaningful distinction. He played a near-flawless series.      Using playoff series also tends to confuse probabilities with inevitabilities. For instance, that the clippers were always going to lose in 2015 to the rockets. When in actually, Josh smith and Brewer canning threes is a highly unlikely event and if that series gets played 10 times (let alone if CP3 was healthy and played all 6 games) the clippers probably win 5-6 of them.      The warriors Rockets series is the best example: Everyone brings up the infamous hamstring as a what if since the rockets would have won. But even then, the truth is the rockets were on one of the paths represented by 40-45% chance they had to win this series. The series was not destined to be 3-2 after 5 and if you re-do the series giving CP3 full health it could be 2-3; 4-1; or even 1-4 as a totally different series.       Put another way, Lebron was pretty much the same player in 2013 and 2014 despite having diametrically opposed results. In fact, he is the **EXACT** same player he is rightfully hailed as in 2013, even if he loses the title because Ray Allen misses. That is because all he can do is put his team in a general position to succeed, from there it’s dependent on exigent factors and stochastic luck.      And finally as I alluded to before, Lebron James, the 2nd best of all time has only won 3 titles in his 15 years of prime. Most inner circle hall of fames are between 2-5 out of 15-20 prime seasons. When you consider that there have been “modern” players for near 50 years and about 10-5 franchise players per decade. It would be no surprise to find that out of the 50-75 best players, that many will be at 0/15;0/20 just from random chance along a normal distribution. This would mean that equivalent players are still subject to random distributions in outcome. Everything we know about experimental data and reality suggests this is trivially true. Thus if Great players can go ringless from random chance, you should not place significance on the absence of rings when judging player."
"To the extent that people consider Draymond Green to be ""way better"" than Kevin Love, I think a lot of it has to do with narrative.  Draymond was a central piece to the revolutionary Warriors teams. His defensive versatility and offensive play-making were critical to the Warriors dynasty. Green changed how the tweener is perceived and created a new NBA archetype - a defensive player that can guard 5 positions and handle ball-handling and play-making duties.  On the other hand, Kevin Love got traded to the Cavs, and while he played an essential role in the 2016 team, Love largely played the same role as Chandler Frye - a stretch 4/5. Most of what made him unique in Minnesota - his ability to generate offense from the high post with the combination of his size, shooting and passing - overlapped positionally with Lebron James. And, since Lebron just flat out did that part better, Love was relegated to corner 3s and the odd post ups here and there.  Love was overqualified for his role. Draymond out-played his size, draft position and the tweener stigma, helping to usher in the age of position-less basketball. That context matters. And when you're a central piece to a game changing dynasty, you punch your ticket to the Hall.  As for whether or not Draymond is actually better than Kevin Love? I think it falls on need. Draymond doesn't have the offensive skill set to generate offense has the lead guy. We KNOW Kevin Love could do that. Neither could be the best player on a contender. That said, if prime Kevin Love is your best player, you're probably in a better situation than having Draymond as your best player. As your third guy though? Draymond checks off more boxes without needing the ball as much."

Blocks numbers are so strange in international play during the Dream Team Era due to the minutes distribution and change in style of play (international teams not challenging people like David Robinson in the paint as frequently... or turning the ball over before they could even get there).   An extension of your trivia factoid - here's each Dream Team's blocks leader:  1992 - Patrick Ewing (1.1) (followed by Chris Mullin at 1.0)  1996: John Stockton (0.5)  2000: Ray Allen (1.4)   2004: Carmelo Anthony (0.7 in a touch under 7 minutes per game)  2008: LeBron James (1.0)  2012: Kevin Durant (0.6)  2016: DeAndre Jordan (1.1)  2020: COVID-19 (1.0)
The James to LeBron is the Michael to Jordan.
Delonte West to Lebron is the James Jordan Sr. to Jordan
Oh cmon. The only reason they didnt win immediately is because of lebron collosal choke.  If lebrom doesnt choke they win immediately. And they win 3 straight. You can try revisionist history about how Lebron James and Wade and Bosh joining together wasnt actually a good team. But the truth is a they wouldve won more championships than the Warriors had Lebron not having the biggest choke of all time.

"but this isn't circumventing the cap. spencer dinwiddie is asking non-nba private citizens to essentially give him money for nothing except that they think it would be fun to pick his team.  if a max player negotiates a shoe deal to give him 20% extra if he goes to LA or NY and then he goes to LA or NY for less money than his max, that isn't circumventing the cap.   even without such a clause, it's not really any different than a player playing where he wants for less because his shoe deal dwarfs his nba money and he doesn't need to play for the most money possible.  this rule wouldn't preclude players from doing what they want in the non-nba sphere of life.  i don't see how it would even keep lebron from offering dinwiddie his own money to come to LA (since someone mentioned it).  if lebron james thinks a good way to spend $24M is to give it to spencer dinwiddie, then i guess good for him.  it wouldn't be any different than accepting a smaller contract to allow your team to sign other players.  the CBA relationship between lebron and the lakers ends when they pay him.  now if the lakers somehow repay lebron the $24M, we have a problem.  having said all that, the commissioner has pretty broad ""best interests of the game powers"" that seem to allow him to do anything short of public beheadings, so the nba could probably weasel their way out of something like this.  but i imagine the NBAPA would throw a fit and stand a good chance in court if the nba said players couldn't ask for money outside of the nba."
"&gt;Fair, I think if Kawhi can stay good a while longer and wins a few more rings all time they will be more equal  Huh? LeBron James is a 4 time MVP. Only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Michael Jordan have more MVPs than LeBron James at 6 MVPs and 5 MVPs, respectively. Regular season MVPs matter quite a bit when it comes to all-time rankings since that's the highest personal achievement you can get in the NBA. Kawhi Leonard might not even win 1 MVP in his career if he load manages for the rest of his career. I don't think you can be close to LeBron's career with 0 MVPs. I also don't think LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard's NBA careers will be close to equal when all is said and done lol"
Plot twist: it was the King James Bible signed by a young Lebron.
&gt;lmao lets send him to the knicks  Hell nah. I'm not tryna see old man Ray John Ron Doe running the point guard position for my team when LeBron James isn't on the court lol

LeBron Raymone James Sr.
"Leaders today must be far more PC than in previous decades. And overall that’s a good thing. There are smart phones everywhere. Video, audio, etc. It is so easy to record anything. If you catch a Fortune 500 CEO cussing out their employees on video today, they’re gone. If LeBron James, treats his teammates like shit, they’re gone.  You’re not getting past mid-management in the corporate world today unless you’re great with people and level-headed.  Overall that means leaders need to be much more professional and more empathetic. Which is very good overalls  But yeah, you do lose some of the intensity that people like Mike brought."
[The Ringer wrote one of their more statistically sound articles about this some time ago.](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/6/14/18679091/kawhi-leonard-nba-finals-raptors-lebron-james-kevin-durant)
LeBron James
"Lebron James is the GOAT of receiving suffocating scrutiny and pressure to perform, and this will continue for every player who is touted as the ""next Jordan"". I think the pressure alone will prevent another GOAT from being crowned.  Someone has to come along, match or exceed the peak and duration of MJ's playoff prime, as well as the other accomplishments... in the age of social media. Good luck"
"A lot of Asian people love black people too. I’ve always look up to black people in a positive light. A lot of my hero’s were black. I love basketball. Ever since I was 7. Shaquille O’Neal, Allen Iverson, Kevin Garnett and LeBron James were my Idols growing up."
Name one Cav that didn't play over his actual ceiling during those 3 games. Even LeBron fucking James overperformed.
"I think James Harden is positively influencing how all ball handlers play and see the game.  Harden is 6'5"", Doncic is 6'7""(?), Lebron is even taller than them...all three guys are having a ton of success with manipulating their gather into a more delayed action to buy extra decision-making time.  And their height naturally makes the gather more delayed than it would be for a shorter ballhandler.    I think we will see more 6'5"" and up NBA primary ballhandlers as long as the game continues to be officiated the way it is right now...because if you can legally gather the way these guys do, and you have incredible handle and craft, it's a giant advantage."
"How the heck can you talk about revisionist history and spew all this shit ?   Almost everyone agreed that the FMVP was deserved .  Not even Danny Green's mother thought he could've won FMVP  ,ur confusing the years .  Ur like "" TP scored more points ,dude scored 17 a game ""carried the offense "" gtfo "" and stuff like that . Parker was the leading scorer with 18 a game and he scored 1 more point than Leonard while being first option and taking much more shots .   Leonard was automatic the whole series,took more shots in the last 3 games and closed it out  ,while also having prime Lebron James as his main assignment on D .  Their offense also had  absurd ball movement and most of the times there was one of Diaw,Parker,Gino on the court dishing dimes ,so it's not like Parker went 12 apg like another Magic  .  Wanna say Leonard didn't carry the offense ? That's cool . But suggesting  TP did is disingenuous ."
Game-tying/go-ahead field goals with under 10 seconds left in the postseason:  Michael Jordan: 7/15 (47%)  Kobe Bryant: 5/22 (23%)  LeBron James: 12/23 (52%)  Just one example..
"Westbrook put up a 9.3 VORP, which would rank as the 22nd highest ever recorded, and 10th among players not named Michael Jordan or LeBron James. While he wasn't super efficient (his TS% was pretty much league average, which is the usual knock on Russ), it was still a monster season in most facets."
"1) The Cavs win Game 1 of 2018. Draymond said he got injured the day after Game 4, with him out, and a possible 2nd win in the upcoming 3 games (the Cavs wouldn't have lost hope), they might have actually squeaked a Game 7 Victory.  2) LeBron wins DPOY and Unanimous MVP in 2013. Carmelo didn't deserve a vote and Marc Gasol made the fucking 2nd Second Defensive Team...WTF?  3) 2018 MVP went to the Runner-Up instead of James Harden. James Harden didn't deserve it."
"It’s because the league is about Lebron James. The mvp is either lebron or the one who humiliated him, except Kawhi last year. Steph should have gotten the mvp for their first title."
"LeBron James - Cavs, Heat, Cavs, Lakers...always on the move.  Only won 3 championships, lost 5 of em so maybe one day he'll be able to work with someone who can consistently get him those rings."

Oh I think Dirk played absolutely fantastic. He was a hero of heroes for anyone who was upset with the decision at the time and he played like it. It's just LeBron James in his prime should have been able to match that. Especially if people are calling him the GOAT.
LeBron James
"That was 1 year.   his three other top 2 MVP seasons and seasons where he made the WCF or fell 1-2 games short he was carrying those teams  Also Harden was by far the best player on that 65 win team. Chris Paul play improved in the playoffs and Hardens declined a little which made the playoff numbers closer but Harden was still always the man getting the bulk of the defensive attention and CP3 benefitted from that.    I’m convinced fans do not pay attention to defense and ball watch because nobody ever brings up the amount of defensive attention players get and command. besides curry , 2018 LeBron and maybe 2020 Giannis no player in the NBA has gotten as much defensive attention and had to deal with as much as pressure while still maintaining an MVP level of play as James Harden has had too any of these last 4 seasons"

Whyyyyyy do they call LeBron James a smaaaall forward?
"Lebron ""Anti-Samson"" James"
"I think it's pretty much the reason you outlined, the Knicks were the second best team in the East after usually being shit so they wanted to reward him. Another thing to consider is that Chandler was a very important part of the Mavs championship with his defence and hustle plays so the award kind of an extension of him being acknowledged for his play. Rightly or wrongly, it was a factor.        Ibaka probably should have won tho and he was a huge part of a way better OKC team that went 47-19 while he also averaged 3.7 blocks per game.       Ultimately it was a very tight count too so It's not like Chandler was a consensus pick for the award.      ||||Voti|Voti|Voti|Voti||Per|Per|Per|Per| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rank|Player|Tm|First|Pts Won|Pts Max|Share|G|MP|TRB|STL|BLK| |1|Tyson Chandler|NYK|45.0|311.0|605|0.514|62|33.2|9.9|0.9|1.4| |2|Serge Ibaka|OKC|41.0|294.0|605|0.486|66|27.2|7.5|0.5|3.7| |3|Dwight Howard|ORL|18.0|186.0|605|0.307|54|38.3|14.5|1.5|2.1| |4|LeBron James|MIA|7.0|112.0|605|0.185|62|37.5|7.9|1.9|0.8| |5|Kevin Garnett|BOS|2.0|44.0|605|0.073|60|31.1|8.2|0.9|1.0| |6|Tony Allen|MEM|4.0|36.0|605|0.060|58|26.3|4.0|1.8|0.6| |7|Andre Iguodala|PHI|1.0|33.0|605|0.055|62|35.6|6.1|1.7|0.5| |8|Shawn Marion|DAL|2.0|17.0|605|0.028|63|30.5|7.4|1.1|0.6| |9|Luol Deng|CHI|1.0|16.0|605|0.026|54|39.4|6.5|1.0|0.7|"
Yeah i assume he was 235 (which it says on bball reference) when he first joined The Spurs which definitely changed when he got ripped! As for lebron there is also footage of him making fun of the statements he is 265-280 [here](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/02/lebron-james-weight-280-pounds-reaction)
Which sucks for LeBron James because people diminish him due to his “finals record”. Playing better teams on the way and worse in the actual finals assures it remains unblemished.

"A lot of Lebron fans don't like him because:  - he won Cleveland a championship, a feat that Lebron promised Ohio, but Kyrie delivered on by hitting the dagger that beat the mighty Warriors  - he had a critically acclaimed movie ahead of Lebron James, NBA players grabbed the chance to be a part of this masterpiece of a movie while Lebron was reportedly having challenges convincing NBA players to join him in his upcoming Space Jam 2 movie  - he refuses to allow Lebron to be a father figure to him, something Lebron really wanted    with Lebron's internet army (mostly from China) making up the majority of the redditors that frequent r/nba, Kyrie gets the hate."
Dwyane Wade  LeBron James  Alonzo Mourning  Shaquille O'Neal  Tim Hardaway
1. LeBron James 2. Magic Johnson 3. Kareem Abdul Jabbar 4. Kobe Bryant 5. Shaquille O'Neal
Fun fact: Michael Jordan and the Charlotte hornets passed on drafting Lebron James in 2003. This was mostly due to the fact that Michael and the organization had nothing to do with each other and Cleveland had the first overall pick.
"Most of LeBron’s teams have been very top heavy. His losses vs the Spurs and Warriors were against very very deep teams. The loss to Dallas is on Lebron, I’m not sure if Bosh was guarding Dirk or not but Dirk was unreal that series. His last finals loss was against the greatest backcourt of all-time, one of the greatest scorers of all time, a guy whose always in the running for defensive player of the year and oh yeah Andre Iguadala. I’m not sure any team in NBA history would’ve beat the Warriors with KD in the finals.   Anthony Davis is the best teammate LeBron has ever had, he just fits better than DWade ever did with and is way more athletic and better at defense than Chris Bosh ever was, (and Bosh was really friggen good) so there’s potential for more rings.  LeBron has always and will always be a better passer than Kobe or Jordan, they just had better help (Scottie Pippen, Horace Grant, Rodman, Shaq, Paul Gasol)  And I don’t understand why you think LeBron James is uncoachable, that’s kinda laughable to say imo."

"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."

"This argument basically says that Jordan would never have been able to take advantage of all the advances we've had since his time. That's silly. The only reason we have a deeper bench of good players now is because of those advances. It's as if I made the argument that the only reason James is any good is because he has world-class dietitians and trainers, and that if he played in Jordan's time he would be a broken old man by the time he was 31. That's silly too.  You're also totally ignoring the playoff records of Jordan and James. There are only a small number of top competitors in any era, so the depth of the total NBA bench doesn't really matter when it comes to the playoffs. And Jordan has the edge in the playoffs, playing tougher opponents than James has.   I love Lebron, but MJ was not only just as talented (in different ways), but much more of a competitor."
"He had a HOF career without that winning 4 titles  2 titles in his first 3 seasons. One of the best playoff runs of his generation at guard in 2005 for a title in his 3rd season. The classic triple blown games in 2006 playoffs but paired with elite play 👍  One of the league’s best passers at guard for over 10 years paired with efficient scoring from every level of the floor with elite athleticism from 2003-11; albeit degrading a few years prior to 2011. With the ability to positively influence the team on both ends in a consistent role for his entire career.  He was shamgodding dunking and scoring at an efficienct level from everywhere year one into the playoffs. He wasn’t as good a shooter year 1 but for league average of the day he skated above. All while being a great man and help defender with size at guard or enough to play 3 for a decade. His weaknesses at 3 were allieved by defenders alongside him but we can still watch basketball and see what he does well even with other good defenders.  Who was again a part of 4 championships. His NBA career is completely HOF in its own right. It’s true if he was on another team and may have gotten 0 championships you could get squirmy with it, but he played and contributed to 4 making significant contributions to 4 of those. Everyone else is also judged favorably for their titles and had made the HOF off of such. 2005 being a claim that few players have to make with a championship season, 2007 and 2014 heavy contributions to the strength and style of both teams. Manu and Tony were both really close in 07 for that title and Timmy was by order of that equality the most important player to the team. 2 coming against LeBron James with signature moments in the close out title wins. Losses too for sake of fame."
"LeBron James had a better 41 point game in literally that same game.  Kyrie was important, yes, but James was the reason they won the series. That's my whole point."
"&gt; You clearly can’t form an opinion beyond what the stats tell you, he shot 35% from 3 on over 10 attempts a game and averaged 30/5/6 and almost 2 steals a game while having the box and one ran solely to slow him down and getting doubled whenever he touched the ball, HOW AWFUL IS THAT?  Still doesn't change the fact he was awfully inefficient out of the foul line and is a one way player that can't play defense. James Harden and LeBron James get doubled every possession of their lifes and you are here complaining that the Raptors ran a box and one, holy crap.  &gt; And how about this, instead of trying to bring curry down, let’s look at the guy he’s facing. Stockton in his one finals appearance averaged 9 points, shot under 50% and made 2 of his 9 total 3PA  Let's compare the production of different players in different eras with different responsibilities, that's probably smart.  &gt; I couldn’t imagine calling a raptors fan a lebron stan though  I guess he beat your crap team so badly for so long that you fell for him.  You literally are incapable of disproving my statement that Steph was ridiculously inefficient in the 2019 Finals and my arguments about the Jazz compared to the Rockets, so yeah, it's clear who is the moron here."
"This is a silly goddamn argument, I just want to trash KD and you're making me defend LeBron ""Taco Tuesday"" James to do it so fine, fuck you too then.      &gt;This is EXACTLY what lebron did. He knew he wouldn't be able to win with that current cavs team, so he formed a super team with the heat to chase a ring.  Ok even in these two sentences you contradict yourself. so you're saying that KD ""knew he wouldn't be able to win"" with OKC? Cause it looked like they were one game away from getting to the finals literally that year. KD ""formed a superteam... to chase a ring"" then? Or did he JOIN a superteam that beat him 2 months prior in the WCF?      You are correct that the intent was the same, I'll give you that. But LeBron caught more than enough shit for a decade and I don't think that what he did was even 1/100th as much of a cowardly move compared to KD joining the warriors man gtfo"
"Yeah sure. All of that sounds nice but that doesn't really change the fact that those who knew that the miami heat were going to win was actually correct, right? Bulls were too damn young, celtics were too damn old, im not even gonna comment on the pacers since that was PG waaaaaaay before his prime.   None of those sounds better than Lebron James, Wade, and Bosh in their prime.    It was just 1 colossal choke job that stopped them from winning 3 straight.   Lebron didnt need to play phenomenal. He didnt need to even play his average self. He could have played below average and they would have won.  What you dont understand is while the Warriors was Overpowering. So was the miami heat at that time. That time, No one was clowning Lebron for ""not 1 not 2 not 3"". He was hated for it because it was achievable. No one hated ""the decision"" because people don't like free agency. It was hated because it made a super team who people thought could win a lot of titles. And they were right.  Why do you think the miami heat were the villains?"

"That is a good point when you put into perspective how good that warriors team was however I wouldn't say ""the cavs just had LeBron James"" when kyrie averaged 27 ppg in the series"
"The Warriors were an all time great team. 73 wins in the regular season. They had the better all around team than the Cavs, the Cavs just had LeBron James. I think the ability to win a close series is more impressive by the better players in that series than just blowing a series out of the water. If you're blowing a team out of the water for a series, you have the better team, not just the best player. To win a close series, you need the best player, and that was obviously LeBron James in 2016. LeBron led both teams in all 5 major counting stats, that's never been done before, and LeBron did it while being part of the first team to ever come back from 3-1 in the finals, and the first team ever to beat a 70+ win team in the playoffs."
"You don't know what you're talking about. That Heat team got ran into the ground due to its age and the past 4 years of consecutive finals appearances. LeBron James averaged 28ppg on 68% true shooting lmao. Not much more you can do, man. It wasn't lack of leadership, it wasn't bad coaching, it was the simple fact that their average age was over 30, and they'd been to 4 straight finals."
Lebron James avg number of all star teammates = 15 all stars/17 seasons = **.882 all stars per season**  Michael Jordan avg number of all star teammates = 7 all stars/15 seasons = **.467 all stars per season**  worth noting that Scottie Pippen accounts for all 7 of those

"Some of you guys who claim that LeBron was robbed of MVP in 2011 think that it magically becomes true the more you repeat it.    All credit for this goes to u/poorchris  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's *own teammate* was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  Wade: 26 PPG 6.4 RPG 4.6 APG 1.5 SPG 1.1 BPG 50 FG%   Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  Boozer: 17.5 PPG 9 RPG 2.5 APG .3 BPG 51 FG%   Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  Bosh: 19 PPG 8 RPG 2 APG .6 BPG 50 FG%   Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season. Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  &gt;""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  &gt;""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  &gt;""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  &gt;""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  &gt;""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  &gt;""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""  Scottie Pippen  &gt;""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  &gt;""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  &gt;""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  &gt;""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  &gt;""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  &gt;""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  &gt;""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  &gt;""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  &gt;""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  &gt;""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  &gt;""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  &gt;""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  &gt;""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  &gt;""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  &gt;""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron James himself, when asked to weigh in on MVP race  &gt;""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
"Lmao I was reading up on this incident and found [this gem](https://www.businessinsider.com/warriors-players-rip-lebron-james-for-draymond-green-suspension-2016-6):  &gt;Charles Barkley, a TNT analyst and former NBA player, said on Bleacher Report radio on Sunday that Green had a ""moral obligation"" to retaliate against LeBron for stepping over him.  &gt;""That's really disrespectful to step over a guy. You're supposed to pop him in his junk if he steps over you like that,"" he said."
"Forgetting that it was the Cavs team &amp; social media that posted their overreaction on social media, *so that the NBA would upgrade the on-floor technical to a flagrant 1*  Acting like it was automatic is disingenuous. [Per BR:](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2645740-lebron-james-draymond-green-altercation-reportedly-being-reviewed-by-nba)  &gt;Chris Haynes of Cleveland.com reported the Cavaliers were ""pushing hard to see to it [Green is] punished appropriately"" for the incident, and the league was receiving pressure from both teams."
"Add LeBron James to any 50 win team and they become contenders. Even rookie Bron would be a huge boost.  That being said, that wasn't a particularly likely scenario. Yes, we ended up with the #2 pick, but we only had the 6th worst record. Even moving up to #2 was a jump, which I'm sure Detroit was very happy about."
Check your team's performance when Davis is leading it and check how many times Davis missed the playoffs with a sub .500 record before teaming up with LeBron James and then get back to me
"The Grizzlies had a 6% chance at the 1st overall pick. By this logic, the Nuggets, Raptors, Heat, and Clippers all ""almost"" landed LeBron, even over the Grizzlies.  The Grizzlies receiving the 2nd overall pick (which went to the Pistons) was actually dependent on them NOT receiving the first round pick, which 5 other teams had a better shot at. The field (vs. the Grizzlies) had a 93.6% chance at LeBron James. Sorry, forgot the Grizzlies had the Rockets lottery pick. The field had a 92.9% chance, not 93.6%."
"LMAO and that team is total dick without LeBron James. Not even slightly above average or mediocre, literally just bad."
"he's saying the Grizz has the number 2 pick in the draft, but it was only the first pick protected so they had to give it to the Pistons. The Grizz were the runner up for LeBron James"
"AFAIK, no one had a trade to almost move to #1 because no GM in their right mind would have turned down a shot at LeBron James. This isn't even 20/20 hindsight, this is reality. LBJ was so far and away the best possible pick at #1, no GM would have considered a trade other than for just the reason of doing due diligence that's required of being a good GM."
Wilt Chamberlain and Lebron James.

"If you stuck Lebron James. Kevin Durant, James Harden, Steph Curry, etc with their current skillsets and thei primes in the 8-'s and 90's they'd absolutely dominate that era maybe even better than how they're dominating now because the wings and guards of that era simply would not be able to guard someone like KD, Harden, or Lebron one on one. It would be damn near impossible. Just no one from that era is long enough, athletic enough, and has the speed to do it. Can you imagine PF's guarding KD's walk up three-pointers and mid-range shots? He'd gas out those guys by the third quarter.  I also love how Jay brings up the 60's and mentions no one in sports media states that the best player of the 80's or 90's wouldn't be able to compete in the 60's."
Lebron James is a virgin and only had sex with his wife to create children. He also didn't like the sex either.   Don't take away their santa clause.

"His PR team has definitely squashed a lot of bad stories.  I remember Arash Markazi had one around 2010 or so that followed Lebron in Vegas. You won't find it on google now, but it was on the front page of ESPN at the time.  Basically, the story said, in a summary:  &gt;“The more you hang around James, the more you realize he’s still a child wrapped in a 6-foot-8, 250-pound frame,” Markazi wrote in the story, posted at 9:40am ET Wednesday. It was pulled shortly thereafter.

"&gt; Living in the Bay Area during that period, it was everywhere.  don't you think this has something to do with your perspective, though? I can imagine Bay Area reactions were different than other pockets of the world. I mean I live in the south and there was no such indifference towards the Warriors. I was around people who didn't watch basketball but did know of LeBron James as a celebrity and rooted for him to win. I know people who didn't like Steph and Klay because they were light skinned and grew up rich while LeBron grew up poor. These things have nothing to do with ball, but it gives people a reason to get invested into what they are watching.  You could find the draymond thing on the front page of MSN if you opened internet explorer, pretty sure"
I was just getting into basketball when I was watching this series. I was so happy that we were about to beat the heat! Then Lebron James ruined my hopes and dreams
"And the opposite is also true. People cry that you need to lay off ""their guy"" when celebrating a victory and let them enjoy it. Yet once *another guy* has a victory it's all ""nah our guy is much better! Look at this stats!""  Case in point: The Last Dance, a documentary about MJ and the 90's Bulls, which's comment sections on social media are 80% about LeBron James.  People really need to just chill with all this crying and simultaneously screaming for blood."
"&gt;Bill Cosby was beloved too  Bill Cosby still is beloved by many people.  Snoop Dogg for one has made multiple posts on twitter and instagram how Bill Cosby is a victim and needs to be freed.  [This post by Snoop which ends with ""Free Bill Cosby"" was liked by more than half a million people including LeBron James](https://imgur.com/a/o6lw3vx)"
&gt;similarly duncan makes the layup a few years prior and we’re not talking about James as if he’s top 2 all time.  which makes no sense to me.      How does a single possession *by a different* player affect your view of Lebron as a basketball player?     Does this not suggest that maybe rings is an awful metric for judging players careers?
"When him and Giannis matched up for a stretch it was hilarious how LeBron easily overpowered Giannis by backing him down and getting right to the rim, while Giannis couldn’t even move James"
"bruh, if you wanna give LeBron credit for knocking out HoF Shaq at age 38, then maybe you should criticize LeBron for not being able to win with a HoF Shaq at age 37 when they were teammates.

"I actually thought that was where he was going lmao. I was pretty convinced.  Made sense to me at the time. KD/Curry/Klay/Dray/Kerr vs LeBron/Harden/CP3/Capela/MDA. LeBron is banana boat buddies with CP3.  KD joined a 73 win team that lost to LeBron in 7. LeBron would join a *65 win team that lost to KD in 7. *And they were like 50-5 when their top 3 or 4 were all healthy.  It'd be kinda like LeBron calling KD's bet. ""You saw I barely had a championship edge, so you added yourself to the team I barely beat, to form a team that I'll have no chance against. Alright, I'll do the same thing.""  KD and LeBron were/are the clear top 2 players in the league for a long time and had some close MVP races. Curry and Harden were/are the clear top 2 guards in the league and had some close MVP races. Now both pairs of guys are matched up against each other, simultaneously.  MDA is an offensive genius. He made the double point guard experiment work incredibly well. If CP3 sacrificed his numbers to be the third wheel (and I'm sure he would to win a championship), I think it's likely MDA could make a LeBron and Harden offense work and get them both their numbers. And holy shit, the passing between LeBron, CP3, and Harden would be insane. Harden doesn't get enough respect for his passing imo.  I was pretty convinced it was gonna happen. Thought the only reason he'd go to the Lakers was for branding, and there was no need since he was already LeBron James. Didn't think any of their ""young core"" (Lonzo, Ingram, Hart, Kuzma being all hyped up) would appeal to him.  Was right on that last part, he shipped em all out (minus Kuz). But I underestimated the staying power of the Laker brand. Superstars like AD, Kawhi, PG13 still wanted to play for them even though they've been no good for a decade."
95% of people pay very little attention to anything lebron James does. Positive or negative. But it will be brought up everytime he tries to get political for the rest of his life. He’s completely lost credibility in that arena. Before I thought it was a dick move to tell him to “shut up and dribble” now I think that’s all he’s good for.
"I don't know how I somehow forgot the 2014 Spurs, but I'd definitely say that is a better team than any team MJ faced in the Finals - being an older but more refined version of the 2007 Spurs. The 2014 Spurs thrived off teamwork, and is known for their dominance from exactly that.  The 2007 Spurs had post-leg injury Tim Duncan (who still played fantastic), MVP candidate Tony Parker, 6MOTY candidate Manu Ginobili, and All-Defensive First Team Bruce Bowen against LeBron James and players who had no business being in the Finals.  Don't mind me though, my perspective of the teams Jordan faced is purely off paper and YouTube videos so I can't exactly place them with the respect they deserve.  From what I have seen and what I can establish though, those Spurs and Warriors teams are all better than the 90s teams that lost in the Finals to MJ. We're talking the greatest power forward in history (not to mention a top 10 player all-time) and the greatest shooter in history with the perfect supporting cast being on the list of teams that beat LeBron James in the Finals."
Imagine if this happened when the nba reopened and one of the players who gets it is a superstar ie lebron James/AD. The whole playoffs would be automatically ruined.
"&gt; I cannot relate at all to how much these athletes seem to live in your guys’ heads.  Lol I like when people say this. Bro, we don't go around talking shit about LeBron James 24/7. We're having a discussion here so we're going to discuss it. After this then that thought is gone.  People who say shit like ""Oh, that shit or he lives in your head rent free"" are probably the ones who think about this shit more. lol"
"That Dwyane Wade was a superstar.  0 MVPs, only 2 All-NBA First Team.  All of his three titles were because of better players on the roster (Jermaine O'neal and Shaquille O'neal in 2006; LeBron James in the other 2).  Very overrated."
"Nah I think my opinion is pretty sound. You seem very bothered by the fact that LeBron James, a guy who at least has OK case for being the GOAT (even if it isn’t better than Jordan’s), said he feels he’s the GOAT. You are upset by this."
LeBron and James are some douches. Just childish.
"If LeBron James signed in Houston, the Rockets would have a Championship."
"if lebron james killed your family drunk driving i bet you wouldn't let people say ""just talk about his basketball, forget that family he killed with his range rover"" when people pointed out he was a shitty person"
"Agreed. Imagine if Lebron James’s own production company made a Lebron James puff piece and to top it off, went uncredited as to imply impartiality? We would crucify Lebron."
"&gt;LeBron James had the absolute misfortune of being drafted by one of the worst basketball franchises in the league.  Really? He was drafted when the team was owned by Gordon Gund. Gund took over for LITERALLY the worst NBA owner of all time. He proceeded to own a team that went to the playoffs 10 of the first 15 years that he owned the team (the first two years digging out of the Stepien mess)  He sells to Gilbert in 2005, and in the next 5 years they win 50,50,45,66,&amp;61 games with a Finals trip and an ECF's trip.   LeBron's last two years in Cleveland they go 127-37 which was the best record in the league.   Now you can say ""oh they didn't have enough weapons"" or ""the Cavs FO failed to put together a good team"" but I would argue that LeBron's constant pressure on the team and unwillingness to commit long term forced the team's hand to make short-sighted moves.   Now, not to throw shade on the Heat, but I really hope you're not insinuating that the infrastructure there was what made it possible to win....it wasn't that it was Wade being a top 5 player, Bosh being top 20, and the Pistons and the Celtics in the East (as well as the Cavs) not being a threat anymore that helped him win in Miami.   One of the worst organizations in the league? Get the fuck out of here. Sick of that stupid ass narrative. Gilbert is abrasive but he spent money when they were good, and he spent money when they were bad in order to get assets. Any fan should be so lucky to have an owner who's never going to cheap out, like Mickey Arison with Mike Miller? Or Sarver during the 00's Suns teams.   Anyways, had to defend this dumb narrative once I read the first graph of your shitty post."
"There's 0.8 seconds left and they have to inbound it.  The original play didn't work and both Jordan and Kukoc take off towards the inbounding player to just get someone the ball.  Jordan doesn't cut off Kukoc, they take different paths and someone has to grab that ball and fire it as fast as possible.  You make it sound like there's 8 seconds left and they can take their time and all plays work exactly as drawn up.  Your hate for Jordan being considered the GOAT is unreal. Why even bother trying to make a LeBron James comparison?"
"I don't think so. Look at Miami Lebron, there are still people who bitch about how Ray Allen saved James' career."
"It’s pretty clear Wade is the instigator and LeBron is following Wade’s lead.  As a Heat fan and a Wade homer, I’m of two minds.   On one hand, had the Heat won this series, we’d be looking at this incident like we look at most of MJ’s moments of bad sportsmanship. Whatever it takes to psych yourself up to meet the moment.  But on the other hand, it’s clearly a bad look for Wade (and to a lesser extent James).  It’s important to remember the context in any event. Wade was amazing in this series and would likely have been named Finals MVP if Miami had won the series. LeBron shrank from the moment and you can even sort of see his demeanor in this moment as well."
"And then Lebron went on to score a whopping 8 points in game 4, single handedly blowing the whole series and making Wade yell in his face to get his shit together. Thanks King James. Michael Jeffrey Jordan would have never..."
"This perfectly describes how frustrating it must be for opposing teams to deal with Harden. It's not that he's ""unguardable"", it's that he's a master at drawing fouls and making unnecessary contact. There are many better shooters in the league that have faster release, better handles, and greater accuracy.   Players like Steph don't need the double step back, they can do the standard single step back and get the shot in. The thing about Harden is that if you get too close to guard his double step back, he's going to flop on you on his way down, it's practically built into his shooting form. Next thing you know, you're already in foul trouble because the next possession, he eurosteps into you on a drive.      If you watch videos of players being asked who the hardest person to guard is, they say Steph Curry, or LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving. It's not hard to guard Harden, it's just hard to do it without getting called for a bullshit foul."
"Stockton or AI need to fall off your list and be replaced by Jerry West. West averaged 26/10/4 for statistically the best team ever until Jordan’s Bulls. (67-10 in games he played that season). Also won the title.   Also won finals MVP for a losing team, and has basically the same career averages as... Lebron James"
"&gt; But jordan clearly runs directly infront of Kukoc as the pass is sent out, just watch the tape. Imagine if ~~Ty Lue~~ Lebron James wrote down a play for Kyrie Irving who happened to blazing hot, but Lebron ran right in front of him to intercept the pass and proceeded to airball it. He would get ripped apart for that.   fixed it for you"
"It's really telling that Amir is being raked over the coals, here. I would 100% expect the referee to let it go, first. Why not let Amir hold the ball. Plenty of players have ""rituals,"" and superstitious habits in sports, and if the player is a star that shit is revered as some method to the madness that is their excellence. The referee all of a sudden decides to power-trip over this one free throw? It's nonsensical. I could easily see Draymond Green getting a tech for something like this, and I can also easily see a referee letting go of the ball if a player like LeBron James was the one wanting to hold it in that moment.   Amir should have let it go, it's weird hill to die on, but if you were to expect one of these two to be the more mature person, it would be the 65 year old referee. Why is he getting a pass for occupying that same hill? This is power-tripping, and likely something to do with Johnson's first technical foul."

"I cannot relate at all to how much these athletes seem to live in your guys’ heads. Are you really this bothered by the fact that LeBron James stated that he thinks he’s the GOAT? Do you *REALLY* think that Michael Jordan, a man who called himself black jesus, DOESN’T think he’s the GOAT? And why would it make a difference whether or not he spoke the words into existence?  You guys are way too bothered by this. I bet anyone near the top thinks they’re the GOAT. I absolutely think that KD probably believes he’s the best basketball player ever. Why shouldn’t he? Just because some redditors would be hurt by it?"
"I just looked at it and it looks like he has MJ as #[2](https://backpicks.com/2018/04/08/backpicks-goat-2-michael-jordan/) overall and Bron at #[3](https://backpicks.com/2018/04/05/backpicks-goat-3-lebron-james/).  He basically says he's the best peak player, but didn't exhibit longevity -   &gt;*Therefore, he’s my highest peak player, but falls short in career value to Abdul-Jabbar, landing at No. 2.*"

"I can’t think of anything specific but a warriors cavs finals game would be good. The game plan the warriors have is the best of modern basketball, with slick passing and fire at will play. Stephen Curry is the greatest shooter ever, and makes some ridiculous shots. The plays are really fun to watch. On the other side, you have Kyrie, a master ball handler, and Lebron James, a physical specimen and one of the top 2 GOATs. I am not a fan of either team, but would recommend their matchups to experience modern b-ball for the first time."

"Could you explain what you mean with that?  Nobody would tell an everyday middle class American worker to “stay in their lane” every time they speak about their political opinions, so why should Steve Kerr? Just because he is rich and famous, does not mean that he doesn’t have a stake in the elections that we ALL vote in.   It is just wild to me, the vote of everyday Americans matters just as much as Steve Kerr, or Lebron James’ vote. Why should we tell them to “stay in their lane” because they are rich and successful? They are tax paying voting Americans and their opinions are just as valid as ours.  I imagine that when Donald trump was simply a reality TV star with no political credentials, constantly bitching about President Obama you weren’t telling him to “stay in his lane”, were you?  Edit: and that is coming from a fellow Knicks fan"
"Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, Luol Deng, LeBron James, Joakim Noah."
If lebron James harden was a person
"This. He’s confident but he’s also quite prideful and arrogant. Maybe not to the degree as some other players but I would def not call him humble. It doesn’t come to mind when I think of LeBron James. Which on its own ain’t a big problem but that first year in Miami was lulzworthy. I didn’t care too much with his whole rally statement or playing the villain, but I do remember thinking dude was pretty cocky despite the Heatles not even proving themselves as a devastating squad yet"
[Basically the Lebron James theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzUKcXxbU4U)
"No we're not. Sure, he lost his fair share of playoff series early on, but as was the case with LeBron, he didn't have that much help. It was only when Pippen and Grant arrived and improved as players that he had a solid supporting cast, imo. Also, let's not forget who he was losing to... more often than not, it was Boston and Detroit, two teams who were getting to the Finals and winning their fair share of them in the late 80s. Jordan's Eastern Conference was generally a lot stronger than what James had to deal with (with a few exceptions, of course)."
"Because championships shouldn't be what you use to consider whether someone is better than someone else. It's as simple as do you think LeBron James is a better basketball player and to some that answer is yes. The question isn't who has more accolades, it's who is more skilled in the sport."
"&gt;Adam Sandler is set to star in Hustle, a basketball-themed Netflix movie involving the NBA that hails from producer LeBron James, Collider has learned.   It's right there in the article, LeBron is producing this movie."
The school does not get built with the LeBron James Foundation. It's as simple as simple as that. No shit he is not gonna pay every single time of a public school helping disadvantaged kids. He is still putting in tremendous work and helping hundreds of kids and their families.
"There’s probably a 50/50 chance we’re gonna see Pete Davidson and LeBron James on the same screen, what a timeline."
"Considering the impact that the LeBron James Family Foundation has had for the underprivileged kids of his hometown, his donation to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, and donations to the Children’s Defense Fund, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and OneXOne, he’s done quite a bit wouldn’t you say?"
"I don't even know where to begin to describe it. I live in Germany and I know it is similar in France and Italy but maybe it's a bit different in the UK. But in general the following is roughly the same wherever you go in in Europe.   Aside from special interest teams (say Giannis Buck's in Greece or Dirk's Mavs in Germany) MJ's second threepeat team and the Shaq &amp; Kobe Lakers are the only American sports teams ever that were religiously covered well within the mainstream media. It's usually a world completely dominated by football and at the time maybe a bit of formula1. Not just the sports programms showed their highlights almost almost daily, they were even talked about in the gossip shows in the afternoon shows. In contrast, LeBron James' team maybe gets a 5-10 minute segment at the end of our biggest weekly sports show during the play-offs. Of course after the football highlights have already run and 90% of the viewers turned off the channel. Plus mabye a 30second segment in the news when he wins a title. Maybe. You have to actively seek out the NBA and american sports to come into contact with him whereas everybody knew MJ and Kobe.  Consequently their commercials ran for many years and permeated all levels of society. For a really long time they were on posters everywhere and their products sold like crazy. LeBron James has not a single major campaign that resonated in Europe in the same way, how could he, barely anyone really knows him! To be honest I can't even remember a single big commercial in recent years where he was more than just a small part of a Nike line-up alongside other star athletes like Serena Williams who also happens to be far more popular and well known than LeBron James.  At the end of the day when you go onto a street in Germany and ask some random bloke who Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant are and there's more than a 90% chance that they know exactly who you're talking about. LeBron James? I wouldn't be surprised if one third never even heard his name before, the biggest group probably heard of him and is generally aware that he's a great basketball player but don't know anything about him beyond that. Then there's a sizeable well informed sports audience that follows american sports who know all about him. But in comparison to Kobe and MJ's audiences that gorup is tiny."
"Even Shaq himself said he considers Giannis the Superman of this era as big Shaq is the one and only Superman.   I thought that was pretty cool. If Giannis continues to grow and develop as a shooter he could be the best player in the league, but honestly hot take but Id take James Harden over Giannis in today's NBA, I think top 5 players are LeBron Kawhi healthy KD, healthy Steph, and James Harden.   Giannis is getting there but still hasn't shown more than James Harden has other than defense given that he is a 7ft freak. Even with the MVP to his name I think Anthony Davis is better and is the best big in the league."
"That was 100% media driven. Seriously. [Take a look at their stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;player_id1_select=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;y1=2020&amp;player_id1=antetgi01&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;player_id2_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id2_select=LeBron+James&amp;y2=2020&amp;player_id2=jamesle01&amp;idx=bbr__players)  Giannis absolutely slaughters LeBron in nearly all advanced statistics. Not to mention, Giannis doesn't have another superstar next to him."
"attempting to quantify philanthropic achievements (as...absurd as that would be) in a league that also had the likes of bill russell &amp; kareem abdul-jabbar, to name a few likely wouldn't tip the argument in favour of lebron james of all people"
"The context of this quote, or the intent, I should say, is relevant.   I think what he meant to say since he is clearly on the Lebron side of the GOAT debate, is that Lebron takes on more responsibility than probably anyone who has ever played, which is true. When you are like Magic plus the teams best scorer and smartest player, as James almost always is, everything revolves around you. Whereas Jordan played like a very traditional 2. And I think the way it came out made it sound like it was about capability and so people are running with it."
"He makes some decent points at the end, but mostly stupid points throughout.  &gt; Jordan inspired the next generation of players to play like him and changed the game forever. There’s an alternate universe where LeBron and Durant and Giannis would be forced to spend their careers on the low block... Dirk Nowitzki’s father was a professional handball player. Maybe Dirk would have been like him if the NBA hadn’t exploded the way it did thanks to Michael.  &gt; We all stand on the shoulders of giants. It doesn’t matter whether Isaac Newton was a greater scientist than Albert Einstein—Einstein couldn’t have existed without him.  That is good perspective.  &gt; Jordan was never a prolific 3-point shooter, averaging just 1.7 attempts per game over his career and shooting a pedestrian 32.7 percent.  LeBron takes more attempts but shoots 34.4% for his career, and the exact same 33.2% in the playoffs. League average is also about 3% higher.  &gt; It’s also a response to the rule changes of the early 2000s that gave defenses the ability to run zones and play farther off of offensive players than ever before. The best defenses of the past decade would have been illegal in the 1990s.  Offenses are way more OP than defenses nowadays.  During Jordan's prime, league average ORtg was 108 and TS% was 53-54%. The last 2 years, league average ORtg is 110 and TS% is 56%.  If you surrounded him with the same type of shooting that players have today, his and his team's offensive stats would go up, not down because of freer defensive rules.  &gt; But opponents would be able to force Jordan to be a passer in ways they weren’t allowed to in his prime. Anytime that 2020 Jordan were to play with a nonshooter, that player’s defender would clog the lane and force him to give up the ball.  Jordan wasn't a non-passer. In fact, he was a really good passer who averaged 6 apg for his playoff career despite playing in the triangle rather than his team running the offense through him. When they did run it through him in 1989, he averaged 31/8/9 (with less than 4 turnovers) for over half a season.  &gt; LeBron James (6-foot-9 and 250 pounds), Kevin Durant (6-foot-10, 240 pounds), and Giannis Antetokounmpo (6-foot-11, 240 pounds)? The question isn’t whether LeBron would be tough enough to survive his own version of the Jordan Rules. It’s whether they would even work against someone who weighs almost 300 pounds.  240 and 250 isn't ""almost 300 pounds."" They're bigger but you don't need to exaggerate to prove a point.  The Jordan Rules wasn't just hand-checking, it was a zone defense plus midair flagrant fouls. The Raptors shut down Giannis running a similar zone, except they at least played him clean rather than trying to injure him like Laimbeer would.  &gt; Jordan (6-foot-6 and 195 pounds) and Pippen (6-foot-8 and 210 pounds) terrorized a generation of smaller, slower perimeter players. You know what they would be to a 7-footer with a turnaround jumper? Chairs.  That was what they weighed early in their careers. Giannis weighed 196 at his Combine. In their primes, Jordan was listed 216 and Pippen was listed 228. And they'd probably be bigger today, everyone carries more muscle on their frames.  &gt; Williams: I always have these debates with my friends. Can you imagine dropping LeBron in 1975? He would win 15 championships in a row.  If LeBron stepped into a time machine onto a 1975 court, yeah, he'd win 15 championships in a row. He's benefited from a ton of advances in training, medicine, equipment, etc in the 45 years since then. Not to mention getting to watch the greats since then and model his game after them (the author's good point about Einstein and Newton).  If you put baby LeBron in a time machine and had him born in 1955, he would probably just be one of several greats defining that era, along with Kareem, Moses, Dr J, and eventually Bird and Magic. Maybe he'd still be the best among them, but he wouldn't win even 5 in a row, let alone 15."
"Wasn’t it reported that MJ finally gave clearance for the doc after watching Lebron win in 2016?  No question he felt threatened. I’m not saying he’s the GOAT but when you consider the difference in eras+competition level, and also the fact that James has been elite for 17+ seasons consecutive with no break in between, its obvious that future generations will put him in the GOAT discussion on his merits. And Jordan can see it coming so he had to reestablish his narratives."
"and you are seriously understimating how absolutely huge are Maradona and Messi around the entire world. do you know that Brazil and Argentina are soccer enemies, like Lakers-Celtics rivalry, right? a few years ago the FIFA made a poll for the best player of the history and Maradona beat Pelé EVEN IN BRAZIL! you are talking about some random kids, i'm talking about million of brazilians voting for Maradona against Pelé. can you imagine a poll for the best NBA players and Larry Bird beating Kobe or Magic in LA? ""Jordan is Jordan"". yes, and Maradona is Maradona. a social phenomenon with poor people loving him and popular musicians making songs about him. and Messi is Messi. and soccer is football. most kids in Brazil, Cameroon, India, England or Japan dream to be a football player, not a basketball player. how many songs are dedicated to Jordan? that's popularity and social engagment. I'm not talking about a publicity campaign  &amp;#x200B;  edit: an example: Messi has 151M of followers on Instagram. LeBron James has 64.5M. that's the difference between footbal and basket  &amp;#x200B;  edit two: "" With unmatched reach and passion from massive fanbases around the world, international soccer stars hold a clear advantage on social media.  This year’s results show that 63 of the 100 most-followed athletes are soccer players, including the three most-followed athletes across Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram ""   [https://opendorse.com/blog/the-top-100-athletes-on-social-media-2019/](https://opendorse.com/blog/the-top-100-athletes-on-social-media-2019/)"
"Its not just the amount of Finals MVPs. Its the fact that he wasn't the Finals MVP for 4 out of his 6 rings. How can he be the second best player all time behind Michael Jordan, but be the 2nd best player behind Not-Michael-Jordan for 4 out of his 6 championships?   I did mention his MVPs in another comment. MVPs are a product of who else is in the league. Example: by every metric, 2009 Dwyane Wade had a better season than all 4 of KAJ's MVPs that he won after most advanced stats are available. Dwyane Wade was 3rd in MVP voting because KAJ was competing with mid 30's Jerry West, mid 30's Oscar Robertson, Bob McAdoo and Dave Cowens, while Wade was competing with prime LeBron James, Chris Paul, Dirk, Kobe, and Duncan. Almost none of KAJ's MVPs were won over anyone impressive."
"If people don't want to accept the fact that LeBron James dominates Kareem in all regular season, playoff, and career advanced statistics, I don't know what to say."
"It's 10 hours devoted to proving that Michael Jordan is better than Lebron James, of course you're not going to give the role players too much credit. Even the segment on Kerr was basically ""I wasn't that good, but I could play with MJ and he told he to be ready"""
"Warriors beat LeBrons team in 2015, and they didn't have 4 All Stars then.  And sure they'll be remembered for 3-1. It was one of their 5 Finals appearances. Steph Curry is gonna retire with more Finals appearances than Chris Paul, James Harden, Dwight Howard, and Russell Westbrook combined. Losing in two of those appearances isn't the best, but it's better than all but one of his contemporaries (GOAT candidate LeBron), and people will remember that."
"This is irrefutable proof that at 13 years old, I was a better basketball player than LeBron James."
"There are so many criteria (objective and subjective) that you can debate until the cows come home.  You have so many variables to consider, and context as well:  - Playstyles between eras - Stats and advanced stats - Championships and other accolades - Skillsets and attributes - How would one or the other compare in different eras? - etc.  Then you have to have set definitions of certain terms and examples that are consistent with the definitions. For example, we hear so many times that Lebron James lacks a killer mentality or has no ""clutch gene."" But, we also disregard, sometimes, some of his greatest games that had high stakes, especially elimination games or game 7s. Aren't those considered ""clutch"" performances?  Regardless, Lebron's career is not over yet and, judging by what he has accomplished so far this season prior to the suspension of the season, he has some stuff left in the tank. Even MJ said wait until a player's career is over before we can ultimately dissect how they should be portrayed and be compared to."
"Something that matters a lot is where you get drafted.  Lebron James was on the Cavaliers for the first 7 seasons of his career (winning 2 MVPs) and the next best player they got to play alongside him was.. Zydrunas Ilgauskas?  Mo Williams?  In these 7 seasons, his teammates only made an All-Star appearance twice.  Cleveland truly wasted what was probably the best asset an NBA team has ever had, draft rights to Lebron."
Maybe if LeBron rested a few games he would've made the playoffs last year. Imagine adding LeBron James and not even getting 8th seed
"Lebron James' teams were only favored in 2 of his 9 NBA Finals.  &amp;#x200B;  That said, Michael Jordan is still the GOAT."
"His only argument is MVPs, except until you contextualize*** them and realize the only people he had to beat out for them were mid-30's Oscar Robertson and Jerry West.  How the fuck is the second best player all time not the best player on even half of his championship teams?  Look at any stats, and he really doesn't have any argument over LeBron. But please go ahead and give me an argument for KAJ over James.   Edit: word"
Roses are red  Violets are blue   Fuck LeBron James   I’m the greatest player ever
"[They're actually neck-and-neck, at around 10% of active players each, with MJ getting around 70%.](https://www.sportscasting.com/michael-jordan-or-lebron-james-who-do-nba-players-think-is-the-goat/) It's just not newsworthy for someone to say that LeBron or Jordan is better than Kobe, so those quotes don't make it to the headlines here."
"Better stats?  LeBron James Value Over Replacement Player for his career up to this point (he's 35 years old, and VORP is a cumulative stat: 133.2  KAJ VORP for his entire career (played until 41 years old): 85.7   KAJ averages in his statistical prime '70-'81: 28.1/14.1/4.4/1.2/3.4, 0.556 2PT%/FG% (no 3 pointers so his FG% was his 2pt%)   LeBron averages from his second year to now: 27.5/7.6/7.5/1.6/0.8, 0.557% 2pt%, 0.346 3pt%, 0.510 FG%   LeBron James from his second year in the league to now has comparable stats to just KAJ's prime."
"All that sounds really good until you realize that LeBron James was still averaging 34, 13, and 8 throughout that finals without any other scoring threats due to Irving and Love being injured.   So he was inefficient? He literally had to be lol. Nobody else was scoring points."
"Im not, but go ahead with #FeelsOverReals   LeBron James number of seasons top 10 in BPM: 16  KAJ number of seasons top 10 in BPM: 12, however its very likely he would've made this mark for his first 4 seasons, when BPM isn't recorded, so we'll give him 16 as well.  So unless you think this was Lebron's last year of MVP level production, then he will in fact surpass KAJ in that category next season.  KAJ career average PER at 35 (despite entering the league 3 years older than Bron did): 26.3  LeBron career average PER at 35: 27.5   Bron at this point in his career has been better than Kareem had by this point in his career, and is showing no signs of slowing down.  Now, for playoffs, where KAJ has 6 total seasons with a VORP over 1.0, and one season over 2.0 VORP. However, his first four season dont have this tracked, so lets assume he had 10 playoff runs over 1.0 VORP and 4 over 2.0  LeBron James  has never had a playoff run under a VORP of 1.0, giving him 13 playoff runs over 1.0 VORP. Of those, 10 were over 2.0 VORP, and 3 were over a 3.0 VORP. KAJ's career high VORP for a playoff run is 2.2. LeBron James met or surpassed this 8 times.   There's no real argument for KAJ over Bron."
"LeBron James, since as you put it his hard work obviously manifests itself in his game, both in how durable he’s been and how much his game has evolved since the beginning of his career. And I’ve only ever heard good things about his off-season work ethic."
"If Kobe can make Lebron look submissive in several games then Jordan would do the same.  Kobe and Jordan had the same moves and attitude.  Jordan was better at driving and Kobe was a better shooter.  Kobe always put Lebron in his place.  Obviously it’s still Lebron James though.  He still got a few shots in on Kobe, but overall Kobe usually got the best of Lebron."

"I don't know if any other team really has enough for a fully engaging ten episodes, and there's no other central character that comes close to having the global awareness/reach/interest of Michael Jordan.   The closest might be covering a full ten year stretch of the 00s Lakers. Plenty of drama. Plenty of controversy. Plenty of big characters. It would be a hard one to tell in the same way though, obviously because of Kobe, but even if he were alive, he wasn't legally allowed to talk about Colorado. I mean, he could talk about it like ""I had this thing going on and it had an impact on the team in this way"" but he couldn't address the actual subject at all, even if he wanted to, and the personal trials and tribulations were an important part of the Last Dance. Still, there's a whole lot there across the whole team through that whole span.    That's considering an audience wider than basketball-nuts. If just considering that crowd ('us') then I think there's stories to be told in the future, and stories that could be told now. For example, it would be 'nice' to see multi-parter that covers the full Pop-era at the Spurs. A sort of defining documentation of it all. Down the line, I feel like the Warriors story is more of a single 2hr thing. And neither of those really reach beyond the basketball-fan.    I can't remember where I read it, but I saw a brief blurb somewhere in a Last Dance article that was asking a similar question to this, and it suggested that a Lebron James story would be more interesting if told as a kind of reflection of 'our times', which I kind of agree with. The plot points in his career and his role and place and reach and whatnot.  What I think they meant, and certainly what I mean, is that something like Lebron switching teams multiple times, so heavily controlling his own 'brand' in so many ways, including his public voice - the backstory of that and 'player empowerment' is really more interesting when told within it's broader context. An insight into whatever exact moment it was when Lebron decided ""fuck it, I'm going back to Cleveland"" is interesting, but not as interesting perhaps as how and why you get to a point of the player as bigger than the team and player in control of their own brand and media and whatnot (player-as-brand etc). You can see how it could become a de-facto view into societal and cultural shifts from things like the age of social and digital media etc. I really do think that's the most interesting thing about Lebron and it's through that angle that you can better see and understand his career - good and bad. It's easy and lazy to say that Lebron is just ""all about me"" in so many ways, but it's not *him*, really."
"And what does that have to do with their primes coinciding? LeBron James and Shaun Livingston are the same age, so Shaun Livingston is still in his prime too right?  Zeke was drafted three years before Stockton, and his aging curve was very frontloaded. Meanwhile, Stockton had one of the most inhumanly long careers of any NBA player ever."

Ok my turn imma just do players off the top of my head  Lebron james - I did it correctly  Anthony canks - Anthony Davis   Pascal Siakam - Correct again  Hakeem olajuwon - Close Enough  Kristaps porzinbks - Porzingis  Luka Doncic - Correct  Fred vsnvleet - Vanvleet  Giannis antetokkjmnoi - However the fuck You spell his last name  James harden- Correct again   I don’t know if this impressive or just plain sad with how much I use my phone
Lebron James never had the makings for a varsity athlete!
"I love Lebron James, he was the hero of my early adolescence from 2012-2016 and he made me love the NBA more than I ever would have without him.  But when you look at everything in this documentary, regardless of how biased it may or may not have been, this was not a show about the second greatest basketball player ever. It just wasn’t. MJ has never been surpassed."
"I have a fucking obvious bias here, but I don’t know if a fan base has had more hope stripped from them than Indiana. Reggie was my idol growing up and he had it. The 98 team probably wins without Mike existing. But fucking Michael Jordan exists.  Flash forward to the early 2010s and the Pacers being really fucking good with Paul George, Roy Hibbert, Lance, and George Hill for multiple years. A team more than capable of winning a title. Top seeds, etc... but fucking LeBron James exists.  Like I get it man, but fuck. I hope it happens in my life. Oladipo going out last year was so heartbreaking. The team has had some grooving this year but man.  Like I’m happy to have a team in contention, but sometimes I envy fan bases that never had hope to begin with because they don’t have that hope pried from the jaws of victory by generational talents like Mike or LeBron.  I’m glad Dirk got Dallas their win in 2010. I like to live vicariously through that pretending that’s what it would’ve felt like if Reggie pulled it out over Mike."
"Any mention of how Utah was screwed out of 5 points by the refs (Eisley 3 negated that beat the shot clock and Ron Harper bucket that didn't beat the shot clock was counted) in a game they lost by 1 point? Any mention of the push off by Jordan - the blatant offensive foul? Nah. LMAO at this Jordan puff piece.  EDIT:   Lebron James is the GOAT. Hell, Kobe was better than Jordan."
LeBron James NEEDS a secondary creator. If you think LeBron plus no creators is winning a title against the 2018 Warriors you are deluded lmao

LeBron James vs Al O’pecia
LeBron James in his literal first playoff series: 35ppg on 60% true shooting
LeBron James in literally his first playoff run: 30ppg on 3% above league average efficiency
LeBron James at 24 years old in the playoffs:  35ppg on 61% true shooting
"Yeah, pretty easy to say ""organizations win championships"" when you inherit the greatest player in the history of the sport by far.  Krause was a great GM, but to act like the Bulls would've even won 1 championship if they didn't have MJ, which he didn't even draft, it's sillyness.  Every organization that is praised in today's game or in the past had an all-time great player, for example, the Spurs had Duncan and now the Warriors have Steph.  Organizations are important, but if you put LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard on the Knicks tomorrow, they are contenders regardless of the bullshit."
Yeah. LeDoctor Lebron James.
"Hakeem faces harder competition than dame lillard, Kobe Bryant, KD, Harden, Russ, d wade, bosh, and lebron James? Doubt it."
"&gt; Chris Bosh was nothing but a project &amp; nowhere near good enough to make an impediment impact like Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony etc. By the time he became a consistent 20 &amp; 10 guy, Vince was already past his prime.  Carter was ""way past his prime"" in 05-06 when Bosh put up 22.5/9.2 on good efficiency?  If that's true (it's not), I guess trying to move on from him in 04-05 would have been the right call, no?  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;And Bryan Colangelo was a awful GM who failed to build a decent supporting cast around Bosh.  Isn't the comment you're responding to directly about how in a year Colangelo had found enough pieces from nothing to build a 27-55 into a 47-35 team by building around Bosh, and won Executive of the Year as a result?  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Signed past prime &amp; injury riddled Jermaine O'Neal while essentially trading away Roy Hibbert,  1. Calling trading away the 17th pick in the draft ""trading away Roy Hibbert"" as if people knew in 2008 that he would turn into an all-star is just ridiculous. Would you be name dropping if the trade was with Alexis Ajinça or Marreese Speights instead?  2. O'Neal was 1 year removed from an all-star season, and *bounced back* the following year. He took a gamble that O'Neal would bounce back *and he was right* (but off by a year).  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Hedo Turkoglu and other scrubs.  I'm not even sure if you're complaining about signing Türkoğlu (who was the highest profile free agent the Raptors had signed up to that point) or trading him away when it was clear he wasn't a fit..."
"All of those teams you mentioned had way better front office &amp; supporting casts around their All-Stars.  Chris Bosh was nothing but a project &amp; nowhere near good enough to make an impediment impact like Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony etc. By the time he became a consistent 20 &amp; 10 guy, Vince was already past his prime.   And Bryan Colangelo was a awful GM who failed to build a decent supporting cast around Bosh. Signed past prime &amp; injury riddled Jermaine O'Neal while essentially trading away Roy Hibbert, Hedo Turkoglu and other scrubs."
"They should try to get Giannis. If they can fathom making a decent offer surrounding Alex Caruso and maybe a horse, i think they have a chance. Imagine! Lebron, Booker, Giannis and AD! God damn, holy mama's barbecue and divine spirit of black Muhhamad, James Dolan's gotta admit this is would be a better trade than Mike Tyson to Arsenal London!"
This made me spit out my water for some reason lmfao. Sounds more real than LeBron James
&gt;Imagine all the trouble we could avoid by just keeping our dang mouths shut!   LeBron James on Daryl Morey.
"I've seen Houston (and frankly D'antoni in general) have too many great teams that look unbeatable at times falter late. I'd say both Clips and Lakers win the series in 6. Could easily be 5 or 7, but either way, I dont think the Rockets take it.   Clippers vs Lakers:   Kawhi and Lebron both have playoff takeover capabilities so that reason alone makes this tough.   George and AD both are elite on both ends (obviously,) but AD to me is more consistent so I'm giving the Lakers the advantage just so slightly.   I think experience plays a huge role and though I'll take Doc over Vogel, the Lakers have three guys with a lot of experience with deep playoff runs (James, Rondo, Green) and the Clippers have one (Leonard.)   But yep, it's a coin flip. When both teams are that talented and with both teams playing really well before the break and then factoring in the actual break itself, all I can say is I really hope these two end up playing.   You didn't ask but I'm taking the winner of this series over Milwaukee/Toronto/Celtics all in 5 games. In my eyes, they're the two best teams.  But knowing how gritty the West is and how gritty the LA series would be, the east team will be far more rested. Would be fun to see Lebron face the adversity that he has had the luxury (not knocking him) of having the last decade."
Don't be fooled though. This does not mean LeBron is better than James Jones. Jones was just kind enough to let LeBron have the record.
You seem to think everybody wants to sign for less and take pay-cuts just to play in the Bay. By no means will Golden State be a contender with LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard in their conference.
"""At first blush, James comes across as craven, cynical, even — far more concerned with his own and the league’s bottom line than fundamental human rights. At worst, it seemed as if he was repackaging Chinese government propaganda about Westerners requiring a full history of the Qing Dynasty before weighing in (which, coincidentally, was the line billionaire Brooklyn Nets owner and Taiwan-born Alibaba founder Joe Tsai ran with last week).""  Did you even read the article you linked? Several times LeBron had the chance to clarify his comment but he insisted on Morey being misinformed and that he ""didn't have enough information"" to speak on Hong Kong. Stop slurping his dick."
"Nope, not true.  https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/what-did-lebron-james-say-about-china-nearly-everyone-else-ncna1069131"
"Ehlo is a better defender than JJ Barrea.    https://twitter.com/TheUndefeated/status/745717933561745408?s=20  https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/miamiheat/post/_/id/15298/lebron-james-winner-of-the-anti-flop-rules  - It's one of the most memorable images of the 2011 NBA Finals.  - LeBron James, all 6-foot-8 and 270 pounds of him, couldn't take advantage of J.J. Barea in the post. James tried backing down Barea, who weighed about 100 pounds less than James soaking wet   And tiny Jason Terry was guarding Lebron at times and other times it was 38yr old way his prime and a year from retirement Jason Kidd. Such great defensive players."
"Exactly. I really wish that the league would still award Finals MVP to the clear best player of the Finals, regardless of outcome. Jerry West is still the only player in NBA history to have this happen when in the first year of the award, 1969, when he averaged 38/5/7 on 49/-/84 against the Boston Celtics, who were led to win the championship by Havlicek's 28/11/4 on 46/-/85.  &amp;#x200B;  2014:  LeBron James: 28/8/4 on 57/52/79  FMVP Kawhi: 18/6/2 on 61/58/78  2015:  LeBron James: 36/13/9 on 40/31/69  FMVP Iguodala: 16/6/4 on 52/40/36"

Because the very same Lebron James betrayed democratic ideals when it wasn't convenient for him and when he could have said something.
What does Lebron James have to do with basketball?
Give us 1 AD and an unprotected LeBron James and we have a deal.
his dad is lebron james
"lebron and kawhi got theirs already, and giannis is still on the come up. the real answer imo is james harden."
"I think it's all just a ploy to undermine the influence of wealthy black people trying to speak up on black issues, personally.  Ali refused the draft, which is great, but not equitable to the Hong Kong issue at all. The only way this could be equitable is if LeBron James is from Hong Kong or possibly Taiwan and last I checked, Akron Ohio isn't in either of those places.   If I'm missing some example of him weighing in as a third party, and losing anything from it, I'd be glad to be proven wrong, but comparing his refusing to be conscripted in a pointless war by the people who are oppressing him is like comparing football to rugby."
"Rich privileged franchise that doesnt have to work hard for anything because of their history and weight of their name. For the past like 6-7 years the Lakers were an unequivocal joke and an embarrassment of an organization, slogging through a rebuild that netted them hardly any talent, yet they still got bailed out by having the at worst 2nd greatest player of all time in LeBron James sign with the Lakers because they're the Lakers. Trying to get into basketball and picking the Lakers as your team is practically like playing a game on the easiest difficulty. If you want to watch a team that you can count on to be pretty much always in the mix and that always attracts talent, then the Lakers are probably your best bet, but it's why everyone hates them so fucking much."
"KG is an all time great, no doubt, but the Defensive Goat is not as clear as the best shooter, or handler, or scorer...  Because AD is very similar to KG.  TD was a beast on the post.  Olajuwon was a master om defense  Ben Wallace was a pit bull...  The problem is, this is a team sport.  But recently Rip Hamilton recognized that Billups and himself weren't good defenders and Ben Wallace was the one who set the tone and anchored them.  And for me being able to ""defend"" prime Shaq...  And, to be honest, KG, even being strong, suffered with big heavy centers because he was so lean... On the other hand was quick enough as AD, with length to defend guards.  And also, LeBron for example had 4/5 years when he was defensevely crazy.  I remember one guy here saying... LeBron James won a game defending Denis Schroder one game, a super quick guard. Next game he did it defending a strong and explosive Blake Griffin, and then won another game defending 7'3 Porzingis.   And I also remember watching some Gary Payton and Pippen games when the other player... The only possibility that he have, was passing the ball. Not even advance one foot."
"Everything about this shit quote is wrong.   \- You can not underestimate Eric Spoelstra, yes he was undercoached by Rick Carlisle badly in 2011 but hey Rick Carlisle maybe best game changer coach in the league. Spo will make HOF and LeBron James had some big issues with him, the good thing is Pat Riley defend his coach and didn't listen LeBron. Spo is HOF caliber coach.  \- The league has changed. In 80's and 90's you can't just win without elite coaching. and coaching was much more important than current era. thats why Pat Riley, KC Jones, Chuck Daly, Phil Jackson and Rudy Tomjanovich dominated this eras. Just look at their superstars. Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Larry Bird, Kevin Mchale, Isıah Thomas, Michael Jordan,Scottie Pippen, Hakeem Olajuwon etc. You have to give some credit to them      these players enabled these coaches to have HOF careers. The oldest basketball figures in history put their ego aside and raised each other with their coaches. (you can argue Westhead, Fitch etc but they all lost their lockerooms.)  You have to credit for this players."
Imo LeBron James is a good player

I would say the Lakers. They have a great team led by a player who is in contention (controversial subject) for being the best player ever in Lebron James. His sidekick Anthony Davis joined the Lakers this past year and he made them immediate threats for the NBA championship. The complimentary pieces on this team were questioned at the beginning of the season but they proved everyone wrong and became one of the best teams in the league before the season was put on hold. They have great chemistry and play a (in my opinion) great form of basketball with incredible athleticism and smart passing.
NCAA can't say shit these days especially to the child of LeBron James. Nike would probably back him as well.
"I know the predominant opinion on this sub right now if you're still complaining about it is ""you're still mad so your opinion is invalid"" but I'm going to do it anyway. He had a couple of options  1. he could have just said absolutely fucking nothing, it would have cost him nothing to say absolutely nothing  2. he could have said ""as the president of the NBA players association I think it's best for me to say nothing"" and it would have been a perfectly legitimate cop-out, some people still wouldn't have liked it but it would basically be legitimate  3. he could have actually used his sway as an athlete, been ""more than an athlete"" and gotten some high-profile players, if not the league (I think Silver would have been behind it if the players wanted to do it), and stood against the PRC which is perhaps the biggest singular rising political threat to free society that us young people will face in our lifetimes  Instead he waited like a week and then said something inarticulate about one of the smartest and most well-educated people involved in the league and actively discouraged anyone else from speaking up. Ignorance was/is not a legitimate excuse, it was on national news almost daily for months prior to this point, and if Lebron James showed the slightest bit of interest in it he could've had people with PHDs on the subject that would have come to him and explain the issue in detail to him while he was icing his knees after working out. Would have cost him very little, all he had to do was give a shit and someone well-qualified would spoonfeed him this stuff.   AND THEN he comes along for the ride with Black Lives Matter protests for which (legitimately) a main point is that ""silence is being complicit"" and there is no excuse for doing nothing. And he starts taking these 0 PR risk stances and acting like he's a leader for change because he chimes in on this subject."
"It's not all or nothing, but it showed that when something that he said could affect his pocket, he backed down.  LeBron James speaking out/donating against police brutality and the hardships that the black community faces doesn't affect his money, it actually enhances it whether he wants it or not because it creates a better image of himself, which directly affects his endorsement deals.  Max Kellerman said it best, it's called selling out. It's very easy to make a stand when there's zero to low cost to yourself, but when the cost is high it's very hard and very few will do it.  Muhammad Ali spoke up when the cost was his own freedom, LeBron shut up when the cost was his money.  I'm not saying i would've behaved differently, but don't call yourself an activist or try to bring this image, but when you can really be affected by something you just go quiet, that's fake shit."
What is the ratio of Jayson Tatum booming LeBron James to LeBron stating how good Tatum is?   a: 5:3  b: 2:1  c: 1:4  d: 5:7
"Does it in this case? What has Kyrie done as the main guy on a team? Kyrie has been blessed with playing with LeBron James and then joining greatly run organizations. Wall played on the Wizards as the number 1 option and has done a lot more as the guy. Kyrie was leading garbage teams before LeBron came and getting run out of teams after. He's a great isolation scorer but what else does he do at a high level? Wall was a much better passer, defender, leader, whatever you want to add."
Lebron James
"Here I thought we were talking about basketball and actual basketball players. I guess arguing the topic is too much work?  But I do love how this thread somehow jumped from ""video of rookie bench warmer hangs with D2 player"" to people saying ""HS kids would beat WNBA all-stars."" Considering WNBA all-stars are very very significantly better than the player in question... and D2 players are better than almost all HS players... that's literally the most ridiculous logical leap I've ever seen.  Lexie Brown was good enough at this time to only play 5.6 minutes a game against the WNBA league as a whole, let alone all-stars... the logical jumps people make here are actually insane.  The still level at the top of the WNBA is far higher than the bottom of even that league, just like it is in the NBA. As per the original post, ""there are levels to this shit.""   That's like saying if some random D1 player beats NBA 1st round 14th pick Romeo Langford in a 1v1 on YT, that *of course*, D2 teams players could easily beat LeBron James. Because logic.  People on this forum are so insecure it's hilarious... and probably never even seen a WNBA all-star play in real life. (Or realize that the top players are like 6'4""-6'5"" 190 and not an undersized wing player like Lexie Brown and would post most of them up all day... Lexie Brown is the second shortest player on the Lynx. The guy in this video would have gotten his shit destroyed by a player like A'ja Wilson, for example.)"

"Or LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, two stars who are best with the ball and have questionable shooting abilities. There's only one ball!!!!!!! Makes no sense."
"I’d be curious what the metrics say but anecdotally, I’ve seen both James and Westbrook be extremely effective cutters.   LeBron played without the ball a lot in Miami and when he was at his best there, he did an excellent job of cutting while the ball was in the hands of Wade or Bosh. He’s been more ball-dominant since leaving Miami but he can still turn that part of his game on when he needs to.  And Westbrook has been really good this year seeking catch and finish opportunities when opponents look to trap Harden.  Wall has never displayed that level of activity."
A motivated Lebron James...A top 2 player ever...the greatest passer ever. Who has to win 17 for Kobe...Is probably the best player in basketball
"Frank Vogel, LeBron James and Rajon Rondo together.  Together on Lakers.  This sounds so wrong to me."

Most of these are from the last 2 years. I set Google to search 2007-2017 and there's a bunch more.  Again, I am a LeBron believer, but he holds franchises hostage and blames others for his failures and I don't think that's a hot take."
"It's not like he wasn't already special, but LeBron James' 2007 playoff game against the Pistons where he scored 29 of his team's final 30 points was probably the clearest case of we're-watching-greatness-unfold-before-our-eyes I'd ever seen up to that point.    Watching that game live... it literally felt like he couldn't be stopped. Single coverage? Burst and dunk. Double teamed? Fadeaway 3-pointer. Doubled and trapped? Some behind the back escape dribble I hadn't seen him use into stepback three. By the time the final play was drawn up, I'd never been so certain of a game-winner in my life. It wasn't a matter of whether he was going to make the shot, it was just a question of how he was going to choose to do it.   LeBron was already known to be a great player prior to that moment, but that performance, to me, instantly showed me that we were dealing with an all-time great. It didn't even feel like he was getting lucky. He was just achieving what he was capable of."
LeBron James  Anthony Davis  Zach LaVine  Just give them the rings for the next 5 years.
"Even in 2012, his peak, he only hit an eFG% of 44%. He never broke 50 in his whole career. His absolute best year he barely surpassed LeBron James' worst year at 43.8%. He just wasn't very good.  He might have some sick moves but more often than not he was missing."
"Play in playoffs and carry his team game away from WCF in maiden playoffs. His historic playoff debut is only bested by Oscar Robertson, LeBron James, and Wilt Chamberlain. He was also honored as a 1st team All-NBA player. Considering the way he has been carrying the Nuggets last two years, being top1/2 seed most of that time against greatest superteam ever, I'd say its very disrespectful to actually consider Doncic having better NBA resume than Jokic. What did Doncic accomplish in NBA to be considered better than Nikola?"
Curry Paul George  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James Giannis Antetokounpo   This lineup is as good as it gets.
"they looked more human because Lebron played like James Posey in the series, it was entirely his fault"
"First off, the first paragraph i highly doubt is true. Second, it’s not ONE PLAY! Third, I never in my life said Lebron James is inconsistent in offense. I think I did in Defense, if so I regret saying those exact words. Fourth, I can say the same for Anthony Davis."
"I’m sadly okay with this. Just not the fucking lakers. Can’t stand the influx of lebronners that wear the laker flair AND dare disrespect Kobe while they have a lakers flair on just to pump up lebron.  If clippers don’t win I want the Rockets to win ( won’t be super excited or anything, but they deserve it). James Harden is a baller and Im confident he would have won if CP3 didn’t go down.  I just don’t like Westbrook but whatever."
Lakers and because of a man named Lebron James
They have Lebron James and Anthony Davis two great mobile defenders and the Lakers clog the paint forcing Giannis to shoot...They are both pretty complete
"I'm sure he thinks that Lakers team was his peak. [He also believes that he should have been MVP every year](https://lakersnation.com/lakers-great-shaquille-oneal-compares-himself-to-lebron-james-in-mvp-voting/2017/03/27/), and the only reason he wasn't is voter fatigue.  &gt;LeBron [James] and myself are similar,” O’Neal told SI.com earlier this month in Atlanta. “We could be MVP every year. But [the voters] don’t give it every year and he’s already got four. [I should have won] three, easily. Kobe should have won three, too. [I should have won] the two that Steve Nash got over me. It pisses me off. [Nash] knows.”  From his overly simplistic PoV, where scoring is virtually all that matters, I can see why he singles out Nash's MVP's."
"Mike Miller is not only a great basketball player he's just a good dude. I used to bartend at a hotel in LA that houses many NBA teams, one of them being the Cavs. When Mike was on the team and he was at the hotel, he would come to my bar every night and drink red wine, sometimes with team personnel (asst. coaches, trainers, etc.). But he was the coolest dude ever and super nice. He would seek me out and made sure I served him. ""_DirtyYoungMan_ you a legend. You legendary."", everytime I gave him another glass. They beat the Lakers one night and were eating out on the closed patio that was reserved for the Cavs. I asked the waitress if I could help her carry some food after I was done closing up because I wanted to see LeBron in person, she obliged. I get there with the plate of food and Mike Miller see's me, points at me and says what's up and asks how I'm doing (I felt pretty special TBH). I ask him if they won. He says yes and I congratulated him for which he thanked me. Then I say, ""Goodluck tomorrow against the Clippers... cuz you're gonna need it."" He erupted in laughter along with about half the team. He was sitting next to LeBron and King James sat looking back and forth between the two of us trying to figure why the bartender was talking shit to his teammate. It's a moment in my life I'll never forget; I rendered the greatest basketball player in the world speechless and made Mike Miller laugh his ass off."
"LeBron, 3 shooters, and an athletic pick &amp; roll big.  In 2003 Sacramento had the shooters, but lacked the elite big man unless I'm forgetting someone on that team. Dallas would probably have been the best team for him to have landed on at that time.  Steve Nash / Michael Finely / LeBron James / Antawn Jamison / Dirk Nowitzki"
"So you think if Lebron wasn't a factor, they wouldn't be doing this? In your world, do they only care about money because Lebron James exists?"
LeBron James
"They’re certainly up there. A few others who should be considered are:  Magic with prime Dwight (2009) Jameer Nelson, JJ Redick, Turkoglu, Rashard Lewis, Courtney Lee  2017 Cavs: Kyrie, JR Smith, Kyle Korver, Channing Frye, Kevin Love, James Jones, Lebron, Richard Jefferson"
Agreed. But you also have to be better offensively than Jason Kidd was in 2011 to win a championship in today's NBA. The days when teams won championships with one superstar and a bunch of just very good players as a supporting cast are probably over.   That said defensively you can have some doubts if CP3 will age as well as J Kidd did due to the size difference (Kidd is 6ft4). Kidd was still able to lock down LeBron James alongside Shawn Marion at age 38. CP3 is a stellar defender but I don't see him quite on that level in three years.
Comparing him to Lebron is gonna lead to a lot of disappointment. He’s his own player. Extremely high iq for the game at his young age. He’s not NBA level at anything at this point and really no 14 year old in the world should be. Also where are you seeing all these 14 year old Lebron James clips? Because I can’t find any.

"&gt; Stop. Y'all wanted the black man to entertain you, make you laugh, make you cry, and speak on all political and social issues.  I appreciate that racial tensions are high over there, but I do not appreciate this insinuation that I am a racist for pointing out facts that don't fit your narrative.    &gt;How exactly did LeBron stan for the Chinese government?   If you're not actually aware of what he said, it would be wise to actually do some research and find out before getting mad.    &gt;“I don’t want to get into a … feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke,” James said before the Lakers hosted the Golden State Warriors in a preseason game. &gt; &gt;“I’m not here to judge how the league handled the situation,” James said. “When you’re misinformed or not educated about something, and I’m just talking about the tweet itself, you never know the ramifications that can happen.   Dude calls out Morey as 'misinformed and not educated' about the HK situation.  He did later try to walk it back after there was anger around his comments, but shit, those initial comments were pretty clear.    A bunch of other people made non comments, and no one remembered that shit a few months later.  Lebron's comments were remembered, and rightly criticized, because instead of the bland 'no comment' everyone expected he fucking decided to go in on Morey.    &gt; How was it any worse than any other head of a corporation or a head of a state?   Other heads of corporations / states generally did not put down someone for expressing support for the HK movement.  So yeah, it was worse.    &gt;How do you pop shit about what's going on and you're not even on the ground?  I have no idea what the fuck you're even referring to here tbh.  Are you referring to my commenting on American race relations when I'm not physically there?  Because I'd then ask the same question about Lebron commenting on HK.    &gt;Where's the sustained crucifixion of Adam Silver?  Silver, to my knowledge, has not directly criticized Morey's support for HK, and in fact resisted demands from China to fire Morey.    &gt; Didn't see anyone else riding for Lebron and the black community when they were protesting for Tamir Rice.  I mean, let's take a look at that.    Imagine if someone not directly involved w/ the black community in the US tweeted 'Justice for Tamir Rice'.  Cool, right?  Now imagine if someone else had attacked the person who tweeted that, and called them ignorant and misinformed.  Not cool, no?  Well shit, Lebron basically did the latter.    &gt;Honestly y'all can miss me with the faux outrage.   Man, you're expecting outsiders to support the BLM movement but you're standing there showing absolutely no sympathy for the HK protesters?  That's a shit attitude.    &gt;Denigrate the black man  Shit, you keep making it about Lebron's race.  IDGAF that he's black, I care that he stanned for the CCP.  Dude could be black, white, asian, latino, fucking eskimo, whatever, it was a bitch move.    &gt;not speaking up on issues that don't directly affect him but do nothing about issues that do impact him.  Again, the issue isn't that he 'did nothing'.  It was about him fucking siding with the bad guys."
"&gt;Do you not think second seed in the most competitive western conference in a decade with Jamal Murray as a second option atleast puts him equal to LeBron who has another MVP candidate himself.  I have common sense so no, not at all. Stop being silly, Jokic is not nearly as valuable as LeBron freaking James.  By the way they’re the 3rd seed, not 2nd."
"As an Asian man, Lebron caught shit not because he gave a lukewarm take on China but because he went after Daryl Morey for tweeting support for HK.   Steve Kerr gave a lukewarm take. James Harden gave a lukewarm take. No one's still criticizing either of those men. Lebron straight up stanned for the CCP. *That's* the issue there.   And fwiw BLM is obviously an issue nearer and dearer to his heart than HK. I lost respect for Bron over the China stanning, but shit, his support for this is clearly sincere."

"I would be absolutely shocked if Luka is shooting 39-40% on high volume from 3 in a couple of years. Luka’s shooting splits so far are very similar to young LeBron and his shot selection is similar of current James harden (paint or 3, no mid range, lots of dribbles and step backs). I am not saying he’s a bad player or anything, just that people see him make the sexy step backs and think he’s an elite shooter which just is not the case. Luka just is not a good set shooter, weather it’s free throws or catch’n’shoot 3’s, and for him to have any chance at being an all time great shooter those have to go up a significant amount which you very rarely see"
Why is the coach LeBron James  I'd lean towards team two
"I doubt it. With all due respect, he’s not that talented (plz don’t underestimate the nba professional level) especially in terms of physicality. Ppl sometimes glorify his natural talents too much coz of his papa who is LeBron James"
"Look at ur Steve Nash analogy, Nash might be dominated in the post by a hs football player, but is Nash going to lose a one on one against that hs player. No. Nash is gnna over power him based on his athleticism (quickness, speed, agility, stamina and endurance) plus his skill.  That's what I'm saying. We're not talking about a fight, we're talking about a one on one. An active WNBA player is going to be in prime athletic shape... She has access to the best athletic systems and is paid to use them. She's not going to lose to a hs athlete no matter how strong he is on a basketball court unless that hs player is like a lebron James type straight to the Nba type. And those types would be your average male collegiate player as well.  Women's basketball is a thing, every division 1 college has a girl's team. Yet there are only 144 Wnba jobs in the world, so these girls arent just picked off the street. They've devoted to their craft. Not just in skill but their bodies as well.  Here's another way to look at it, every college basketball player who makes it to the league always remarks the same thing - they can't believe how much more stronger everyone is. It's because the Nba pays these guys to be in the best shape of their lives, best basketball shape specifically. The same goes for the Wnba players. A hs football player isn't going to have the same athletic focus of a Hs basketball player. A everyday athlete isn't going to have the athleticism on a basketball court as a Wnba player. Full stop.  And I'm a dude, and I've played against girls, and even if I felt I can push them around, didn't change the fact that they could mop the floor with me with a billion jukes, in and outs and well timed dropped shoulders into my chest before splashing jumpers."
Lebron James
"It was double or quits for LeBron James.  That day, he moved on to the next dimension.  He came out a winner that day. In the face of total adversity, he outdid himself.  Behind it, he went on to win his first NBA title."
Kinda surprised haven't seen this one yet - LeBron James
"And I disagree. These critiques on KDs defense didn’t come until he complained about his narratives not fitting (as he should have). When he’s locked in, he’s clearly a great defender all around. Did a good job when he was on Harden in the Rockets series, and seemed took on the assignment of LeBron James. Still much better than Dirk no matter how you slice it. Better scorer better defender better passer better player"
"100%. He’s a known milker. Also was probably trying to lift the importance of the free throws. “Wow lebron james knocked down two free throws to seal the game, INJURED!”"
[LeBron James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEofHj27I3s). The man flys like he got shot.
"""Lebron James really is good "" - dude who has never seen a basketball game thinking this was LBJ"
Stephen Curry.  Michael Jordan.  LeBron James.  Kevin Garnett.  Shaquille O'Neal.
His name is LeBron James Jr. but he goes by Bronny
Elimination Game James or Game 7 Lebron. Absolute unit in those situations when his back is against the wall
"What advanced metrics? I'm genuinely curious. The only advance metric I know is offensive rating, and the [2017 Cavs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2017.html#all_misc) had the [best playoff offensive rating of all time](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/06/01/cavaliers-hiding-unimpressive-defense-behind-record-setting-playoff-offense/).  Here's what [Steve Kerr](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/28/steve-kerr-says-warriors-were-at-their-best-in-2017-no-question/) had to say:  &gt;Q: What stands out about that Finals series to you?  “I think that was the highest level of basketball I’ve ever seen in my life. I just thought that was Cleveland’s best team of the four years that we faced them. I thought they were much better that year than they were the previous year when they beat us in seven. Obviously, we were a lot better as well, adding Kevin Durant to the mix and being fully healthy and motivated and ready to go. So the level of play was just astounding. Particularly at the offensive end.  “You know, that was, to me, when everything sort of came to a head in terms of where the game had been heading from a spacing standpoint and a position-less standpoint. We got to a point in that series where LeBron was basically playing the five — playing up like a point center, and he’s the biggest guy on the floor for them. And they had four shooters around him, and he would just penetrate and they had such great spacing that you had to honor everybody, and he could just get right to the rim.  “So it was terrifying trying to defend them. It was terrifying for them to try to defend us too.”  &gt;Q: When you say that was the best of LeBron’s Cavs teams, was it because of what you were just talking about, or was there something else?  “I think there’s always another level for a championship team to reach the following season because there’s a new, deeper sense of confidence that didn’t exist. Once you win your first title, there’s such a deep level of confidence that it takes you to a new level. So just like us in ’16 after winning the title in ’15, we were way better in ’16. Even though we didn’t end up winning the championship, we were a much better team than we were in ’15. I thought the same thing was true for Cleveland. They had broken through and they were playing with that kind of championship swagger. They believed they could do it, they were fully healthy and they were a great, great team. But we had the ultimate weapon in Kevin, and nobody had an answer for him.”   - - -   The numbers agree with Steve Kerr:  &gt;Maybe we should give their offense a little more credit. Its carrying a historic load.  &gt;The Cavaliers are scoring 123.2 points per 100 possessions in the playoffs – on pace to smash the record in the 16-team postseason format (enacted in 1984). The difference between Cleveland’s offensive rating and No. 2 (1987 Lakers, 120.3) is greater than the difference between No. 2 and No. 11.  &gt;In simplest terms, the Cavs offense is built around LeBron James. If single-covered, he scores. If double-teamed, he passes to usually-open, usually-good 3-point-shooting team. Mix in Kyrie Irving‘s isolations, Kevin Love‘s outside-inside game and Tristan Thompson‘s offensive rebounding, and it’s just too much for opponents to handle.  &gt;The Cavaliers have made 43% of their 3-pointers and 56% of their 2-pointers and generated 27 free-throw attempts per game this postseason.  &gt;Their playoff offensive rating is 14.4 points better than the regular-season league average. That scoring has propped up a playoff defense at the regular-season league average."
"I don't know why so many people are taking offense to the fact that the 2017 Cavs were a [dynastic offense](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2017.html#all_misc). They have the [best playoff offensive rating of all time](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/06/01/cavaliers-hiding-unimpressive-defense-behind-record-setting-playoff-offense/).   &gt;Maybe we should give their offense a little more credit. Its carrying a historic load.  &gt;The Cavaliers are scoring 123.2 points per 100 possessions in the playoffs – on pace to smash the record in the 16-team postseason format (enacted in 1984). (Note, after the Finals the Cavs' offensive rating dipped to 120.3, which is still comfortably higher than the 2nd-ranked '87 Lakers 119.9, and the 3rd ranked '17 Warriors 119.0, according to Basketball Reference.)  &gt;In simplest terms, the Cavs offense is built around LeBron James. If single-covered, he scores. If double-teamed, he passes to usually-open, usually-good 3-point-shooting team. Mix in Kyrie Irving‘s isolations, Kevin Love‘s outside-inside game and Tristan Thompson‘s offensive rebounding, and it’s just too much for opponents to handle.  &gt;The Cavaliers have made 43% of their 3-pointers and 56% of their 2-pointers and generated 27 free-throw attempts per game this postseason.  &gt;*Their playoff offensive rating is 14.4 points better than the regular-season league average.** That scoring has propped up a playoff defense at the regular-season league average.     The reason those Cavs didn't win was because of **their horrendous defense**, they finished 29th in the league. **29th.** 2nd-worst in the entire league.   Can you expect the 29th worst defense in the league to even have a *chance* of handling the KD Warriors' [own historically good offense](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2017.html#all_misc), which ranked as the 3rd-best playoff offense ever? No, no you wouldn't. And... they didn't.    &gt;So much attention has been paid to the Cavaliers’ Swiss-cheese defense – for good reason.  &gt;If the Cavs win the title, **Cleveland’s defense in the regular season would the worst or second-worst (in the running with the 2000-01 Lakers) for an eventual NBA champion.** Cleveland allowed 115.5 points per 100 possessions to a middling Pacers in the first round – the worst defensive rating in a four-game sweep since at least 1984, as far back as Basketball-Reference records go. The Cavaliers clamped down against the Raptors in the second round, but Toronto’s offense falls apart in the playoffs annually. Against the Celtics in the conference finals, Cleveland looked its worst defensively after Isaiah Thomas got hurt and Boston switched to an equalitarian style that more closely resembles the Warriors.     The 2017 Warriors had their 2nd-best offensive series of the entire playoffs against the Cavs' swiss-cheese defense, putting up an insane **121.3** offensive rating in the [Finals](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2017-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html). The only team the Warriors had a higher offensive rating against were the hapless [2017 Spurs without Kawhi](basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2017-nba-western-conference-finals-spurs-vs-warriors.html), who they put up a stupid 122.2 ortg against. They had a 116 and 117 ortg against the Jazz and Blazers.  ---  Meanwhile, the Warriors were also an extremely elite **defensive team** that ranked [2nd on defense](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2017.html#all_misc_stats), both in the regular season and the [playoffs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2017.html#all_misc). That's **2nd best**, by the way, not 2nd worst. Pair the 2nd best offense and the 2nd best defense and you have one of the best teams ever, the math isn't very hard.   This was peak DPOY Draymond Green, with KD bought into the system and Iggy close to his Finals MVP self. They were more than up to the challenge of slowing down even that historic Cavs juggernaut of an offensive side - they ""only"" put up a [114.8 offensive rating](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2017-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html) in the Finals against the Warriors elite defense.   (Note, this slowed-down, oxidised version of the 2017 Cavs offense in the Finals, 114.8 ortg, against an elite defense, was still **[better than the 2018 champion Warriors overall playoff ortg](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2018.html#all_misc)**, better than the **[2016 73-win warriors offense](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2016.html#all_misc)**, better than the **[2015 champion warriors offense](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2015.html#all_misc)**, and only slightly behind the historic **[2019 warriors offense](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2019.html#all_misc)**)"
"Not only can LeBron not play a fast break style at his age, he is also one of the worst off-ball superstars I've ever seen. It's almost as bad as James Harden."
complete lebron james playoff highlights would probably be like a 2 hour video
How has nobody mentioned the Kevin Durant/LeBron James charge/offensive foul reviewed and still incorrect that lost the Cavs a playoff game. The NBA has to apologize for the egregiousness of the play call.

dude he only has hype because he’s lebron James son lol He would get chewed up and spit out in euro league rn... if he was playing college ball this up coming season he would get no playing time and if he did he must’ve gone to an ass school .. and he’s prolly not even a top 20 high school player
Lebron James jr ? Lmao absolutely not
"Mikey Williams, Lebron James Jr, Emomi Bates, Lamelo Ball, Michael Jordan"
"&gt; 4. LeBron James and Erik Spoelstra (2012-2014) whose switch to small ball was both very public and successful (happened in the middle of the 2012 playoffs). They also beat the Thunder in the finals largely because of the Thunder's refusal to switch to small-ball (providing a very public stage for how effective small ball was).  It also helped a lot when Shane Battier caught fire early in the series and had that shooting touch for the rest of the Finals. With him and Miller going hot from deep, they looked like Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling in Arizona against the Yankees in the World Series."
"Superstars are guys who can credibly lead a team to the conference finals or further or someone who does something statistically phenomenal.   The cut off point is probably russ.  But dame isn't even a definite top 5 pg. Curry, Kyrie, Russ, Kemba Walker, Kyle Lowry. I mean Dame would probably go 4th in that list but also portland are missing the playoffs and Kyle Lowry won a ring last year. Lebron has also been playing PG this year, Doncic, Trae Young, James Harden are all players who I would take at the PG position ahead of Dame ahead of dame (or about the same in the case of young)."
Yup that him LeBron James has never made an all star game in his career.

"Jimmys defense that series was ELITE. It never gets brought up but he held lebron to 39% from the feild 10%!!!! From 3 and almost 5 turnovers a game that series. JR smith, james jones, kyrie, and iman shumpert being lights out from 3 is mostly why we lost. Its hard to blame gasol being out since they didnt have love but we definitely lost confidence after game 4 especially rose who looked completely out of it in the last 2 games after making the game winner in game 3 and a layup to tie it in game 4(underrated clutch ass play that will be forgotten unfortunately) . While i do think we beat Cleveland if that call js made i dont know if us beating atlanta would be as easy as you think we struggled against them in the regular season."
"“LeBron James, with no regard for human life!!”"
"All things considered Hair Gordan has actually looked pretty good this year. IIRC 17/6/4 on good efficiency, just nowhere near LeBron James/Steph Curry Money"
"[Yeah, because he thought Oscar was the GOAT](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1798248-kareem-abdul-jabbar-oscar-robertson-better-than-michael-jordan-and-lebron-james)."
"You're calling Kevin Love a superstar lmao hilarious - or did you mean all star?    Because it's kinda crazy MJ won 0 chips without 2 all stars on his team as well.    Let's take a look at Kareem's chips too....  So first one he had Oscar fucking Robertson and Bob Dandridge, two all stars.  First with the Lakers he had Magic and Silk, two all stars.  Second with the Lakers he still had Magic and Silk and he had Bob McAdoo fucking backing him up for half the games lmao  The third they have Magic, Silk, McAdoo, and they pick up James Worthy and a shout out to the never all star but 16 PPG first team all rookie Byron Scott  The next two chips they don't have Silk or McAdoo but they keep Magic and Worthy and pick up a one time all star AC Green.  Kareem is outscored by Magic, Scott, and Worthy during these 2 runs and Kareem averages  14 points and 6 boards a game during the last championship run.    I didn't even mention Michael Cooper who was on all of these teams because he wasn't an all star but he was a multiple time Defensive Team Winner and 1 time DPOY.  You're talking about Lebron needing stacked teams to win chips?  How many teams can you name that aren't stacked that win a chip?  The Pistons?"
"I can understand the arguments about pace, but if you have a player with a LeBron-like skill set (with some James Harden thrown in), why wouldn't you build your entire offense around him? The same approach has been shown to be very successful before."
Lebron James
"was hoping someone would do this. i *can't stand* that harper article. for one, listing these as separate criteria is middle school writing:  &gt;* How much did he bring to the franchise?   &gt;* Did he help bring championships to that franchise?   &gt;* Did he ruin things for the franchise?    and there is ZERO logic where you can put alcindor, magic, lebron and duncan in that order. this is what harper does:  1) alcindor: he didn't do that much with the bucks, but his accolades are outstanding.   2) johnson: not as great a player, but brought so much to the lakers.   3) james: didn't do as much for cleveland as magic did for LA, but his win for cleveland was one of the biggest ever. he is also a better player than anyone on the list.   4) duncan: gave the spurs more than any player gave their team.    so like, what the fuck is that? if alcindor is above johnson, why is james not? if johnson is above james, why is duncan not (and why is johnson above duncan, given what he said about each of them)? it's the worst article i've ever seen on the athletic, and i think yours is actually much *more* well thought out, because harper either did not have a consistent thought process, or he refused to make it clear. yours is an infinitely better list imo.  edit: i stopped reading there but apparently he pulls the same thing with shaq above hakeem. zero logic.  the fucking ""sir this is a wendy's"" joke in lebron's writeup is also the most /r/fellowkids shit i've ever seen in professional writing of any form. embarrassing."
"He flops https://youtu.be/LpUGYNHtsfA  He complains to the refs alot   The school lebron payed 2 million but Akron residents payed 8 million in taxes to it https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2018/08/whos_paying_for_lebron_james_n_1.html  https://www.golfdigest.com/story/lebron-james-10-most-passive-aggressive-social-media-moments hes super passive aggressive saying otherwise is the lie   Lebron yells at everyone teammates, family, coaches https://youtu.be/eRDqrhb6HeU  There are actually alot of reasons to not like him"
"If people truly understood how great LeBron and Curry are as offensive players, this wouldn't even be a question. KD, Klay and CP are miles below in terms of building an offense around them. LeBron and Curry are 2 of the top 5, and arguably of the top 3, offensive centerpieces ever. Durant, Klay and Paul on a team would be an awesome team and win a championship. LeBron James and Steph Curry would be the greatest team of all time."
you can also have the opinion that ben simmons is better than lebron james and noone can take that away from you. that doesnt change that its a stupid take and you are wrong
LeBron is respected. George Hill once said the only person scarier than LeBron was God.  [https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/george-hill-lebron-james-god/188869](https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/george-hill-lebron-james-god/188869)
"I was inspired to make this thread because of the mass amount of comments recently surrounding the GOAT debate. Let me just say, that in my opinion, LeBron James is the greatest player of all-time. That being said, I understand a lot of people disagree with that and that is completely fine. We are all entitled to our own opinion. Whether you believe it's MJ or it's LeBron, I think there is a great case to be made for each player. But if you have MJ as your GOAT and you don't have LeBron as your clear-cut #2, then you're doing yourself and the game a disservice. Now if you already have LeBron cemented in your top 2 (and it seems a good majority of people already do) then this thread isn't for you. This thread is for the people who seem to be living in a bubble when it comes to looking at the career of LeBron James. I'm looking at you Michael Wilbon and Charles Barkley. Wilbon has said he has LeBron James in his top 5, while Barkley, as most recently as 2016, said LeBron will never be a top 5 player of all-time. Now whether Barkley has changed his stance on that comment, I'm not sure, but considering there is no love lost between Barkley and LeBron, I'm willing to bet he still stands by that assessment. Those are just two examples of national basketball voices who are completely disrespecting the career of LeBron James. I didn't make this thread because of their opinions, since most people don't give a fuck what Barkley has to say and we all know Wilbon is a huge Chicago homer, but I made this thread because of a good number of comments I see on this forum from people hesitant to put LeBron in their top 2. THERE SHOULDN'T BE A SINGLE OUNCE OF HESITATION. There is ABSOLUTELY no debate on who the top 2 players are in the history of the game. You have Michael Jordan and you have LeBron James. However you want to rank those two is a different story but when you start putting other guys ahead of LeBron all I can do is laugh. How can I legitimately sit there and take you seriously when the majority of this forum is under the age of 35? Now if you've watched either Wilt or Kareem, please come forward. But at a certain point people argue for Wilt or Kareem just to have a different opinion. Maybe they hate LeBron that much that they can't process what they are witnessing. You're talking about a player that is on the verge of 7 straight finals appearances. You're talking about a player that has 3 rings and 4 MVPs at the age of 32. You're talking about a player that put up 41, 41, and a triple-double in back-to-back-to-back games in the greatest finals performance of all-time to help bring his team back for the win against a 73-9 Warriors team. You're talking about a player that has another ring against a Spurs team that has been the best franchise in the NBA for the past two decades. No disrespect to Jordan but he never once beat a team as good as the Warriors or the Spurs. You're talking about a player who has 10 playoff sweeps in his career at the young age of 32. By the way, the Lakers as a franchise have 13 playoff sweeps in their entire franchise history. You're talking about a player who is already top 7 in all-time career points. You're talking about a player who is the only non-guard in the top 25 for all-time career assists. You're talking about a player who will finish as the all-time postseason record holder for points. He will also finish top 5 for all-time postseason rebounds and assists. You're talking about a player who has averaged over 25+ppg, 6+rpg, and 6+apg for 13 straight seasons. 13 STRAIGHT SEASONS WTF? LeBron James is the best all around player of all-time. He has also played in arguably the most competitive and talented era of all-time. No disrespect to Wilt but playing in an era with anywhere from 8 to 17 teams does not impress me. Also, when you're averaging nearly 20-25 more possessions a game and playing against seriously inferior talent, no shit your stats are going to be insanely inflated. Also, as far as Kareem goes, the 70s is one of the weakest decades of basketball in the history of the game. So next time you're having a conversation with someone and they don't at least have LeBron in their top 2, just end the conversation right there because they aren't worth talking to. The way LeBron James career has been taken for granted is a travesty. We are witnessing one of the best professional players in any sport of all-time. This is a player you will tell your grandkids stories about. You'll walk them through games of him putting a dagger in the hearts of his opponents. By the time his career is all said and done, he will be the greatest player to even lace them up."

"Rondo and Mark Jackson were both all stars and Andre Miller was definitely not a role player. Since 2000 you have LeBron, Westbrook(2x), James Harden, Chris Paul (4x), Steve Nash (5x), Rondo (3x), Jason Kidd (3x), and Andre Miller. Role players??? 😂"
1) LeBron James  2) Anthony Davis  3) Kentavious Caldwell Pope  4) Danny Green  5) Avery Bradley
LeBron James misses a 3 point fga?
"Yeah, these Celtics have been terrible.  * [The other day Perkins was talking about a potential Chris Paul trade that nearly went down a decade ago.](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/5/14/21259028/lakers-chris-paul-trade-not-vetoed-what-if-kobe-bryant-dwight-howard-lebron-james-anthony-davis-chaz) Can you imagine a team like the Lakers talking about a potential Chris Paul trade a decade after the fact?  * [Then there is all the beef these guys had.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaq%E2%80%93Kobe_feud) Can you imagine if Shaq and Kobe had drama and then didn't stop talking about it for like 10-20 years?  * Then there are all the hot takes about [Lebron vs Kobe](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/fans-agree-with-shaq-in-their-primes-kobe-bryant-better-than-lebron-james-060415), [hypothetical what-ifs](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/01/07/shaq-talks-kobe-two-on-two-vs-lebron-kobe) and [who is the GOAT](https://www.si.com/nba/lakers/news/shaquille-oneal-says-kobe-bryant-needs-to-be-included-in-goat-conversation-with-michael-jordan). I mean, we hear about that enough as it is.  Shit, as a Laker fan you have to be really glad you don't have a team that drones on about past events, I'm really jealous of you."
He does have the most missed FGs all time.  1.  Kobe Bryant - 14481 2.  John Havlicek - 13417 3.  Elvin Hayes - 13296 4.  Karl Malone - 12682 5.  Dirk Nowitzki - 12565 6.

"And Pierce isn't saying he himself was ever better than Lebron either. He's saying Jordan and Kareem and a coupe others are, with some very valid points. Rather than being like every other talking head doing public fellatio of James because its popular."
"Bronny James will have won an MVP to help give LeBron one more championship getting exactly 23 points, 6 rebounds and 8 assists to match LeBron's now number of championships in every playoff game."
"If LeBron James had been facing his most dominant opponent (warriors) every path to the title for the first 3/4 of his career, how many championships would he have won? Well, the 60’s Celtics were even *more* dominant for their era and Wilt still did manage to win in the most dominant run in NBA history at the time. Later in his career, when the Celtics were rebuilding, he won yet again, but with a team he made even more unstoppable than from his last victory.  Were Jordan and LeBron never the best in the world until they won a title? Was Kareem not the best player of the 1970s because he only won a single championship in the decade?  Put it this way: between the team with the best player vs the better team, which would you bet on in a seven game series?"
[73% of nba players think Jordan is goat. ](https://www.sportscasting.com/michael-jordan-or-lebron-james-who-do-nba-players-think-is-the-goat/)
Why are you saying he definitely SHOULDNT ? If you’re saying his numbers are a little worse and they treat Grant like he was the first LeBron James or Scottie why should he for sure not get in? Right on the border I can agree with but DEFINITELY NOT is absurd
"Lebron got plants all over the league bruh, David griffin LeBrons former gm gets hired by the pelicans and then Davis gets traded to the lakers not even 3 months later. James Jones got hired by the suns because of Lebron too perhaps to try and get booker to the lakers in a blockbuster trade. Keep in mind devin booker is now dating Los Angeles supermodel Kendall jenner (devin booker might force his way out soon if the suns don’t start winning) my theory is that James Jones and klutch sports got the booker trade already lined up in case the Bradley Beal to nets trade happens"
"Kendrick Perkins, Richard Jefferson, Channing frye, and now draymond all mouth pieces for klutch sports and lebron. Remmeber that zoom 2 weeks back with Frye, allie, Jefferson and Lebron. Jefferson slipped up and said,” I’m not trying to get fired by ESPN.” Lebron then responded, “ESPN won’t fire you, you are my friend.” No player has taken more abuse from the LeNarrative than James Harden. If Giannis and luka weren’t with Nike they would be slandered by the media too"
"Idk if this fits with revisionist history but alas: That Lebron James not being favored (by the odds?) this past decade in most of his title runs excuses him from his loses. When in fact he has played with great players for a decade and was always discussed as if they should win the title.   2011,12,13,14,16 all should’ve resulted in title wins, but he lost ‘11 (he folded) and ‘14 (D Wade got old quick and Lebron/Spoelstra didn’t utilize Bosh well). In other words, he had everything at his disposal to win 5 titles in 6 years, but he underachieved.   Also, Shaq not being considered the great player that he is. He’s the only player in nba history that gets looked down upon for just winning 4 titles (5 appearances in 7 years) yet I remember he was discussed as the most dominating player in nba history. Yet, nowadays he’s discussed as if he’s not a top 10 player ever. Meanwhile, Kobe also gets docked points for playing with Shaq because Shaq is so great...which one is it? Shaq is greater than Kobe or Kobe and Shaq can coexist (like Magic and Kareem do) as great players on top 10 list of all time? It’s weird, back in the day they would simply accept both as the greatest of their day (alongside Duncan) but nowadays it feels like a battle to even put Shaq on a top ten list, as well as, having Kobe right alongside him on those lists."
"Yeah, it's not like teams were on the phone going ""Who is it? LeBron James? Oh no, we don't want him"". He could've gone to basically any team that could afford him (and I don't remember who those teams were at the time) but he chose to go to Cleveland"
"How many players from the original 50 greatest players list is Paul Pierce better than?  With that question in mind, here are the following players not on that list that I'll take over Pierce in no particular order:  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kobe Bryant  Kevin Garnett   Tim Duncan   Dirk Nowitzki  D Wade  Steph Curry  Giannis (possibly too soon)  Dennis Rodman  Allen Iverson  Gary Payton  Jason Kidd  Steve Nash  Kawhi Leonard  James Harden  Chris Paul  Antony Davis (possibly too soon)"
LeBron James  Michael Jordan  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Magic Johnson  Wilt Chamberlain  Larry Bird  Shaquille O'Neal  Bill Russell  Kobe Bryant  Tim Duncan  Kevin Durant  Scottie Pippen  Kawhi Leonard  Steph Curry  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Kevin Garnett  Allen Iverson  Charles Barkley
"I said he’s not as clutch as he’s made out to be. I still think he’s clutch, but there are quite a few players I’d pick to shoot a jumper with a playoff game on the line over Lebron James"
"Outlet passes are faster and more time efficient than an actual player bringing the ball up, but are very situational and prone to turnover. This isnt highschool or 2k where outet passes work every time you run the break. NBA players with NBA length, reflexes and defensive IQ and positioning will pick off that outlet pass more often than not, and few players, especially bigs, are capable of making full-court reads and making an accurate pass that isnt getting picked off. Not every team has a Kevin Love, and half of his outlets work because it's Lebron James running and making the catch."
"I imagine a lot of fans thinking ""No! It's LeBron James, no! Not this guy! Ahhh!! OMG!!!""  https://youtu.be/vv2HR5dbZXU"
"Probably more. If you asked this question in 10 years ago, only LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Steph Curry would have been active in 2010 and guys like Steph and Harden were rookies. Very few people would have predicted they'd be top 10 guys in 2020.   Top 10 in 2020 features Kawhi, Giannis, Luka, Nikola, Dame, Joel (all drafted after 2010) That's 60% of the top talent being &gt; 10 years and 80% being &gt; 11 years."
"yes thanks for pointing out the obvious.   lebron james dropped 21 points in the second half of game 6. there wouldnt have been a game after if it wasnt for lebron either. im not saying  ray allen wasnt a massive help, all im trying to point out is that people like op try to discount lebron by mentioning allen's shot as if lebron didnt have a great series."
This reminds me of 2011-12.  Writers/broadcasters voted for Tyson Chandler as the Defensive Player of the Year while the coaches only voted him as 3rd Team All-Defensive.  Today the writers/broadcasters decide both.  But LeBron James received the most All-Defensive votes from the coaches in 2011-12 (the only player with more than 50 points) and perhaps he was the real DPOY of that season.
"LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Khris Middleton, Pascal Siakam, maybe even Brandon Ingram."
Lebron James is good at basketball things
"Yes. Wade had multiple MVP caliber seasons, finishing behind only Lebron James. Wade also has a FMVP off a ridiculous performance."
"LeBron wasn't even looking to shoot for much of the series. At least with Steph you can't say he lost his aggression, and he did miss periods of that postseason with injury unlike James. Can point to the Draymond suspension as being a turning point in the series, as G5 ended not only with a loss but Bogut getting injured playing in his stead. Then going back to Cleveland where the Cavs had already beaten them once,  lost a 4th Q lead in G4, into a do or die G7 against one of the best game 7 players ever."
"All we really know about him as far as winning championships is that he didn’t beat Lebron James with his raptors squad. No offense... but that team wasn’t really anything special and would have been a massive upset to make let alone win a title. They’ve really become overrated in hindsight and again no offense because I’m not trying to shit on the Raps I’m just saying there are 5 teams as good as that best pre-Kawhi raptor team every single season.   I understand that when Nurse took over the style of play changed and a lot of raptor fans are happy with that. That being said, they had Kawhi Leonard and Casey never did. He made it to 6 games in the ECF against a great Lebron team that’s not bad.  Edit* and the raptors were inches away from elimination in the second round with Nurse, basketball is a lot of luck too."
"&gt; I'm sure someone as great as LeBron James  TBF this was on of the only knocks on Lebron about his work ethic until he reached Miami. How much work he put into what he liked and how he neglected what he wasn't so mad about.  But yeah, i agree with you overall. Dwight's workout with Hakeem is famous for centering mostly in the mental stuff. Apparently Ewing had done a great job at teaching him but Dwight just had trouble translating it into the court"
lebron james has 3 rings.
"WITHOUT USING REGULAR SEASON.  THEYVE MATCHED UP ENOUGH TIMES IN THE POST SEASON FOR YOU TO GO OFF THOSE NUMBERS.  REAL BASKETBALL IS PLAYED IN THE POST SEASON. THE REGULAR SEASON IS FOR PLAYERS WHO ARENT CHAMPIONS.   You're telling me LeBron goes hard all season like James Harden does? And also, history has shown all Dantoni's guards' numbers are INFLATED with no results. fuck off me niqqa try harder"
"It's kind of a lazy narrative..you mean in 30 years, only one player other than Michael (Kobe Bryant) wanted to put the work in?  I'm sure some players just can't master it. Some players have excellent footwork. Harden has great and creative footwork. Practically invented the negative dribble/step back. He just can't do what Michael can do.   Some guys have different strengths and weaknesses. I'm sure someone as great as LeBron James didn't just practice those moves he learned from Hakeem once and never put the work in. That doesn't sound right. I can't help to think he did he just wasn't as good at it.  Hakeem played soccer growing up, so did Kobe. It probably came more natural to them when it came to footwork."
"Let's imagine for a second that Kareem didn't have longevity on his side, and talk about Kareem's 13 best seasons, like people talk about with Jordan.  Over his best **13-year stretch**, Kareem averaged **27.8/13.7/4.3/3.3/1.1**\*, compared to MJ's 31.5/6.3/5.4/0.9/2.5, or LeBron's 27.7/7.7/7.3/0.8/1.6  Over his 6-year peak he averaged **30/16/5/4/1**\*  ^(\*steals and blocks were not recorded for the first four seasons of his career, so these numbers are possibly slightly higher in reality)  For reference, a comparable player like Giannis is the near-certain MVP this year and he is averaging 30/14/6/1/1. Kareem did this (better) for **6 years straight,** and had almost those stats for **13 years.**  He maintained a 59.2% true shooting average in his career, putting him 35th in all-time career true shooting; ahead of LeBron James (46th, 58.6%) and Michael Jordan (98th, 56.9%)  Need accolades? 6 NBA Championships. 6 MVP awards. 2 Finals MVP awards. 11 All-Defense selections. 15 All-NBA selections. 4x Block Champ. Lots more.  Please, keep your ~~cherry-picked~~ *stupid* narratives to yourself."
LeBron James has been known for his fast pass.
"Ya, LeBron James."
"NBA's YouTube channel used to post them. But nowadays I only find some on the team's YouTube channel.   Phantom cams are the slow Mo version of highlights. Most mixes use the normal topside view with a combination of these.   For Normal topside, you need to go to the games of the players via NBA League pass and watch em and record them.   Easier way is watching ESPN clips about the player. You'll find those angles you need when the hosts talk about the player. If the players are stars, then ESPN has playlists of all the things they talk about the player. Like ""LeBron James on ESPN"" or ""Stephen Curry on ESPN""."
Well games show highlights from topside angle when players have good highlights. There are phantom cams. And sports news have em a lot in the middle of conversations.  Let's say if you want an LBJ one. Just type ESPN Playlist on LeBron James.
"now the difference here is that this is pure talent while lebron james is extremely talented, he gets by mostly on size and contact  if michael jordan had lebron james body it would be a different story"
"You think that *LeBron James* is waiting in line at Disney World? He will be walking straight past the Make-A-Wish groups to the front of the line.  Also, having ridden space mountain at 6'4"", I don't know why any NBA player would want to put himself through that."
&gt;Lebron James had to learn how to be a champion in Miami.   This was just rhetoric that some writer used in LeBron's essay lol.  Do you also think people genuinely believe that LeBron saw his Miami years as akin to college?
"&gt; You're clearly very upset for some reason and I have no idea why. I don't like dealing with people like you who get irrational tunnel vision at the drop of a hat but I'll stick around if you're willing to be civil from now on. Won't hold my breath though.  Sorry, I have very little tolerance for people with no understanding of the topic.    &gt; I am. Are you? Take a deep breath  Clearly not, considering you are always stanning the guy;)   &gt; You're starting to understand. Nuance is a thing. You make excuses, yet so can I. It makes most sense, if you're talking about one player, to find comparisons where other variables are minimized. The best way to do this is in consecutive seasons, one with said player and one without. For Bosh this happened after lebron left miami, not in 2010.   WAIT WHAT? Are you fucking mental?   You think out of prime Bosh is a better comparison to use than.... in prime Bosh?   Holy fucking shit, this is one of the most awful takes I have read. The reason entirety of Bosh’s Miami seasons weren’t used.. bosh was out of his prime in this time frame.   And you know how you know you have absolutely no understanding of what’s going on?   “Other variables” are minimized? And you think simply playing on the same team is that? Fucking lol   &gt; For Kyrie that was when Lebron joined Cleveland.   So you are hellll bent on making sure Lebron James look good, that you are throwing away all sense of objectivity?    And so much for “other variables”   That Celtics team was far more comparable to the Lebron lead teams than the garbage Irving had before Lebron’s arrival.     &gt; For Pippen, that was when MJ left the first time. Compare Pippen's 92-93 stats to his 93-94 stats. Huge jumps in efficiency and scoring without MJ. You chose not to use those years. It's dishonest, no other word for it.  No buddy. It’s not dishonest. Try reading my comment again and in your own words “take a deep breathe” buddy.   I know this may seem hard to understand, but pippen’s season that year was a huge outlier and had one of his worst seasons of his career. Even if you include that season and couple that with the totality of his seasons with MJ.... pippen looks.... much... better. Slow enough for u?     &gt; That's what I'm trying to say. Your argument is weak because it's all biased, and very clearly so. To say Bosh and Kyrie joining completely new teams shows clearly how Lebron impacts their game is silly at best.  ?!!????!!??? Lol what? This doesn’t happen with MJ. This doesn’t happen with Kobe. This doesn’t happen with Nash.   That’s the point buddy, the fact that you think a player joining a new team means a completely different set of efficiency is one of the dumbest takes I have read   &gt; It's very dd again that you jump to explain the obvious while missing the point. Efficiency matters, and you can account for it with TS% or other stats. But to make a judgement call that x amount of T is worht more than X amount of scoring is, again, silly. That's just your opinion, man.  Huh? What are you talking about?   The issue isn’t x amount of t or whatever, it’s huge plummet in TS with a slight uptick in TOV.   Literally read. Lol   &gt; For example in 94 without MJ Scottie Pippen's scoring went up by 3.4 points per game while his TS% jumped by 0.34 while his TO% decrased by 0.5%. By your ""logic"" this shows that MJ clearly had a negative impact on Scottie's game. However, since nuance exists, I won't make such a black and white tatement.  So not only are you delusional, you haven’t read it?   Go ahead and read my comment again. That season is clearly mentioned on there.   That was Pippen’s outlier year. That was his least efficient year in his career. And that season that I gave you, accounted for that year... so realllly?   &gt; That was my point since the beginning. You can pick and choose stats to show that Lebron negatively impacts teammates, or you can pick and choose stats to show that he positively impacts teammates. Same for Jordan. You chose to get all upset over nothing.  Not really.   Jordan has far higher results of raising teammates’ Efficiency.   But genuinely, this clearly means you are not watching the game properly.   Lebron holds the ball the entirety of the game. He doesn’t have fixations like Mike to draw in hard doubles constantly and runs basically an isolation/pick and roll set every possession.   So when you are a role playing spot up shooter, Lebron can benefit you,   When you have more of a stronger role, he will not.   This is clear.   Hence why Irving immediately after leaving one of the best spacing team in the league, immediately gets a huge uptick.   Hence why Wade immediately dwindled in overall efficiency after Bron joined.   Hence why Bosh dropped off as well.   It’s asinine to think differently    &gt; Again, obvious. Why do you feel the need to reiterate the obvious multiple times to act as though you've proven something?  Because you don’t seem to grasp of it?   &gt; I really do have no understanding of what's going on in your head. You make no sense at all. I hope this clears things up for you a bit and you can keep a civil discussion, but if not then good bye and have a nice life.  Once again, tolerating delusion is hilarious.   “Let’s use Bosh’s seasons where he was out of his prime and compare him to his in prime form”   &gt; Your other comment is even more childish so I'll just briefly address it here. People say MJ is good because he was really fucking good. I don't understand why you point out the obvious in every comment as though you've proven some massive complicated point. Please relax, you've gone off the rails. Let's get this back on track.  Learn how to read comments please.   There’s a reason everyone is calling you out for bulllshit.   You, without any evidence, claimed players are changing history to alleviate their losses. This is hilariously stupid, imo."
"Lebron James had to learn how to be a champion in Miami.   Lol no, he needed talent around him. And he came back cause the Cavs won the lottery like every year when he was in Miami."
"&gt; On the wing, **LeBron James** (Los Angeles Lakers) largely won [the battle he had to fight mainly against Kawhi Leonard](https://www.lequipe.fr/Basket/Actualites/Nba-elisez-votre-cinq-majeur-de-la-saison/1135530) (Los Angeles Clippers).    So reporters are lying now?"
PG: Lebron James   SG: Michael Jordan   SF: Kevin Durant   PF: Kevin Garnett   C: Kareem
"&gt; easier to build around  So easy that AD just packed his bags and demanded to join LeBron in LA. Shit why didn't the Pelicans just think of that, just get yourself a LeBron fucking James, its so easy"
"Very good point. Definitely one of the best team leaders in NBA history. Plus, He performs exceptionally well under pressure which speaks volumes about the type of player he is. He’s top 10 all time no matter what in my opinion. I just hate ranking players on the basis of championships. For perspective on that, I also think Lebron James is the best basketball player of all time."
"PG: Magic Johnson, Steph Curry  SG: Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant  SF: LeBron James, Larry Bird  PF: Tim Duncan, Karl Malone  C: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell."
"His numbers were on one of the slowest paced teams ever (top 10 slowest All Time, in fact).  Thus, his numbers get skewed.  Once you adjust for pace, his last healthy numbers (08-09) are comparable to James Harden at the same age (age 24).  So that 22 ppg at 24 years old would look closer to 25 ppg on a faster paced team.  Kobe and prime Ron Artest called Brandon Roy the hardest player in the league for them to guard.  That's two elite defenders, one of them being a former DPOY.  His offensive arsenal was that deadly where he could hurt you from anywhere on the field.  He was ""complete"" like Kobe said.  And honestly, he's like a mix of Kobe and Lebron in that way - where he could penetrate the strongest defenses but juke you out and sidestep for a midrange.  If his shot isn't falling, he'll draw defenses and kick out like Lebron.  Not known for having a three point shot, he went ahead and developed one during college.  That showed how dedicated he was to improving his game.  Likewise, he was talented and smart enough to handle point guard duties.  Only two guys made their teams better by possessing a complete game like Roy did and those two are CP3 and Lebron James (though, I think Luka Doncic is on pace to do this as well).    In that sense, he's just one of those players that his playing style told more than his stats.  He'll make the right pass, be in the right position, fundamentally strong, incredibly clutch, direct teammates, and provide leadership.    So, if he stayed healthy, I wouldn't have been surprised if he ended up with a few seasons of 29-30ppg at his peak.  Lastly, his biggest thing he was known for but still doesn't get enough attention was just how clutch he was.  There was some stat during his first 70ish games where he hit the shot to tie or take the lead with 60 seconds or less 30+ times in those 70ish games.  That's just how clutch he was.  Furthermore, he was #2 in clutch FG% and #2 in needing to be assisted to hit the shot in clutch moments.  For the former category, #1 belonged to Lebron and for the latter, it belonged to Chris Paul.  So young Roy was almost as clutch as prime Lebron was (Lebron shot 46.6%, Roy shot 44.7%) but did not need as much help as Lebron did due to being a guard and therefore, capable of handling the ball.   We seriously missed out on a top tier talent.  Probably could've sat anywhere from Top 15-30."
"I think the 2013 Heat would have kept up with the 2016 Warriors 3 point shooting so I give them a better chance than the 2012 Heat. Ray Allen, Shane Battier, Mike Miller, James Jones, Lebron was 40 percent 3 point shooter too that season. They had a ton of 3 point shooting. Not to mention their perimeter defense and were athletic. Actually, I would give the 2013 Heat a really good chance."
"These people acting like they see LeBron James, Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard on the Daily basis. 😂"
Some guy made a post the other day stating that Scottie Pippen was better than Michael Jordan. In the same post he also compared LeBron James to Jesus Christ and MLK
Ok here’s my top starting 5 of all time:  PG:  Magic Johnson  SG:  Michael Jordan  SF:  Lebron James  PF:  Tim Duncan  C:  Wilt Chamberlain  I think this is a good top 5.
"Stephen Curry - Reggie Miller - LeBron James - Larry Bird - Hakeem Olajuwon  I know Reggie will get the most questions and ofc I don't think he's better than Jordan or Kobe, but I don't need a bunch of ball dominant guys. Reggie and Curry are both great off ball (Bird is too, but not on their level). So this team would have a ton of player movement with LeBron being able to create his own shot, create shots for Curry/Reggie/Bird with his amazing playmaking, plus Hakeem is a great defender who can also get his own shot with the ball."
"Kobe probably was the best in the league for a while but I don't really trust players opinions about that stuff cause just a few days ago Paul Pierce wouldn't even put LeBron in his top 5. A lot of it is narrative. Kobe WAS the narrative of the late 2000's.   From 2000-2016, MVP winners.  1) Iverson, Duncan, Duncan, Garnett, Nash, Nash, Nowitzki, Bryant, James, James, Rose James, Durant, Curry, Curry.  Looking at that list how was Kobe even considered the best for more then a few years.  From 2000-2016, MVP/Finals MVP winners and Championships. Not Necessarily at the same time.   1.) Kobe (5 chips)(1 MVP)(2 Finals MVP), Duncan (5 chips)(2 MVP)(3 Finals MVP), Garnett (1 chip)(1 MVP), Nowitzki (1 chip)(1 MVP)(1 Finals MVP), LeBron(3 chips)(4 MVP)(3 Finals MVP), Durant(2 Chips)(1 MVP)(2 Finals MVP), Curry(3 chips)(2 MVP).  Kobe won 3 of those chips riding shotgun to Shaq. Why isnt Tim Duncan who won just as much chips but more individual awards not considered better then Kobe?  It's narrative. And cause Tim was kinda boring but mostly due to Kobe playing in LA."
Skip Bayless said Johnny Manziel would be bigger in Cleveland than Lebron James
"LeBron James true shooting percentage in the 2018 NBA finals, not including game 1: 58.3% TS  Kevin Durant true shooting percentage in the 2018 NBA finals, not including game 3: 58.2% TS  But go ahead and accuse me some more"
Cause analysts Jack off to lebron James  Lmao this made me laugh way more than I should. Nonetheless it’s very true.
"Cause analysts Jack off to lebron James  Kobe was never a stat chaser, he didn’t give a fuck about fg pct. he would take shots during double teams. He would demoralize his opponents.  For example, I’ve heard lebron James fans say he’s a better 3 point shooter than Kobe because of percentage. Stats don’t say the whole story, I would bet my house on Kobe if they both took open shots"
"That's part of it, but there is some luck involved too. LeBron James didn't walk into the Cavaliers because they had a brilliant front office."
Did you just called LeBron Raymone James slow?
"All time heat in the format of 5 starters and a 6th man is a real contender too.  PG: '97 Tim Hardaway  SG: '09 Dwyane Wade  SF: '13 LeBron James  PF: '00 Mourning  C: '05 Shaq  6th Man: '16 Chris Bosh  IMO you can swap shaq with glen rice, move bron and zo down a position to allow for a more modern lineup, but this is still really good squad."
"I agree with James getting it that year. There were definitely people arguing for Melo at the time. LeBron got 78 first place votes, Melo got 40 first place votes. Nobody else got any first place votes. Their scoring was nearly a wash, with Melo doing it on better efficiency. Melo was the more prolific rebounder but LeBron the more prolific assist man, with nobody paying too close of attention to defense but an edge to LeBron there."
As big of a Melo hater that I am ....  I agree. He should have won ROTY that year.  But LeBron was LeBron. And voters get blinded by the hype.  I mean the dude was already King James before he entered the league lmao. The hype was surreal.
"It's the 21st highest single season VORP ever. Considering 12 of the ones above it are Michael Jordan or LeBron James, it's the 9th highest non-Jordan or LeBron season ever (keep in mind though that VORP only goes back to 1973-74), and that's with 7 missed games. It was a great season no doubt."
"He’s been back and forth on that one for a couple of years, now. But, there’s nuance to it. He has said LeBron “surpassed” MJ as the better overall basketball player. He’s also said that James didn’t have the killer instinct that Jordan, and to a lesser extent, Kobe had. He’s said he’d take MJ over LBJ on his team if he wanted to win a game. What has he said lately?"
"I'm just going with deductive reasoning here. I can't really picture LeBron James, with everything going on with his career at the time and even his behavior during the following season, doing this purely for altruistic reasons but that's neither here nor there.  &amp;#x200B;  It doesn't hurt my ego, its just sports dude. In sports I can totally make a judgement of someones behavior within the world of sports, so long as i'm not being super disrespectful its not a problem and just par for the course.  &amp;#x200B;  The end result was overall good, but I still think people are allowed to comment on the methods instead of just letting the ends justify the means so to speak. It'd be like if I convinced 10,000,000 people to pay me for jerking off on stage to balloon porn and donated the proceeds to charity. Yes I did a good thing but that wouldn't mean that I should be exempt from people also discussing how that was a weird thing to have happen."
Paul Pierce admits to spitting on LeBron James
"He did.  https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/06/11/lebron-james-hand-injury-photographic-investigation/  &gt;“Pretty much played the last three games with a broken hand, so that’s what it is,” James stated, admitting that he had let emotions get the better of him."
"I just consider multiple players better than LeBron James, are there another thousand players he's better than? Of course. But I rate him 10 or 11 All-Time. When people say I'm an old head because I don't see talent, I laugh because they think I watch 80s highlights all day. It doesn't really matter what your considering to me whether its rings, stats, MVPs, Longevity or anything else"

"&gt;None of them were wierded out by Dolan. They just chose Miami because Wade was already there.   Nah, there were reports of him being super awkward at that meeting. Like him reading from prepared notes, him handing out copies his fucking CD lol,   &gt;interview that when he hit the market with LeBron James and Chris Bosh back in 2010, and they were considering potential destinations for a league-shaking team-up, the team “just wasn’t prepared [or] ready to take on what we wanted to do. The city? Yeah, the city was ready. The market? The market was there. It’s New York. [But [from] an organization standpoint, we didn’t feel like they could handle it,"" and that it was “redundant to much of the New Jersey Nets’ far sharper, edgier presentation on James’s earning power.”     [link 1 ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2019/3/14/18265055/james-dolan-new-york-knicks-kyrie-durant)  [link 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20100703171749/http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=aw-wadelebronbulls072010)   Dolan's perception around the league is horrible.

On defense Brook is very solid 3 and d center while LeBron and MJ should be able to defend any two wing players any other team can throw at us while Danny greens a very good defender who can provide some useful help.

"""Not every issue is everyone's problem"" - LeBron James"
"In the same clip you linked, he talks about how it could impact the players and their families (whether this is a legitimate concern or not is up for debate, but this what he said)  &gt;Because when you say things or do things, if you are doing it and you know the people that can be affected by it and the families and individuals and everyone that can be affected by it, sometimes things can be changed as well.  In addition, he later clarified that he was talking about the ramifications of the actual action of tweeting, not the content of Morey's tweet.  &gt; ""I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I'm not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that,"" James said in a tweet.  &gt;""My team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it,"" James added in a second tweet.  Lastly, Lebron during a players meeting with Adam Silver discussed how he only speaks about issues hes knowledgable about, and how the Hong Kong situation put players in a precarious position because they felt they were being forced to address it when they didn't have enough information  &gt; ""I think when we talk about the political side, it was a very delicate situation, a very sensitive situation,"" James said. ""And for me personally, you guys know that when I speak about something, I speak about something I'm very knowledgeable about, something I'm very passionate about. I feel like with this particular situation, it was something not only I was not informed enough about ... I just felt like it was something that not only myself or my teammates or my organization had enough information to even talk about it at that point in time, and we still feel the same way.""  So, it's pretty clear that Bron was not disparaging Morey for supporting the Hong Kong protests, but was focusing on the position it put the players and the NBA in without their consent, which is absolutely fair"
"You think Lebron James was unaware of what was happening in HK? Not at all. He’s a lot of things but dumb isn’t one of them. He was actively trying to censor NBA employees from talking about it because it affects his bottom line (despite the fact that he is already nearly a billionaire). It’s not ignorance that drove his comments, it was greed."

"See it’s funny you say this when the exact same thing happened 2011. LeBron was the best player in the league only to get clobbered by Dirk and outplayed by Wade heavily. It’s the same literal situation, although due to KD joining Curry’s numbers declined since he saw less use. If you’re going by throne I can see where your coming from, no one has dethroned LeBron yet. On that I wholeheartedly agree. But I’m not discussing throne, I’m talking about the 2015-2016 season where Curry played better for all but 7 games then LeBron James."

It's not just Corby. The radio station is known for mixing humor with sports. It's the same station that asked this question: [LeBron James is not sure if the Lakers can stop Luka’s razzmatazz hop skiddily-doo.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dq7u79/mulford_lebron_james_is_not_sure_if_the_lakers/)

"&gt;James said. “We all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others, and you’re only thinking about yourself. I don’t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.”  That's not ""I'm ignorant on the subject matter so I don't feel comfortable speaking about it."" He literally said that Morey was the one who was uneducated on the subject.  I don't think players have an obligation to speak out on every atrocity in the world because that would be endless. But LeBron is actively DEFENDING the Chinese government by saying that Morey wasn't educated on something he was passionate about."
Hong Kong isn't in their daily lives. Witnessing/being subjected to racial profiling is. Most these players went to college for the sake of going pro not getting a degree. I think we can excuse them for not studying international politics. I know plenty of political science graduates from when I was in school who has never heard of the Sino-British joint declaration so expecting Steve Kerr or LeBron James to have heard of it is silly.  They can speak on issues that affect them all day long. I'd rather they not talk on things they don't really know about. I'm glad for people like Steve Kerr who admit they don't know enough to say anything about it. Too many people think you gotta have an opinion on everything.
Lebron James
I think the main thing OP is missing too in conparong hong kong/lebron and dolan/blm is that james dolan has lived in america his whole life where race relations has been a major topic for his entire life.  The hong kong/china topic is foreign to america and most americans actually are uneducated on the situation.  Being american and claiming to be uneducated on race relations in america is pretty disingenuous.
"Boogie, James, Davis, Howard, McGee   7 footer death lineup (and lebron)"
"The were a hard nosed defensive team,who shared the sugar on offense. They were one of the first teams to track hockey assists in the NBA. They weren'ta juggernaut,but their team chemistry was next level. The teams inconsistencies could be directly attributed to their young leader Lebron James. He was a poor shooter both perimeter and free throw. He didn't really have much of a post game either, so in the playoffs when the game slowed against elite teams,he became inconsistent. If they were trailing, or the game was difficult he was fun Lebron from the regular season. He bite his,nails pout,etc. He's still passive aggressive from time to time,but he grew up a lot in Miami."
I find it hilarious how LeBron signs everything off with James GANG but had the nerve to call Phil Jackson a racist just for using the word 'posse'
"&gt;Im not sure camera quality makes the game appear faster..do you have any evidence to backup this assertion?  It's an anecdotal thing. If you watch old game footage, a lot of the time it just appears slower. Maybe because it's just not clear. I don't know how else to explain it.   &gt;This has nothing to do with the speed of the athletes but more to do with the number of possessions per game. This can be influenced by the number of missed field goals (for example the 60s had the highest pace, but that is because they missed more shots hence more extra possessions).  I know. I didn't say athletes back then were just as fast.   &gt;Apologies for misquoting you. But if you say the average player is better now then what makes you think Bird would be dominant now when he is playing against a raised floor for a replacement level player? Wouldnt improved competition in terms of bigger/faster players impact his production?  He is playing against a better competition but part of that better competition is because nutrition, training, supplements, etc. are all more advanced now. Players are focused on shooting more 3's and post play is considered inefficient. Larry Bird didn't have those advantages. Larry would get to benefit from these things if we move him to today's era. Keep in mind he was still doing great with a fucked back. Today, his back would never get fucked.   Also, today's era is great for players like Larry Bird. He would benefit from the spacing today. And teams would love to have a big guy that can shoot and playmake like him.   &gt;I imagine you envision him being used as a stretch four. You also envision him being an above average 3 point shooter on decent volume. I wonder why you think a player who shot 37% on 1.9 attempts per game would all of a sudden shoot around the same % on say 7 attempts per game.  37% in an era where he didn't need to practice threes, and when the spacing was abysmal. He was an elite free throw shooter and mid-range shooter. If he's brought up in this era, his shooting would skyrocket. He certainly has the touch for it. He wouldn't merely be a stretch four either. Jokic is a top 7 player right now and Bird is more athletic, a better defender, comparable 3 point shooter (yea Jokic 3p% haven't been very good), and comparable passer. Bird can play a similar role even if he's not a great 3 point shooter altho he probably would be.   &gt;I have provided my video evidence so now you show me yours. Provide me a video of those guys dribbling where their hand placement on the ball is significantly different from Isaih's. This is actually majoring in the minor because the average dribbles per game per player is a lot lower now. Players attack more off the catch now than they do pounding the ball in iso situations so choosing ""more carrying"" as the hill to die on is particularly strange.   It's not a hill I'm dying on. In lot of highlights of players today, you'll see them do a lot of fancy shit which justifiably does make them look better than older era players if you ignore context. I'm just saying that Larry didn't have that freedom of ball handling that players do today which is one way his highlights might not look as impressive as Kawhi's.   The gather step rule is enough evidence. It didn't exist in Larry's time. James Harden's stepback is a travel in the 80's. So is Kawhi, Giannis, and LeBron barreling to the rim.   [Here is Kawhi traveling (by 80s rules) on a gamewinner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChT3ewZXTfM)  [Isaiah Thomas carry compilation. In the comments, you'll see a lot of people saying ""Oh but everyone does it"" further proving my point.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpRZUazIurw)    &gt;Players like Kevin Durant, Giannis or Lebron arent particularly known as great ball handlers so how come they are the best now if palming the ball is such an offensive advantage? Oh and Larry would be allowed to palm the ball as well in this scenario so it would be a level playing field lol  Kevin Durant is known to be an extremely good ball handler for his position lol. People constantly praise his guard-like crossovers.   Giannis is a great ball handler for his position. So is LeBron James.   The reason they're the best is because they're fucking good at everything. I didn't say dribbling is a huge offensive advantage. I said the freedom of dribbling makes players look like better ball-handlers and more impressive than they actually are. I've seen people say Larry Bird could barely do a between the legs crossover. It's not his fault the rules were strict. You yourself said Kawhi's highlights look more impressive than Larry Bird's.   Yes, it would be a level playing field but it's not a level playing field if we're comparing the highlights of two different eras."
Lebron James
"To expand upon 3, Rose wasn't fun to watch because of stats. He was aesthetically pleasing to watch with the way he contorts his body in mid air. He was also only 6'2 (shorter than Steph) but he'd still drive into the lane with no regard, and still somehow score. That's very David and Goliath like.  Rose was very likable too. He was humble, quiet, and not very showy off the court. [An example was at the All Star game where others were dancing and he was very stoic.](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/976011/d-rose-dance.gif) He played for his hometown and seems to be loyal to that city. This was contrasting to LeBron's The Decision, and [""not 1 not 2 not 3 not 4"" party](http://media.nj.com/nets_impact/photo/lebron-james-chris-bosh-dwyane-wade-introduced-in-miami-7821fbe30df9302c_large.jpg). Youngest MVP after [""Why can't I be the MVP of the league""](https://youtu.be/s3NVmn51zE0), sky's the limit for him. Ultimately, his downfall was [a tragedy that wasn't really his fault](http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3b3k0omsZ1qzhy1ao1_500.jpg), and even [his return was very touching too](https://youtu.be/XC_kZd5nSjw)"
"It seems there's a lot of miscommunication that goes in, there's a difference between ""they were trash, terrible teams"" and ""they were contenders **when you take into account the greatness of LeBron James and how he elevated the play of the players surrounding him**"""" and ""they were a great team, even if LeBron wasn't there"". I don't think anybody really makes the third statement, a lot make the first statement, but the second statement is where the truth of the matter lies."
"Ezeli fouled LeBron on a three point attempt, the next time down the floor the Cavs got the same matchup, Warriors did NOTHING to adjust, Festus this time gave him the open three, credit to James he drained it, then Kerr called timeout. It was a 6 point swing in a quarter that saw the two teams score a combined 31 points. That was the turning point imo. Could LeBron have taken advantage of Andrew Bogut in that same scenario to the tune of 6 points? Sure, he’s one of the greatest players of all-time...but, it would by no means been as easy, and I’d guarantee Bogut’s not leaping at a LeBron terminated dribble pumpfake from three, it would’ve been a standing contest.  No one seems to bring up Andre Iguodala playing through significant back spasms as well. You see Andre still playing above the rim in 2018 with the Dubs, easily throwing down lobs, but on that iconic LeBron chase down block, the man tried to lay it in. Earlier in that game during a timeout, you could see him struggling on the bench not able to sit."
"Hey back off man.  Do you know how much courage it takes to make an Instagram post?  He's truly leading the revolution.  All the racist cops are going to think ""LeBron James said racism is bad on Instagram, I had no idea.  I'm so sorry LeBron, I'll stop right now."""
"Americans have saved trillions of dollars in consumer spending in industries that use slave labor. Mass consumption and governing institutions are the primary drivers of these industries and their behavior since that's where the money's coming from. Not some individual rich guy. Lebron James saying ""CHINA BAD!"" isn't going to do shit."
"nowhere in any of this did I say that Jimmy wasn't a part of leading the T'Wolves to the playoffs.  You said ""let's talk about Jimmy Butler"" so I did, when he was there the T'Wolves made the playoffs.  Had he stayed healthy they would have, as you pointed out, been on pace for even more than the 47 wins they got.  You're the one trying to draw some kind of ridiculous false equivalence between Jimmy Butler and LeBron James.  TBH I normally would have dropped this like 10 comments ago but it's been fun trolling you with actual stats &amp; info while you sit there &amp; say ""in my opinion Kyrie is better"" without actually bringing anything to the table to support that."
"Influence is the biggest thing. The primary issue is the fact that too many people are either unaware, dismissive, or support the current status of law enforcement in the US. When looking at a candidate for any position you should be looking at their platform's relation to equality as a bare minimum indicator of whether or not they should get the position. If you have a history of discrimination, you shouldn't be getting votes. Except in reality, they do. Since many people support or think it's not a big deal. Having people that are respected among the crowd that falls into one of those groups helps a tremendous amount for shifting public opinion. Big difference between LeBron James and Tom Brady making a political statement since they reach different groups."

"What a pity this game!  LeBron James put up one of the greatest performances in NBA Finals history, and JR Smith ruined it all that way.  That's just cruel!"
"That was really for Lebron James,he had been holding on to it for too long and needed to just get it out"

"&gt;So?  Great rebuttal.    &gt;you don’t see Darryl Morey tweeting about BLM   Daryl Morey is tweeting, a lot.    And I know you're smart enough to understand the difference between Daryl Morey's impact &amp; Lebron James.  Especially when Hong Kong is a cultural hot spot for the NBA where he is idolized, while their people are being murdered on the street.  Did you want Jerry Krause endorsing governors running for their seat?  At least I hope you're smart enough to know the difference.   &gt;he’s never done anything bad off the court people/his haters are just holding on to this for as long as they can cause it’s all they got  Yes, while innocent people that bring in millions of dollars for him &amp; his friends are murdered on the street, for a cause that actually matters his haters, as you call them, are hanging this over his head like a competition on how many times he's messed up.  Narrow minded garbage logic."
"&gt;Well, LeBron James is black. So it should matter to him?  I never said it shouldn't matter to him.  If it's the only thing that matters to you, don't be surprised when others won't join your cause"
"&gt;LeBron doesn’t need to risk any of that to be put on the same level as Ali.  What has Lebron James risked that gets to put him on the level of Ali. Responding to OP's post by trying to create the false equivalent is ignorant and greatly downplays Ali's contributions as an activist. Expect more from your role models, be better."
"This is a false equivalent. Until Lebron James willingly risks his career to stand up for a cause he believes in, he'll never be on the same level of social activism as Muhammad Ali.  Ali stood against the Vietnam War and was barred from boxing during the peak of his career. Putting Lebron and Ali even in the same sentence in this sense is disrespect to Ali"

Skip: [Jordan would beat LeBron James 1v1 in 2015](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mjykt1qHBk)
"No mention of 2012-2013 Heat? They are top contender..    Lebron James  Dwayne Wade  Chris Bosh  Ray Allen  Rashard Lewis  Juwan Howard  Udonis Haslem  Mike Miller  Shane Battier     I mean, this team is DEEP. And has a ton of spacing and defense down the entire roster. Ideal team to build around Lebron too. As far as fit goes, I think this team beats all others."
"Coming this July, *Triple Team*. Starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson as LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as Anthony Davis, and Kevin Hart as JR Smith."

Lebron has not. Although younger people are pretty much guaranteed to say lebron, while older fans may still have feelings for players like Kareem or even Bill Russell as no.2 over lebron, but pretty much everyone is Jordan &gt; Lebron"
LeBron James
I don't know but you have something in your username about AD for finals MVP. Did you know Lebron James has 3x finals MVP awards?
"Yeah, and I think a supporting cast that helps a LeBron James-led team to a 66 win season is certainly “championship caliber”. As I said, it certainly had flaws, but that supporting cast was capable of playing up his strengths enough to win a title if we played out that season again somehow."
"Good management is always required unless you can land a LeBron James.  And even then, the Cavs still needed LeBron to go away for a few years and get Kyrie and Love to win a championship.  Good management isn't a strategy like tanking.  It's a prerequisite to being good.  But I agree it's not clean cut.  It depends on what stage your team is in.  You tank if you need to get younger.  You trade away what you can for picks or young talent.  Naturally your team will also suck, which regardless of whether you call this tanking or not, is the purpose of tanking.  If you are past this, you don't tank."
Ahhhh how times have changed.  [Here’s](https://np.reddit.com/r/sixers/comments/anxo8u/eb_for_roy_and_executive_of_the_year/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) a thread from the Sixers sub praising Elton Brand for not getting **LeBron James**
"i’m just listing heat teams cuz i’m obviously a fan lol 2011-Mike Bibby, Dwayne Wade, Jerry Stackhouse, Lebron James, Chris Bosh, Zydranus Illgaskus, Juwan Howard , mike miller. i just think this team is interesting because besides the big 3 these other guys we old af but were all really solid in their prime."
That Lebron James is some kind of political dynamo.
"Lebron James is the greatest NBA player to ever pull on a Miami Heat jersey, however Dwyane Wade is the greatest Miami Heat player in NBA history."
His last playoff run was 2 years ago. Lebron James was 2 years younger 2 years ago.
"&gt;I see the comparison you're trying to make, which is that Steph played on the team with multiple injuries and willed his team to what they got in that series. But not only do the stats not back up that comparison:   &gt;LeBron in 2015: 35-13-9, on 40-31-69 shooting splits, and two wins  &gt;Steph in 2019: 31-5-6, on 41-34-95 shooting splits, one win  The warriors won two games, not 1.   &gt;But just the eye test of this comparison doesn't hold up. LeBron looked like the best player in that series in 2015, whereas Kawhi Leonard looked like the best player in the NBA finals last year.  I honestly disagree. Curry definitely looked like the best player that series to me. Kawhi was great games 2-4 and good in game 5. He wasnt the best player on his team in games 1 and 6. He certainly had a lot more help than Curry.   &gt;That's why in 2015 Andre Igouldala got 7/11 votes for finals MVP in 2015, while LeBron got the other four votes. Steph Curry did not receive a single vote. Whereas again in last years NBA finals, Kawhi got 10/11 votes, Fred VanVleet got the remaining vote.  &gt;So to sum it up, that's 0/22 votes for Steph Curry in the NBA finals in 2015 and 2019. Steph has only ever received votes for finals MVP in 2018.  Well, the entire point is that people like me and OP disagree with the voters. So I don't really see how bringing up the voters decision is relevant lol.   As for 2015, isn't it pretty widely believed that the voters colluded and the curry voters gave their votes to Iggy so it wouldn't be split and go to LeBron?   Regardless, Iggy winning it in 2015 was just silly imo. The only reason Iggy was effective offensively was because the entire Cavs defense was worried about curry.   And yeah sure he defended LeBron James. But to be fair, as you say, LeBron averaged 36/13/9 lol"
LeBron james isn’t on PEDs. I mean give me a break just look at the guy. The NBA is the genetic elite of the world and this guy runs around with a worse hairline than George Jefferson at age 22 looking like the Hulk despite being surrounded by 7 foot + NBA players. If you think that guy is clean you are blind. It’s like watching Mark Maguire and Barry Bonds
Its Lebron James and Zion Williamson isnt it
LeBron James. His block on Iggy was arguably the most clutch defensive pkay of all time.
"Easily. I don't mean to downplay other bigs who could pass, but if you watch the tape, Jokic is not only the best passing big, but is such an elite passer that he is more comparable to Magic Johnson or Lebron James. His vision is incredible, and he has the accuracy to pull bullshit like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahcKuSsffAU). Some guards have inflated assist numbers because they handle they bring the ball up court and pass the ball to a superstar who makes a hard shot. There's a mountain of difference between some assists and others. Some assists are basically no value, they didn't ""create"" much at all. Others might as well just be 2 points."
"Bucks are a top 2 team in the league with an emerging all-time great so can't go wrong there.  Lakers are also a top 2 team. They have the 2nd best player ever in LeBron and a Top 7ish player Anthony Davis. Plus they're in LA, so they'll almost always have superstars.  There's the Dallas Mavericks who have Luka Doncic who is already one of the best players in his second year. They also have Kristaps Porzingis who is an exciting young player with potential.  Pelicans have Zion Williamson who was the 1st overall pick this year. Ever since he returned from injury, he's been absolutely dominating in only his first year.  Clippers have reigning finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and Paul George who is also great.  Nets have Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant (KD is out for the season tho). Next year they really have a chance to compete for the championship  The Rockets have James Harden, one of the most prolific scorers ever and is currently averaging 35ppg for the second straight season. Russell Westbrook is also an electrifying top 10 player who's been playing great this year.  Those are just the main teams I'd suggest. Anymore questions let me know."
He was kinda Lebrons personal reporter for a while even if was not directly connected to Lebron himself.  They whent to the same highschool.  https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2017/meet-the-reporter-whos-covered-lebron-james-since-he-was-a-high-school-player/
Kevin Durant is a two time champion same as lebron James is a 3x champion  If your gonna criticize one make sure You don’t forget lebrons “decisions”
"He was a young player that showed flashes of greatness in houston. Anyone of us knows itd be smart to trade for Lebron James , a GMs job is to find the diamonds in the rough"
"Lebron, Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokoumpo, James Harden"
"Yes, who can forget when he rescued the team that already had lebron James by trading every asset on their roster for a star with 1 year left on his deal who said he only wanted to play for the lakers"
Delonte West and LeBron James
How can you say Lebron was the number 1 offensive player of his time when his time includes James Harden. And no he is not better than MJ on defense. MJ was top 5 defensively during his era.
James harden Luka doncic Giannis antetokounmpo Steph curry  Lebron Dame dolla  Devine Booker Jayson Tatum  Paul George Kyrie
"Kareem is certainly ahead of Wilt and Bird.  Probably over James too.    I'd rank the players: MJ, Russell, Magic, Kareem, LeBron, Wilt, Kobe, Duncan, Robertson, Bird."
Lebron James and Kyrie Irving  Lebrons top 5 in every category all time and Kyrie is almost the same as Steph in the way they think as they play
"He's 8th in the first list, OP just wrote James instead of LeBron which is kinda confusing. For the second list,  LeBron usually plays more off-ball when Rondo and Lonzo were on the court with him  as well as BI. The lakers also got many of their points in transition so Lebron wasn't holding the ball for long."
"On number 8, why did u write just “James” wouldn’t adding Lebron be better."
"Yeah of course, there is *Athletes Are Brands Too: How Brand Marketing Can Save Today's Athlete* by Jeremy Darlow; *Kicks: The Great American Story of Sneakers* by Nicholas Smith. There have also been papers done on these topics, for example: Mocarski, Richard &amp; Billings, Andrew. (2013). *Manufacturing a Messiah: How Nike and LeBron James Co-Constructed the Legend of King James.* Communication &amp; Sport. 2. 3-23. 10.1177/2167479513481456. It's a fascinating topic to see how effectively the NBA leveraged advertising in order to create outsized cultural impact, which is why NBA players are far more famous relative to the popularity of the sport compared to others. An Indian colleague of mine once put it this way, when the NBA had less than 1/10th the global fans as football, Nike still made Jordan the face of it's brand instead of a footballer."
Delonte West/Lebron James/Kyrie Irving  Gotta include all three generations
Jordan couldn't win against Bird. If we're ignoring Jordan's failure to beat great teams then we might as well just accept that LeBron James is the greatest basketball player of all time.
"genuinely as i type this, i have on game 4 of the 2011 mavericks vs heat finals. it does the same stuff :/  like i’m a semi recent fan, i know the mavericks win the series but i don’t know which games the heat win. it takes away everything whenever i see “lebron james and dwayne wade power heat to 1-0 series lead”.   i wanna just live in the moment bro lol"
Delonte West/Lebron James
Lebron James and Nate Thurmond.
"Westbrook could beat the shit out of anyone in the NBA. Except James Johnson &amp; Lebron, and Kevin Love, and Dellevadova, and McKinnie, and Dylan Windler, and Collin Sexton, and Darius Garland, and Tristan Thompson, and Andre Drummond, and Cedi Osman"
"IMO it's less of a convenience argument than it is based on realistic outcomes vs potential losses.   LeBron James has a relatively decent chance to effect real change here in the States. It also very important to him, and he has a personal stake in the matter. He can relate to the plight of the Black American because he is one. I bet his Instagram is chock full of racist ass DMs (relative to most people).   It is incredibly romantic to imagine that LeBron James could use his platform to help people around the world but unfortunately that isn't how things work. I would love it more than anything if his words could produce a better life for people around the globe, but they just *can't*.  The reality of this whole situation is that it is incredibly simple to make China change it's ways. The world needs to stop buying their products. But we would all *suffer* for that. We wouldn't be able to afford as much, we would have less choice in damn near everything, and in general our live's would be worse.   Is that selfish of us? Hell yeah. But it's *our lives*, man. We don't stop because we value ourselves more than others.  LeBron James cannot relate to the people of Hong Kong, and neither can I. I won't speak for you because I don't know. I also can't relate to the lives of black people in America, but it is in my backyard. I am so, so, so aware of it that is crazy to relate it to the situation in Hong Kong.   *I just don't give very much of a shit when it really comes down to it.*  And that's how I think LeBron views it. Would LeBron like to help? Sure he would! We all would!  But LeBron James not being willing to sacrifice the quality of his life, and the lives of his family for generations to come, is something that I can totally understand. The odds of LeBron speaking out and it having real, tangible benefits for Hong Kong is next to nothing. But the odds those words come back to bite him in the ass as well as nothing being done? Astronomically high.  Like, it's risk vs. reward. LeBron James cares more about his family than he does his public image when it comes to China, and I don't blame him for that one bit."
"I didn’t say he should’ve been a candidate for DPOY (although, he was narratively one the beginning of that season), I just said I think he should’ve made an All NBA team. Blocks per game isn’t the reason either, it’s the fact that a SF was getting so many blocks on a team like the Warriors that pride themselves on team defense. They lacked a traditional rim protector, and often times, he was that ON TOP of guarding the LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard’s of the world. Fast forward to 2018, and it was also Durant, not Klay, who had the main assignment of guarding James Harden.   I’m not gonna challenge your opinion though, I’m not a fan of advanced stats for defense. It’s just what I thought watching the season."

"“Do you think your favorite team could win the title this year? I root for the Los Angeles Lakers, current #1 seed with 3-time champ Lebron James on the roster. I think we have a great chance!”"
LeBron James murdered JFK
Lebron James will forever be the most “looked down upon” champion of all time.
"Being Team Lebron is basically taking an L already, but being against Kyrie is a whole other level of stupid. Perkins pretends to a man who stands on his two feet, but he is just a pawn to ""King"" James. Kyrie Irving not only is exposing the Illuminati, but is also exposing the 3-6 Mafia and their little minions aka Perkins."
Spurs dynasty is the best dynasty ever.  Tim Duncan is the Goat.   Steve Kerr would he a Hall of Fame player in today's game.  LeBron James would be Christian Laettner if he played on the 92 dream team.  Only way to beat the dream team would be a team with the goat Tim Duncan on it. Steve Kerr or Robert Horry would also have to be on that team to come off the bench to hit a dagger 3.
"LeBron doesn't make his teammates better.  CP3 is not even a top 10 point guard all time.  Russel Westbrook is better than James Harden.  Bash these teams all the time because of the fanbases,  Utah Jazz: Forever pretenders, even in 97, 98. Stockton is an overrated point guard and Malone is soft and cannot bbq chicken Dennis Rodman.  Toronto Raptors: Just never mention them and change the topic always.  Portland: relentlessly propose ways to break up the team. Keep asking how long Dame will want to be the franchise guy."
"Perkins doesn't strike me as terribly intelligent but he is right.   If Kyrie Irving cared so much, he'd be self aware enough to know nobody is taking him seriously and have an actual respectable, intelligent player represent his cause.   I say this because 365 days prior to that call, he had   - believed that Earth is/could be flat  - compared sports commentators talking about him when he was hurt to the struggles of Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.....on MLK day.   He is Kanye level nuts and a narcissist. It isn't about civil rights and social awareness, it's about Kyrie.   That's why LeBron is the GOAT. Actively gives back to his community, several charities, bought a fucking school, is active in civil rights , and is a well-spoken articulate man. A true role model. I don't have children but if I ever do, I would feel so incredibly blessed if they came out anything like LeBron James. He doesn't have to cave to anyone. Also, I believe if he was in on that call and boycotted playing, I think the NBA 100% cancels it, and I think they'd have to. Nothing is worth turning your back on him.  He isn't a Colin Kaepernick, he's not a Kyrie Irving, he's not a middle of the road guy, he's the face of the entire league. He didn't have to make a statement or comments, his actions speak louder than Kyrie's words. He wasn't there, that's all you need to know. There'll be a season."
When fucking LeBron James and Kobe Bryant are going 1v1 no less
Kidd was an amazing passer lmao. He's second all time assist leader. Him VC and Jefferson were the original lob city. Dirk was the best player on that team but it was also a collective effort especially on defense. Kidd literally was the main defender of LeBron in that series after game 2. If LeBron plays average Dallas doesn't win or it at least goes 7 games. He contributed in a big way despite of what the stats say. Winning means more than stats. Chris Paul only made as far as James Harden took him. He was the number two guy. If you're gonna discredit Kidd for having Dirk than you gotta do the same with Paul and Harden. And they didn't even make it out the West. If you only count regular season I can see Paul beating out Kidd.
"PG- Allen iverson, kyrie Irving, kemba walker SG- Joe Johnson, Jamal Crawford SF- LeBron James, Tracy McGrady PF- Blake Griffin, LaMar Odom C- DeMarcus Cousins"
Bc that would be ignorant and bad for business -lebron james
1) Adam Silver bases any and all decisions around Lebron James 2) Lebron is a complete front runner who has zero regard for anyone around him that can't help him win 3) Steph Curry is one of the biggest frauds in league history  4) Lakers couldn't build a championship team without utilizing proven talent   All of which would get a ton of response and feedback

"You really think LeBron James needed Cleveland to become a global icon? Mayweather earned a billion over his career in a less popular sport that requires PPV for premier events. If that doesn’t give you an idea of what these guys could make in an actual fee market, idk what to tell you.   The NBA is oligarchy/monopoly, and they know that. Hence the hard cap, intended to control the power and influence of stars and give it back to the “owners”. Absent that, they’d literally be pawns bidding ungodly amounts for the worlds best players. See Neymar &amp; Kylian Mbappé, and how much they sold for over the European soccer market."
"All credit for this goes to u/poorchris  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's *own teammate* was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  Wade: 26 PPG 6.4 RPG 4.6 APG 1.5 SPG 1.1 BPG 50 FG%   Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  Boozer: 17.5 PPG 9 RPG 2.5 APG .3 BPG 51 FG%   Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  Bosh: 19 PPG 8 RPG 2 APG .6 BPG 50 FG%   Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season. Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  &gt;""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  &gt;""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  &gt;""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  &gt;""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  &gt;""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  &gt;""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""  Scottie Pippen  &gt;""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  &gt;""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  &gt;""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  &gt;""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  &gt;""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  &gt;""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  &gt;""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  &gt;""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  &gt;""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  &gt;""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  &gt;""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  &gt;""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  &gt;""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  &gt;""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  &gt;""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron James himself, when asked to weigh in on MVP race  &gt;""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."

"Money follows the player, not the other way around. In reality, very few people care more about franchises than they do Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe, Steph, etc."
LeBron James getting paid 40M a year to put a ball in a basket for 35 mins and 82 games a year is real CHAINS.  Sign me up for that.

"Because Derrick Rose led the Bulls to the 1st seed, season swept the Big 3 Miami Heat, and the 2 best players Joakim Noah and Carlos Boozer missed a lot of games due to injury, making Luol Deng his best teammate.

"Honestly an uncapped league would be the most fair. Would suck for people who are fans of teams that have poorer owners, but in no world should Kemba Walker and LeBron James make the same amount of money."
- Prime Steph Curry (2016)  - Giannis has a peak right now that’s looking really scary   - The Goat Michael Jordan  - 2013 Lebron James
And the flip side is demar derozen and lebron james make similar money. As that as a starting point there will never be parity.
"Still perpetuates the idea that racism is solved. Maybe not for yourself, but for a lot of people out there they really have this mindset of:  ""Man how can racism really be that big of a deal. I just saw Lebron James give Alex Caruso a chest bump"""
"How did he not know enough 2 months after the event? Does this sound like a guy that said anything significant? Then after this he jetted to Miami for 2 weeks to duck reporters.   &gt;INDEPENDENCE, Ohio - LeBron James declined to clarify today what more he needs to know about the Tamir Rice case to offer his opinion, saying he gave ""everything I had in Denver about the situation.  &gt;""That's as far as I'm going to go with it,"" James said, following the Cavaliers' morning shootaround in preparation for tonight's game against Orlando. ""I've already talked about it. I don't feel like right now that I'm going to comment right now."""
But dude one is also LeBron James. If he’s on your team whatever he asks for you do it. 8 straight trips to the finals gives him that leverage. Kyrie hasn’t proved he can do anything without LeBron. Why should anyone give him the same treatment?
L James please report to the commissioners office .no thats too obvious... LeBron J
"&gt;He does all that, and you’re saying that not a single person thought “hmm, maybe this guy is the best player in the world?”  That's not what I said at all. So let me re-phrase it loud and clearly:  Did you think, ""hmm, maybe Westbrook is the best player in the world?"" when he won the MVP?  Did you think, ""hmm, maybe James Harden is the best player in the world?""  when he was putting up crazy numbers?   I don't know how long you have been watching basketball, but the answer is exactly that. Not the hyperbolic ""You can't tell me not a single person thought..."". Yeap, sure there were people claiming LeBron was better, and maybe he was. The majority of people were putting Kobe as still the best player on this planet and the player to beat.   Just like you can now say ""hmmm... maybe Giannis is the best player in the world. carries a mediocre supporting cast to xyz wins and he's given the MVP in two straight seasons, something only a handful of players eve done"".   But you and I both fucking know that the best player title belongs to LeBron (or Curry without injuries) until proven otherwise.    If the best player you mean who's putting up best numbers during the regular season? then yes. Maybe WB and Harden and Giannis and all those guys were best players during those seasons. Or we can just admit the truth like it has always been, that the best player in the NBA has been LeBron James these last few years with the exception of Steph Curry. Same thing back then, except the cases were reversed for LeBron."
They aren’t used negatively but kds last post season run before gsw is nowhere near as elite as the average LeBron run or the last two Kawhi runs or last season james harden
LeBron James for Davis Bertans would put the Lakers over the top
Are we actually entertaining the idea that Bill Russell was more athletic than LeBron James?
"but in all seriousness, if you are someone like Quinn Cook and you see Lebron James sneaking out for some tacos on a Tuesday...are you really going to report your team's best player?"
"Experts and analysts do not make projections based off the play of an individual player's play.  They do so off of team execution and they do so in accordance to how the teams were recently playing. The Cavs dominated the previous rounds prior to matching up against Orlando and Boston while those respective teams struggled much moreso to advance.   It is obvious LBJ elevated his team to great heights, but the expectation is that his team would execute because they got to 66 and 61 wins for a reason, and that reason is not solely Lebron James. His situation wasn't the most abominable thing in the world, it just wasn't the greatest either"
"The fact some people are STILL defending LeBron James over this situation is fucking pathetic.   Yes I can respect what LeBron has down for his community like building schools, etc.   But he fucking cowered away when it was the time to speak up because it was inconvenient for him.   You think police brutality is bad? Look at the fucking kids being beat senseless in the streets. Also AT LEAST in the US you can charge the police for misuse of force.   In Hong Kong, these police removed their ID and **ZERO** police have been charged with how they have treated the protestors.   I am part of the Black community and I've been invested in this issue since I have many friends from China and Hong Kong. You would be surprised to know how many Chinese friends are actually against their OWN government but are afraid to speak out against them.   Educate yourself before spewing dumb shit like ""LeBron and NBA player lives were in danger while they were in China"". It's not a fucking movie. China is not just going to kidnap LeBron fucking James and the Lakers lol. People using this to defend the cowardly comments made are just showing evidence they don't really know wtf they are talking about.   You can be aware of the racism and police brutality in the US, but to turn a blind eye to an even severe form of racism and police brutality happening in Hong Kong is shameless."

"&gt;I guess it is  It's not, because who reports the most robberies to police? It's not Bill Gates, right? It's not LeBron James. It's poor people, and poor blacks, in urban neighborhoods who are preyed upon that have to call police.  And to argue that comes from a place of privilege really misses the point."
Sources say LeBron James demands movies he has started (Trainwreck) to be repeat
lmao lebron james  shaquille o neal
"&gt; how progressive the nba has been in player empowerment.  lol so throwing the players a couple bones means the players shouldn't think in their best interest? Christ dude.  &gt;NBA players don't know how to run a multi billion dollar league  Yeah there's no way they could learn how to do that or pay someone else to manage it.  There's no way LeBron could build a media empire, he's too busy playing basketball.   Everybody knows old white guys like Donald Sterling and James Dolan are the only ones that can own sports teams."
"The last time any team won more than 3 in a row was the Bill Russell Celtics in the 60s lol, so winning 5 in a row would be huge  LeBron would still probably be going down as an all time great (because he is), but that comeback definitely helped cement his legacy, so I'm sure he'd have been making even more moves to secure another ring If he hadn't (also, assuming that the Cavs still made 4 finals in a row, losing 4 in a row would maybe hurt him as well). Though I don't know how much it'd hurt his legacy, losing to the super, 5-peat warriors.   Steph would be going down as a top 10 player, especially considering the fact in 5 championships he'd presumably have at least one fMVP (in assuming that 2019 would still go the same and KD would be Injured, in that case Steph wins the 2019 one. It's likely he'd won in 2016 as well). 2 time mvp, at least most likely 2 fMVPs, 5 rings... That'd be bringing him closer to Magic/Larry territory.   Klays legacy would just be more of the same. The second or 3rd option on an all time great team. The James Worthy, Robert Parish kind of role. Which, you know, is what he already is, but being a 2nd/3rd option on 5 championships in a row would bump him up  KD would become one of the most hated figures in sports history lmao. Definitely the most hated figure in NBA history. If you think it's bad now, imagine how it'd be if he joined a back to back championship then won 3 more with them. He may still be able to recover his imagine now, but in this timeline that'd be a lot harder. His legacy would be secure, though (but at what cost?)  Other notes:  The Cavs supporting cast from that time probably wouldn't be as well regarded. Kyrie wouldn't be considered on the same level he is now, for example. I wonder how people would be viewing the Kevin Love trade in this timeline.  The raptors image as playoff chokers would live on. But at least we'd have choked to the greatest team of all time in the finals! Kawhi's absolutely legacy would not be as set in stone, the DeMar/Kawhi trade would probably be seen as not quite living up to its potential (but he'd still have brought us to a finals). I'm wondering if he'd resign here and try to run it back if that were the case, especially with KD presumably still fucking off to Brooklyn after 2019. Unlikely though. Raptors Dan's wouldn't become quite as obnoxious as we have"

"Each player listed was drafted first in their respective year. The way the draft works the worst team is supposed to get a better chance at the best players so often you will have the best players on bad teams. Kyrie's situation is different from the other two in his team did a decent job giving him a playoff worthy team by being located in the same state that Lebron James was born in and by getting lucky with the draft in being able to draft Wiggums, and then trade him. The Pelicans tried to build around AD, but injury luck and some pieces just not working out screwed them. In KAT's case, well Minnesota's new front office cannot be worse than their last, so hopefully he will see the playoffs soon."
I thought Kyrie wanted to leave the Cavs right after the 2016 Finals.  Edit: Apparently that was the case if this article is to be believed   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2784792-kyrie-irving-reportedly-never-wanted-lebron-james-back-in-cleveland
"&gt;For fuck's sake, Lebron James literally developed anxiety and stress to the point of having panic attacks and you have to think some of that was due to the pressure of playing with Kyrie  That's what he gets for giving Kevin Love depression"
"I thought it was the front office under the new GM Koby Altman that wanted to trade Kyrie. There was a report saying they promised to LeBron that Kyrie wouldn’t get traded only for the trade to happen like 30 min later.  Here is the quote   &gt;According to the Athletic, when then-Cavs coach Tyronn Lue learned that the Irving trade was about to happen, he drove to meet James and put the latter on the phone with Cleveland General Manager Koby Altman. James was described as “adamant” that Irving should not be dealt away, and Altman reportedly assured the four-time MVP that the trade would not occur.  &gt;A few minutes later, it did, James discovered to his noticeable dismay. At an autograph-signing event in California, James “dropped the pen and slumped in his chair,” per Vardon.

"Jordan has twice the titles and Finals MVPs of Lebron, along with the fact he never needed a game 7 and holds an overall 24-11 Finals W-L record.  Jordan had a gold medal around his neck and a NCAA title with the game winning jumper on his resume before he played an NBA minute. He gave up 2 years in his prime and still threepeated as an old man. Lebron is hanging on in his 17th season to try and get a 4th title. Lebron has gotten swept twice in the Finals, couldn't even get ONE game. Even Jason Kidd and Iverson took a game in the Finals when they were completely overmatched. Jordan also won a gold medal with professionals, where he was the alpha of a hall of fame roster. Lebronze, well, we know how he did in his first Olympics, like his first Finals.   Jordan didn't lose 3 in a row from Nov 1990 through his 2nd Bulls retirement (6/13/98), Lebron lost 3 in a row in the FINALS six different times.

"Then he points out that the Heat were shit when James left, but forgets to mention that Bosh didn't play half the season.  How is 2012-2017 the greatest 5.5 year run in basketball? LeBron got 2 MVPs and 3 Rings. Jordan also has a 5 year stretch with 2 MVPs, 3 Rings.

"You are assuming that despite winning the 2013 title, nothing would've changed in the Heat OR the Spurs in this scenario which is a BIG assumption. The Spurs never repeated, never. Why should i believe that they would've done it in 2014 had they won in 2013? They were unable to do so in the past with better teams and with a better version of Tim Duncan.  A reasonable question would be what would change in Duncan's legacy going 5-0 with 4 Finals MVPs and i would say not much. The guys that people generally have ahead of him are considered to be better players with better peaks and the amount of titles they won aren't that significant.  Like, you can't make an argument that would make me believe that Tim was better than Magic Johnson, LeBron James or Wilt Chamberlain. I have him firmly at 6th and i would say i'm in the minority for doing so, but even in his prime he wasnt LeBron or Magic and winning in 2013 past his prime wouldn't change that."
"Are they fucking crazy? Trump probably will be responsible for a 100 deaths after that sick Munich like rally in Arizona. Maybe not the brain washed kids but their parents and grandparents.  I hope you noticed that Trump was far away from everyone.   No NBA. My favorite sport and a joy in my life for 45 years, since I watched Frazier as a 9 year old.  Lebron would have led the Lakers to the title. I’m sad for him. The best player of the three point generation.   We cannot let these guys and the fans endanger themselves so a small group of white guys, Trump supporters most, get even richer.  If you think players are overpaid, you are wrong. They are the best at their jobs in the world.  James Dolan is pig rich. And a pig. I’m not sure I can continue to be a Knicks fan as long as he is the owner.  Same goes for the rancid Wilpon family, who own my beloved Mets.  Politics have invaded sports. There is no refuge from it.  America is in real trouble folks."
this feels like that one reddit post about every team’s case to snag lebron james in free agency in 2018 and OP said “lebron james will not join the memphis grizzlies”
"Lebron is a rare case. He was good when he entered the NBA, then got freakishly athletic with a somewhat decent jumper, gets older develops a jumper and post game with slight decline in athleticism. If we could take his BBIQ and Jumper and put it on Heatles James I think he wouldve dominated championship like he claimed he would do. I dont recall too many player getting better as they got older."

Because that statement cost the NBA millions of dollars in TV revenue and sponsorships from China, yet you seem to imply that Silver did something else that kowtowed to China."
I have seen what him and people like LeBron James did. I don't need his statement.   Is this the first time you see person of influence makes statement while doing something opposite?
"Greater roster continuity produces better team chemistry and synergy, enables the team to think longer term, making moves such as trading a very good George Hill for Kawhi, instead of ""hey, let's grab Shaq so LeBron will stay"" or ""let's give James Jones 3 years so LeBron will stay"", moves that, you know, make the team better? And dude, looking at ur other comments, you really need to chill. We talking basketball during workday here, why so pissed?"
"I've read Simmons since the early 2000s, big supporter.  But this is... shady? I get wanting credit for the thing, but he went on to trash LeBron for years after, while he pitched it to the ESPN.  Not sure how I feel about that. Bill mentioned LeBron won't come on his show due to his decision narrative once  Here is the NY Post article   https://nypost.com/2020/06/24/bill-simmons-mailbag-inspired-lebron-james-decision-that-david-stern-never-wanted/  Not mentioned in the OP - Simmons pitched the idea to ESPN and to Rose, LeBron's agent at the time."
So random Redditors are getting off 1000's of shots in the first 100 games against LeBron James?
"LeBron James: ""Ok, fine. No problem"""
Lol exactly my point. You can’t take LeBron freaking James out of top 5 even if he missed a whole season. Some say he’s the best player ever and you would take him off?
Lmao did prime Dwight ever play with Lebron James and another all star? You put Kemba or Lowry where Kyrie was and they still win rings.
"I believe lebron james will be out there, most likely anthony davis as well"
"My tin-foil hat theory is [the Laker's have been holding team practices](https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2020/06/19/lebron-james-and-lakers-are-apparently-having-secret-workouts-together/) to expose players to the virus before the playoffs  With his vulnerable son in mind, Avery Bradley was likely offended by the team's unethical practices *(and the bubble environment in general)* and decided to walk"
"Steph Curry, LeBron James, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Chris Paul, Jimmy Butler, John Wall"
"Yeah man, Lebron James is forcing a these other players to play, its not like they actually want to play too right? Nah its Lebron's fault as always."
"""All I'm saying is you can always make another kid. You only get so many chances at a ring.""   -LeBron James. Probably."
"Two agencies -- drain65's Sport Athletes and Klutch Sports -- have merged, per release.  Combined clients include Lebron James, Anthony Davis and John Wall.  “Merging our efforts in basketball will create exciting new possibilities as well as broader expertise,"" Sport Athletes' President drain65 said."
"From what I’ve gathered, this sub has a lot of subscribers who are very bad at basketball but there’s also a sliding scale of good basketball players here too (ranging from low college on up through non-NBA professionals... and even NBA players but we won’t count them for the sake of discussion).  A lot of us have played against NBA players before, either while they were in the league or prior. We know it sucks to play against a guy with more talent in his finger than you could ever hope to achieve. But they’re still human and fallible under the right circumstances. Even LeBron gets scored on when playing non-NBA pickup sometimes.   In this case, we’re literally talking about leaving him out there until someone scored. You’re not going to get the same LBJ effort three days in, for example. If we’re talking a non-stop revolving door, James is either going to have a lapse, a real ball player here may luck into some junk, or a low level 6-foot-4 mad lad is going to quick trigger a lucky hook shot 3-point that catches him off guard."
Olympic bronze medalist Lebron James?
LeBron James for Steve Kerr
"LeBron James is blocking the absolute shit out of any shot, from anywhere, that us chumps would heave. You are completely delusional about the talent gap between regular people and pro athletes... and then pile on the difference between LeBron and average pros.  Assuming James is remotely motivated no one is getting a shot off on him."
"AVERY BRADLEY THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE MAKER IN THE 2020 PLAYOFFS!?!?! BUT FIRST, SKIP BAYLESS TELLS US WHY LEBRON JAMES IS #4 ON HIS LIST OF GREATEST NBA FORWARDS."
"LeBron James: ""I'm going to the Warriors"""
"I'm going to make a small list of points for your brain to understand   1. Curry already proved in 3 years of college that he is a superstar and an all time great shooter despite whoever happens to be playing around him.  The fact that you say it has been ""proven"" that currys gravity is nothing without a great team tells me all I need to know about the who I'm waiting my time responding to.  No player ever does it alone except for maybe Lebron.  2.  Durant did not help curry, he helped the warriors.  Curry however really helped durant perform in the playoffs, it's right there in the statistics you can read them if you want or you can keep being annoying and uninformed.    3.  Saying that every player has gravity is like me saying J.R. smith is good at basketball... well yeah he was a professional but when you compare him to lebron james he starts to look like a child playing against adults.  This point you made is so infantile that I want the time back in my life that it took to respond to it.  4.  No shit the brilliance of one player is not enough to create a juggernaut.  Hell KD couldnt even get it done with westbrook, Harden, and Ibaka all on the same team. That's what made lebrons 2018 run so special, but then he got beat in 4 straight by an actual juggernaut... what was your point there?  Congratulations you refuted a point that nobody ever made.  5.  You know the nba is a business right?  You know that they still have to sell tickets and merchandise and attract viewers? So why the hell would curry say ""it's ok folks this is a lost season just tune in next year"".  They replaced kevin durant with deangelo fucking russell, and replaced klay thompson with... nobody, how about Iguodala???  The fact that you bought into this is laughable.  I bet you also bought it when Tristan Thompson said the East still runs through the Cavs.  They were always going to try to make the most of a lost season by getting as high of a draft pick as possible.  Or did you also believe them when they said deangelo russell was going to be a part of their future despite being a god awful fit.  I bet you also believe Wiggins is a part of their future aswell.  I you have a brain, you should probably start using it."
"He has five of the top seven playoff runs for points per 100 possessions among all centers, including the top two. Among all players only Michael Jordan (6), LeBron James (1) and Kevin Durant (1) have had better playoff runs.  For the regular season it’s eight of the top eleven including the top two."
Caruso hasn’t really shown he can carry an offense by his lonesome. But he’s such a great fit with someone who can (LeBron James). Literal flex tape covering the gaps the Lakers have.
"Think about it this way  The stats show  That the lakers are better offensively,defensively and that they are a better rebounding team While also being the more expierienced team the team with the better duo and the team with Lebron James who will be possessed in these playoffs to win for  Kobe  Lebron has led teams way worse then this to the finals"
PG13 + Aldridge &gt; Oladipo and Sabonis imo. With Aldridge and PG13 they could’ve (not saying they would have) lured another star to play with them. Perhaps Jrue Holiday or Gordon Hayward in 2017 or Lebron James in 2016. Then they trade for Kyrie Irving and sign CJ mccollum in 2016 and hey they might have somethin.

"This might be the dumbest post on this sub. You know in those prisons 80% of the people get it right? To make such a dumb post to imply that non players will never interact with players is moronic, but to then say it won’t spread takes it to a new level.   I hope to god you aren’t older than 10.  Honestly this is so fucken stupid it amazes me people like you without an ounce of critical thinking exist. Like how out there do you have to be to think Lebron James and all the other players will never ever be face to face with a non player for months.   God damn. I feel like your mom would be ashamed if she saw this post."
The Raptors probably haven’t even tried to trade for Lebron James so far lmao
This is all a sham.  Lebron James cares more about a sham tourney than BLM.  Everyone shut up and watch him dribble.
&gt;Why do people give LeBron James a pass for stacking the deck in his favor but not Kevin Durant? https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/g6ugxa/why_do_people_give_lebron_james_a_pass_for/  Why don't you tell us OP?
"PG13's not lebron james, but I feel he's a \*little\* more  than a ""Meh"". He's a pretty good player and could be a starter on a championship team."
"That being said, if you're dealt a LeBron James you should absolutely go for broke, if you're dealt a Paul George though? Meh."
Lebron James wanted to play in Indiana?
"The Celebrity to President phenomenon is going to happen again. Maybe not in the traditional celebrity sense. There were several top Generals who went from being major figures in the US Army to being President. (Grant, Eisenhower, Taylor.)     The other closest “celebrity” to President transition besides our current one is Woodrow Wilson. He went from being head of Princeton to a single term as governor of New Jersey to President. But again that’s a starting point from being the head of an Ivy League college. LeBron James is not starting from that."
"No you guys aren’t “okay,” Indiana has missed the playoffs once in the last 10 years. Your best player has played about 50 games in the last two years and have been the 5th seed the past two years. If I were a Pacers fan I would be proud of my franchise. You have had and picked up great prospects that formed into great players: Myles Turner, Brogdon, Dipo, Sabonis, Bogdanovic. I think Bogdanovic was a huge loss but I’m sure you guys will recover and sign someone with Dipo.   Also during the Paul George years you guys were great, but you had Lebron James in your conference. Those teams from 2011-2014 were great teams. Your starting 5’s were some of the most complete and best of the decade. David West was your guy’s X-Factor that made them the strong defensive team that they played out to be. Paul George is a baby and has always made excuses for as long as he was on the team. Remember when he complained he didn’t get the ball on the last possession in the playoffs? Then the next game he got it and choked per usual? I think you guys are better off without him"
"Kinda can defend it though. Mavs defensive strategy was exactly what the Jordan Rules prevented any team from doing in the 90s.   They played man defense but zoned on any James drive, constricting the paint and forcing either a bad shot or a pass to a bad shooter. It was a great coaching decision that was not met with a strategic response by a rookie coach.   Just look at the next year in 2012 and how they responded as an organization with how they were dismantled in the Finals: they added shooters and pioneered the era of non-center small ball.   I honestly can’t say LeBron “should have played better.” He was forced into terrible positions with no one to kick out to other than Chalmers who wasn’t even a starter for the Heat after the Big 3 broke up.  People criticize Lebron for not wanting Spoelstra as their coach in Miami when he first got there but he wasn’t wrong - dude was a rookie and it showed that first year."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/michael-jordan-faced-better-competition-than-lebron-james/amp/.
"Oh the lack of defense in today's game is very real.    The NBA has altered the rules to make it nearly impossible to play defense.  You basically need to be a Marcus Smart style bulldog that lives for defense to be able to guard a talented player one-on-one.  And there just aren't many of those in the league.  On top of that, the 3-point shot has become way too popular, which only exacerbates the issue.  It spreads the floor making it even harder to defend in the NBA.    The defensive rule changes were intentional to pull the game out of the overly physical defensive rut it was in, but it probably went a little too far.  Especially with the 3-point era compounding things.  One other factor - it's just become acceptable for stars to not try on defense anymore.  Basically another version of ""load management"".  If Lebron James stood around on defense like he does in the regular season these days in past eras, his own teammates would be turning on him.  So literally you have too many players who really don't give effort on the defensive end, and that makes defense even harder on those that try."
Lebron James
He's a forward on a team with Lebron James and Anthony Davis. Not much more needs to be said that that. There just isn't the space for the type of player he is and it takes time for a player to change their game to the degree that he'd need to to have success in this roster.
"""Fuck them kids""  \- LeBron James, probably."
"Oh god, not this tired narrative  again lol.  The 2011 Cavs are not the 2010 Cavs minus LeBron.

"Just to be clear, Lebron's team filed a trademark for ""Taco Tuesday"" knowing that it would be rejected for being too common of a phrase. That way, when they start their podcast (or start selling merchandise or whatever they are planning to do with it) they already have a government ruling stating they cannot be sued by anyone else for using the term.   [This article](https://www.sportscasting.com/the-real-reason-lebron-james-tried-to-trademark-taco-tuesday/) explains it a bit more if anyone is interested."
You mean LeBron “China” James?
Highly doubt it was Kevin Love.  There was always chatter about him wanting to leave MN to head back to the west coast .  No way he'd have wanted to go to Indianapolis.  It took lebron james for him to want to stay in the midwest
"The fact that such a huge percentage of black kids grow up fatherless is the number one reason why there's worse educational outcomes, higher poverty, and higher rates of crime among black communities. The same can be said of white kids, it's just a lot less likely to happen overall.   The best thing LeBron James does every day has nothing to do with basketball or politics or poor kids in Akron...it's being a devoted and dedicated father. Not just for his kids' sake, but as an example for others.   So, no, it's not a special right. It's a right held by every child...a right that is trampled far too often by self-centered, irresponsible, delinquent dads."

"All credit for this goes to u/poorchris  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's *own teammate* was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  Wade: 26 PPG 6.4 RPG 4.6 APG 1.5 SPG 1.1 BPG 50 FG%   Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  Boozer: 17.5 PPG 9 RPG 2.5 APG .3 BPG 51 FG%   Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  Bosh: 19 PPG 8 RPG 2 APG .6 BPG 50 FG%   Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season. Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  &gt;""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  &gt;""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  &gt;""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  &gt;""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  &gt;""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  &gt;""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""  Scottie Pippen  &gt;""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  &gt;""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  &gt;""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  &gt;""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  &gt;""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  &gt;""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  &gt;""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  &gt;""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  &gt;""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  &gt;""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  &gt;""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  &gt;""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  &gt;""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  &gt;""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  &gt;""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron James himself, when asked to weigh in on MVP race  &gt;""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
"Except he didn't lead the league in assists in14/15, it was 17/18.  Fun facts: Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Tiny Archibald, James Harden and Russell Westbrook are the only players to have achieved both at least once.   Robertson and Archibald are the only player to lead the league in both PPG and APG in the same season.  If LeBron maintains his league-leading assist numbers this year he'll become the 6th."
"Lol bro, don't out yourself as someone who didn't watch the series.  LeBron averaged 28ppg on 68% TS (!!!!)  Wade put up like 14ppg on 50% TS  And Bosh had like 13ppg and 6 rpg   James also had by far the best defensive rating of anyone on the Heat for the series, and was the only starter with a positive net rating."
Lebron James would like to have a word
Idk why he’s getting a lot of flak on that zoom call. One team has a prime LeBron James and the other does not.
Lebron James will take the horse!
"Fair point with Simmons but I feel the similarity between Simmons and Lebron is strictly the versatility. The way they play the game is not as similar as people suggest. Giannis and Lebron James are completely different players. Honestly, if Lebron didn't exist, I wouldn't be surprised if people were arguing that Giannis is a generational player."
"Easily, he's got very rare genetics, his combo of wingspan, body size &amp; hand size are almost unheard of.    He helped revive a fallen franchise, made the Big 3 playable again.  By his 2nd year (technically his rookie year) he was taking James to 7 games in the Finala, a series everyone thought was over when TP became injured.    By 2014 he was able to become the only SF to outbest LBJ &amp; actually beat him to to toe, before this KD, PG, Melo, etc. Always came up short, Kawhi was the first.  He held him scoreless entire quarters at a time, neutered Lebron &amp; it wound up the largest point differential in NBA history,  4-1.    2x DPOY, 2x Finals MVP, multiple 60 win seasons, the only thing that's held him back are injuries &amp; even then he played the final 10 games of the playoffs on practically 1 leg whilst leading TOR in rebounding &amp; tying James &amp; MJ for the most 30pt games in playoff history."
LeBron James suffered a groin injury last year that sidelined him for a good month and a half. This injury occcured over a move he repeated thousands of times. (https://youtu.be/xhfrR3U9NTE)  This injury is cleary a symptom of father time.
"&gt; A 35 year old LeBron James who is declining. It's not so obvious because he has made several adjustments to his game, but the decline is real and father time is and will remain undefeated.  A 35 year old LeBron James who is likely to place second in MVP voting."
"A 35 year old LeBron James who is declining. It's not so obvious because he has made several adjustments to his game, but the decline is real and father time is and will remain undefeated.   You shouldn't put all your hope on an aging superstar."
Superstar player that is extremely Elite at something or all things. Need at least 3 seasons at high level.   LeBron-everything. KD-Scoring.  Curry-Shooting.  Kawhi-Defense. James Harden--Unstoppable scorer. Giannis--Freaky.
"Yes, it’s extremely logical to pick the team without LeBron James..."
"No, there's a bunch of players like Kawhi. Paul George, Jimmy Butler are all similar to Kawhi although Kawhi is better. You don't have anybody like Lebron James."
"Skip Bayless tomorrow:  ""LeBron James is a bully! Always has been, always will be.  Instead of doing things to help schoolchildren, he's the leader of the movement to bully as many kids as possible!"""
"Being an elite athlete does not mean you’re of the same caliber as Lebron freaking James, even at 35.  I’m not even a huge Lebron fan but this is just absolutely nonsense to even suggest.  Like you either don’t really watch basketball or have a Skip level hatred to think that they could be equal."
What that Lebron has lost a step? It’s pretty clear to me. And I’m not the only one that thinks so.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/3/18/18271424/lebron-james-los-angeles-lakers-potential-decline
"James Harden has gotten benched in an 4th quarter of an elimination game in the playoffs; only for his team to have an epic comeback and win the game. That'd never happen to the likes of MJ, Kobe, LeBron or any tier 1 superstar.  Harden is absolutely not as clutch as Kobe. He's a great scorer, but is extremely volatile and prone to going ridiculously cold. And when Harden's cold on offense, he's a massive liability because of his defensive ineptitude (albeit he has improved recently)."
"Picture it now: The Knicks develop into a fantastic underdog story next season, sneaking into the playoffs as a 6/7 seed. They make it all the way to the finals, staring down LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. They proceed to sweep the Lakers.    Whose coaching? David Blatt, that's who. He gives LeBron the Lillard ""bye bye"" as a humiliated LeBron walks off the court.    For those who can't tell, obviously /s"

The Moj Criteria of being a superstar:  Be able to lead a team to a conference championship without another Superstar **OR:** Win an MVP   SUPERSTARs: (not ranked in order of who’s better)  -LeBron James  -Steph Curry  -Kevin Durant  -Giannis Antetokounmpo   -James Harden  -Kawhi Leonard  -Russell Westbrook  -Damian Lillard  -Paul George
What about the guy who landed LeBron James and Anthony Davis and signed a core that has brought them to the #1 seed in the West?  What about the Nets?
"&gt;even gone close with all these Danny Masterclasses.  1) Lebron James  2) Gordon Hayward's ankle  3) Kyrie Irving being injury prone &amp; toxic  Remove one of those and they probably end up in the finals at least once in the last few years. Probably still lose to a healthy Warriors squad, but they could have beaten the shambles of a team that your Raps beat last year.  Also, you seem pretty damn salty for a guy whose team just won their only title in franchise history just this past year. Why so serious?"
"All the greats do this extremely well. The ones I can think of are Lebron, cp3, and Harden that do this a lot . It's called the snake dribble/hold.  Some videos of James Harden and Steve Nash using this move: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAjZVUTc-Kg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDyrFRuEbQ"
"&gt;The question wasn't what is he already doing? It wasn't what more should he do? The question was, what would more public attention get him.   Who cares what more public attention gets Kawhi... Kawhi isn’t in the business of doing good things *for attention or acknowledgement or adoration or approval* or whatever... he’s just doing good things.    &gt;LeBron James has 46M followers on Twitter. Leonard has 430k. What is the difference? James has a massive ability to influence people in a positive way.   Kawhi is still influencing people in a positive way despite being dwarfed in regards to LeBron James’ Twitter following... Claiming James has a massive ability to positively influence people and not admitting Kawhi does too, again, insinuates that Kawhi does not - which simply isn’t true.   &gt;More public attention would give Leonard the ability to influence millions of people. That's an absolute fact, downvotes or not.   I feel like we’re talking in circles here. But I see the point you are making: if Kawhi had more followers he could reach more on top of what he’s already doing.   My point is: people still have the ability to influence a massive amount of people even with the absence of a huge following on social media. Also... do you think the people he’s helping care if he posts about it or not? To some people that could be perceived as patronizing and turn a selfless gesture into tool for self-serving and ultimately tarnish and otherwise wonderful act."
"it's because it's based on pure conjecture and ignores any thought of probabilities. And funny how you automatically assume it's only GSW supporters downvoting u (i didn't btw).  &gt; The rest of the stuff your saying is all numbers that favor Curry because he had a better team.  Are you saying if you swap Curry and Dame last post season Dame will get a 14.2 ppg boost and an 11% TS boost? And Curry will get a 14.2 ppg drop and an 11% TS drop? Because that's just not true. Curry faced a better defence than GS with less help than Dame in the WCF and still dropped 31/5/6 on 60% TS.   And since we are on the efficiency point Curry's Sophomore season with no Klay and no Dray and a team that won 36 games had a higher efficiency than every single season of Dame until this past season. So gimme a break on the efficiency shit. You're chatting shit.  &gt; Well duh he has better players around him and is open a lot more.  Okay. So the only difference between Michael Jordan and James Harden is because Duh Jordan had 2 all time greats around him, loaded with shooters, and is open a lot more. Same for Iverson v Jordan, Jerry West v Jordan. This dumb argument has no basis yet can be used to chat shit about any player.   &gt; Beating OKC? Curry need Klay to go supernova to even get them a game 7...  Curry literally dropped 31/9/10 that same game on 63% TS while being guarded as first option and outscored Klay (and everyone else handily) every other game. You have no idea what you're talking about. I might as well say Lebron needed Kyrie to drop 41 in order to win game 5 and Kawhi needed Siakim to drop 36 to win game 1 of the finals and therefore it doesn't count. Curry was the best player in the OKC comeback. If you dispute that you are caught up in memes or didn't watch the games."

They don’t necessarily have to be guards .. if lebron James was a few years younger I’d say he should be guarding harden ...if imagine PG or kawhi will be matching up with harden most of the game if they meet

"Nash wins a title as the #1a guy, 2x MVP, 8x all star, would be hard to leave him out of the top 20 IMO.  OKC big 3 probably stays together if they beat Chicago. Dirk goes from a top 20 guy to a top 35-40 guy.   Spurs legacy stays about the same, they win 1 title in the Kawhi era  Memphis or Indiana has a huge legacy shift  OKC most certainly beats Indiana. Durant would be an MVP and a 1-2x Champion and 1-2x FMVP.  Harden has a FMVP, Dwight's legacy is much much better  Durant wins another championship and FMVP  San Antonio wins again, Kawhi gets his first FMVP  Harden gets another championship, Chris Paul's legacy is vastly improved  Fairly sure Milwaukee would win unless Dame went supernova.  &amp;#x200B;  This alternate universe vastly improves the legacies of Steve Nash, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, James Harden and Marc Gasol/Mike Conley.  It drastically hurts LeBron James, Steph Curry and Dirk."

"https://sports.yahoo.com/lebron-james-kyrie-irving-and-the-impossibility-of-satisfying-all-of-the-nbas-concerns-231812504.html  “Extremely concerning,” says Zachary Binney, an epidemiologist at Emory University.  “Absolutely,” says Bill Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University.  “Of course, they should be concerned about case numbers around where they’re trying to build their bubble,” says Jared Baeten, an epidemiology professor at the University of Washington.  “Yes,” says Kathleen Bachynski, a public health professor at Muhlenberg College. “And that’s because a true bubble is just really, really hard to create.”   “That is a very serious outbreak, and it’s going to get worse,” Binney says. “This is very quickly approaching scram reactor territory for me. Even with a bubble plan. I’m deeply, deeply worried.  “I still like the NBA’s plan,” he clarifies. “This is not the NBA’s fault. This is the state of Florida’s fault. The NBA has done nothing wrong, other than putting their eggs in the Orlando basket.”  The bubble, Baeten says, is not absolutely impermeable. So its strength, experts say, depends on the environment around it.  “Everybody knows the bubble has to interact with the outside world,” Schaffner says. “The hotel staff, for example. They’re not in the bubble. They’re going to go home to their families, and conduct whatever personal life that they want.”  More virus threats outside the bubble means more chances for a Disney staffer or non-NBA-employed person to bring it in. The chain of events that leads to the infection of an NBA player remains both preventable and extremely improbable. But there will be thousands of opportunities for it to occur. “It would really only take a couple pricks of that bubble, or pops in that bubble, for COVID-19 to get in,” Bachynski says."
"If we're talking possessions, James is playing about 4-6 mpg less now than he was in the mid-2000s, so I think number of possessions is a bit of an oversimplification.  Even \*though there is a 4-8 possessions per a game increase in pace, Lebron is missing that much just in the extra time spent on the bench."
"What happens if, let’s say, the Lakers make it to the finals and Lebron gets the rona between game 1 and 2. Will the franchise make Lebron Fuckin James sit out for the rest of the finals? Also if he has it, then the entire team should be quarantined because of close contact right?  Then what? Will they postpone the finals for 2 weeks? Will they replace the whole team?"
"Pretty likely if he plays 2-3 more season with no injury. I think LeLakers will win at least one chip, so it’s going to be hard to leave off a champion in this decade whose name is LeBron James off the 3rd team."
"I can see the truth hurts, y’all have convinced yourself that Nurkic is worth 13 wins dude LeBron James is barely even worth that much. Once again injuries to role players isn’t going to move the needle for the Blazers, at best it’s a 5 game difference.  I’ve never seen a fan base blame injuries to role player for the season being derailed. Most people thought OKC would destroy the Jazz as well beating a flawed OKC or Nuggets team isn’t something to be proud of.  Let’s see what happens when you were up against a true Superstar in AD oh wait y’all got swept...what happened when you faced the Curry Warriors even WITHOUT KD, oh that’s right y’all got swept....There is a reason why people sleep on the Blazers they get swept a lot in the PS, and with all the influx a great young talent in the west the Blazers time like the Spurs is up."
"It's a toss up. But I'm going with the Lakers. Right now, the Clippers have an edge because they are assured a full roster entering the resumed season. But it's inevitable every team is going to field either a positive test and/or an injury. I have been impressed on how the Lakers have stayed disciplined and have handled varying adversities all season. And they have a healthy and efficient LeBron James and Anthony Davis. MM"
Shannon Sharpe is also a moron who thinks LeBron James is better than Michael Jordan

What did Ingram accomplish with lebron fucking James on his team?
"&gt; Because he and other players were in China when morey said what he said and reporters asked him.  [That doesn't sound right](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/10/15/lebron-james-criticizes-daryl-moreys-decision-send-controversial-hong-kong-tweet/).  &gt; In his first comments since the Los Angeles Lakers returned from playing two exhibition games in China, **James told reporters at Staples Center that Morey was “misinformed or not really educated”** when he posted a graphic on Oct. 4 that read “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.”   Unless I'm quoting the wrong LeBron interview or the Staples Center is in China, they weren't being interviewed in China.  If you're saying LeBron had been in China and he had to say something to the reporters after coming back from the trip, Kerr and Curry had no problem skirting around the issue when they were asked similar questions at around same time. LeBron could've easily done the same but instead he criticized Morey, pretty much the only high profile NBA coach/player doing so."
because he’s Lebron James
"Yea I messed up on Harden's position, I listed him as a guard in this although basketball reference shows he has played most of his minutes at small forward this season, so I moved Doncic to first team and James to second team. FWIW also I'd put Lebron in 2nd for mvp voting right now. And I agree that he's a surefire 1st teamer this year, and yeah, that's not per se because of his defense, which is solid, but because Lillard and Doncic get weighed down from their defense.   "" Like seriously, your all-nba first team list should be your all-offense list as well. ""  This just doesn't make any sense if you can prevent 10 points defensively you're equally as valuable to an offender who can add 10 points."
"The Lakers rebuild started in 2013-2014 and ended in 2018-2019. It took 5 years to land LeBron James despite  signing Mozgov/Deng, hiring Luke Walton, Steve Nash retiring, firing Kupchak, hiring Magic, Jeanie taking over from Jim etc.  The Lakers have 7 of their next 10 picks, plus a swap. If AD leaves they will also have a plethora of cap space. Even in the worst case scenario where AD leaves and LeBron starts to suck the team will still be fine."
"No, Lebron James is having a better offensive season than Jimmy Butler."
Did you just put jimmy butler over LeBron James for all offense?
"It's Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals. Lakers and Clippers are tied 101-101, with Rajon Rondo at the free throw line looking to give the Lakers a lead after having tied the game with the first free throw. He misses the second free throw! JR Smith the rebound! Shot clock is reset, **JR Smith passes to the wide open man**, Dion Waiters, shoots a three from near half court with 22 seconds left in the shot clock, misses badly, Clippers do not call a time out, no OT tonight as Kawhi goes on to hit the game winning corner three, again.  --  LeBron James comes out to the post game conference in a full body cast, he ""banged it against a whiteboard"", winks at reporters saying ""you guys like that, don't you, huh?""."
I too have never beaten Lebron James

" &gt;Here is a direct challenge from me to you...present the exact quote where he talks about HIS finances being in jeopardy  &gt;“So many people could have been harmed not only financially, physically, emotionally, spiritually,” James said Monday  I can see you didnt do too well on your english essays. ""So many people"" does not equate to ""me"". So many people could have been affected like the people from the rockets that have been laid off due to the loss of that income stream. At no point does Lebron talk about HIS finances  &gt;It was at the height of the news coverage for the protests. That was the ONLY time his tweet would've mattered.   Yeah this is bullshit. What evidence do you have in the form of tangible metrics that prove not only this was the peak of the media coverage, but Morey knew about it and had to get his message out at that precise moment. And if Morey was so calculated as to when he had to time his tweet then why did he delete it after?   &gt;No the criticism is that LeBron decided to speak out AGAINST Morey's tweet.   More bullshit. Pop, Steve Kerr, James Harden amongst others were being criticised on this very sub for not saying anything before Lebron called Morey misinformed.   &gt;??? Is that a thing Chinese Nationalists have been known to do? (I'll give you a hint: no)  The situation escalated enough for the nba to beef up security. Im sure they were more knowledgeable on the threat scenario than some redditor"
"&gt;But the protests are still going on to this very day!!!! What difference would it have made had he tweeted 2 weeks later?  It was at the height of the news coverage for the protests. That was the ONLY time his tweet would've mattered.   &gt;The threat to the players safety wasnt just from the state...what if some chinese nationalists had decided to do something stupid like a terrorist strike on the locations the players were in?  ??? Is that a thing Chinese Nationalists have been known to do? (I'll give you a hint: no)  &gt;Here is a direct challenge from me to you...present the exact quote where he talks about HIS finances being in jeopardy  Here you go:  “So many people could have been harmed not only financially, physically, emotionally, spiritually,” James said Monday. “So just be careful what we tweet and say and we do, even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.”  &gt;One more thing...the criticism ive heard is that players and coaches did not speak about the situation.  No the criticism is that LeBron decided to speak out AGAINST Morey's tweet.   &gt;So here is my question to you...what did you want player x or coach x to say?  If they don't care about the situation, I don't want them to say anything."
"LeBron James.  I'm an OKC fan so I've seen my fair share of KD, Russ, Harden, but LeBron is a different breed.  I remember before tip-off he ran and grabbed the rim and swung himself up and slapped the top of the backboard and it was one of the coolest things I've seen."

If we're lucky this new FO will learn from the Cavs and draft lebron james then be lucky enough to have him come back to the team after squandering his first 7 years simply because he was born in a nearby city. Or Id even settle for the competence of getting the #1 pick in 3 of the next 4 drafts. incredibly display of competence.
almost like he's one of the GOATs. if it was Quinn Cook coming up in every thread then that would be living in people's heads. It's fucking LeBron James for crying out loud. Of course he's gonna get talked about in /r/nba of all places. if this was /r/baseball and he was brought up you'd have a point but it's not
Thank god Shams reminded me of LeBron James' last name

Add it to the list.  1.	⁠“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere”- LeBron James, 2016  2.	⁠Condemns Daryl Morey for speaking out against the Chinese atrocities committed on Hong Kong and Ayghur Muslims  3. Condemned Drew Brees in a matter of hours  for saying he doesn’t support kneeling for the anthem  4. Radio silence on Stephen Jackson’s anti-semitic comments 5. Chooses to use his last name versus a social message. Brand is too important. $ too important. Must become billionaire  LeBron James will always only be out for himself.

"Also why would the NBA pick a list of names and have them specifically pick the messages only on that list? And if you're gonna do that, why would you not consult the biggest star in basketball, LeBron James?  This seems like a boneheaded move the NBA all around."
yeah cause the chinese people have never heard of the word 'equality' until lebron james puts it on a shirt

Logic says basically nobody is gonna be playoff ready off a 5 month hiatus. But this is LeBron James we are talking about and the NBA is giving everyone 8 games to get into shape.
"I think to answer this question you really have to sit back and ask yourself ""who is the better player offensively? Steph Curry or James Harden?"".  &amp;#x200B;  With that out of the way, I think the obvious answer is LeBron James."
I don't think he cares lol I mean at the end of the day he's LeBron James.
[Montage of Cavs players missing wide open looks created by LeBron James](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8pteaj/montage_of_cavs_players_missing_wide_open_looks/)   Let me know if you have any other racist conspiracies.
"Yeah with injured players taken in consideration I could see Luka being low top 10 and even being out of the top 10. KD, LeBron, Kawhi, James Harden, Giannis, Steph, AD are clearly in front of Luka I would say. Arguably Russ, Dame and PG are ahead of Luka in rankings."
"&gt; I live in Australia  For fun, watch Delly(aussie) play in 2015 NBA finals.   Easiest way to get into NBA for someone outside of US is to focus on players instead of whole team. Watch some highlights, find a favorite player and then make sure to catch his games. You will get familiar with other players and teams with time.  I'll suggest Lebron James (went to the finals 8 STRAIGHT TIMES, most probably going to the finals this year too), definitely no bias."
"If you start from 1980, thus taking out of ton of the really random guys drafted in the very early days (but also taking out guys like Kareem and Magic), I think he's definitely below average.  Of 40 first picks: LeBron, Duncan, Shaq, David Robinson, Hakeem, Dwight, Ewing, Elton Brand, AI, Webber, AD, James Worthy, Blake, Yao, Kyrie, Bogut, KAT, Wall, Rose, Ben Simmons are better. I'll got out on a limb and say Zion will be, and I think Ayton can be too.   So those are 22 players out of 40.   Then there's Brad Daugherty, Larry Johnson, Derrick Coleman, Mark Aguirre, Danny Manning, Ralph Sampson, and Kenyon Martin who I'm honestly not sure about.   It's also not simply ""half of players are better, half are worse"". You have to consider that a lot of the guys who are better are all-time great players. To even it out you would need an equal amount of all-time bad players."
"There's good suggestions about 2k and how to watch the games.  Only other thing I can suggest is looking up player highlights on YouTube.   Id say start with the current superstars like LeBron James,  Steph Curry, Kevin Durant. A good way to get some ideas on who to watch could be to look up the most recent All Star teams.   After that if you're interested dip into retired players and you can see how the game has changed. Kobe, Shaq, Tim Duncan, and Dirk are some very good recent retired players worth watching. Then if you are still interested you can always go even further back and watch the legends like Michael Jordan.   Another thing to keep in mind is some recent NBA history. The recent cliff notes version includes stuff like: Golden State Warriors last 5 years Lebrons 8 straight finals appearances OKC Thunders big 3 and where they are now Miami Heat when they had lebron wade and bosh San Antonio Spurs amazing dynasty   Last bit of advice if you're looking for good all time players, you can look up stat leaders for points, assists and rebounds etc.  I would say you should support the Cleveland Cavaliers but we're in a bit of a rut since lebron left (for the 2nd time) but you should definitely include the 2016 championship into your research. Feel free to reach out"
&gt;	Who would be the “New LeBron”?  [Idris](https://i.imgur.com/ZEdkzOr.jpg)  &gt;	Who should be cast as the “New James Harden”?  [John David Washington ](https://i.imgur.com/KjSoe7B.jpg)  &gt;	What about the “New KD?”  Probs LaKeith Stanfield   &gt;	And let’s not forget the “New Zion Williamson”.      Fuck it....Wendell Pierce
Because he goes by LeBron James
LeBron James. His ability to always turn it on in the playoffs is why.      Giannis might be the best this season but LeBron deserves benefit of the split decision since he's made finals in 8 of the last 9 years.
"What's crazy is that if you take LeBron's worst box scores from any year (excluding rookie season), it's still a ridiculously good player.  **25.3 - 7.4 - 6.0 - 1.2 - 0.3**  Only 5 players in history have achieved this average pts/reb/ast/stl box score or higher in a season since 1973:  Michael Jordan (1), James Harden (1), Russell Westbrook (3), Larry Bird (4), and LeBron James (10).  Removing the '1.2 steals' requirement, we only add three more players: Luka Doncic (1), John Havlicek (2), and Oscar Robertson (6)."
"I said “black people are at the bottom of the totem pole” in pretty much every country in the world, maybe a bad a choice of words on my part, but I was NOT saying black people are the only marginalized group in the world. The point I was making is that pretty much any country you go to, black people are marginalized and are in some of the least advantageous positions in society. So I have no issue when on the rare occasion someone from one of these communities manages to earn a level of wealth and influence and focuses their philanthropic efforts mainly on the communities that they come from. Such as LeBron James building a school in Akron and Jalen Rose building one in Detroit."
"&gt;CP3  Yeah, he was definitely top 5 in the 2012-2013 season.  &gt;Wade  2012-2013 he was still good but not superstar good. I don't think anyone considered him in the top 5 that season.  &gt;Tim Duncan  He wasn't top 5 good this season but he was probably in the 8th or 9th spot.   &gt;Dwight  He struggled this season with injuries(shoulder and back problems). He declined from previous seasons. This was the season with the lakers that Kobe had to carry them hard and called him soft. He was definitely not top 5 this season.  &gt;Pierce  He was older and definitely wasn't as good as carmelo by this point.  &gt;Harden and Curry  They were good this season but no one considered them to be top 5 good. Curry didn't make an all-nba team and Harden made the third team.   &gt;Rose  He didn't even play the 2012-2013 season because of his ACL injury.   &gt;Idk I saw Carmelo sort of like the VC of the mid 2000s to 2010s, a pseudo superstar but just didn't have what it took to lead a team to win a ring.  nah, Carmelo was a legit superstar and  a lot of players don't win rings. Is James Harden any less of a superstar just because he hasn't won a ring? My top 5 for the 2012-2013 season were Lebron, Kobe, KD, CP3, and Carmelo."
"Pretty good, especially if you define player recruitment from other players as tampering. I don't. It's not tampering until agents and executives start getting involved.   It was perfectly okay for LeBron James to recruit Anthony Davis, it was not okay for both of them to use Rich Paul as a proxy for the shit show that was last year's trade deadline."
"Lol alright...  nevermind.  ""broke"" is not the word you were looking for, but you are going to keep on doubling down on that.   So yeah, he doesn't have as much money as Lebron James .. so he is ""broke""."
"by comparison to the players who have been complaining about food and hotel accommodations...Lebron James, Rondo, Embiid etc.   Yes."
"People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant. We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant. The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better. You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
Neither does LeBron James
"I wouldn't count out Phoenix either. you might laugh because they have been bad but they are young, will have a max cap space unless they do something crazy this offseason. their GM  James Jones, long time teamate of lebron James know a little something about super teams. They have booker, ayton and 3 and D role guys like mikal bridges, cam johnson, javon Carter, who will be going into their prime in year 1 or 2 of giannis's contract. plus If (and its a big if) they draft a quality rookie this offseason. also rubio would be 31 and in the last year of his deal in giannis's first year."
"He’s gotta explore other options a la LeBron James. They’re just not getting it done. Middleton is an elite 3rd guy, but middling 2nd. Giannis needs someone on AD level"
"You didn't mention him:   LeBron James  With 4 titles, I think he becomes the greatest player in NBA history."
&gt;What makes you think they were evenly matched?   LeBron James  Having the best player of the series is a huge advantage. Their regular season difference is not real. The Cavs were the definition of a coasting team while the Rockets were clearly going all in to win as many regular season games as possible.
stop this outrage nonsense -- the jewish community doesn't need the opinion of LeBron James and doesn't care what desean jackson thinks.
"If you can play for more than one season, I'll take the OKC-MIA series from 2012.  Russ, KD, Harden, Ibaka all at age 23 or younger, combined with 27 year old LeBron + Bosh and 30 year old Wade.  **Starters**:   Russ  Wade  James  Durant  Bosh   **Bench**  Chalmers  Harden  Miller  Battier  Jackson  Collison  Sef  Haslem"

"He misquoted it slightly but:  &gt; Among non-blacks, James' negative Q rating went from 24 percent to 44 after his free-agency announcement. However, among blacks, his negative Q Score slipped just from 14 percent to 15 percent.   Source: https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/fl-xpm-2010-09-30-sfl-miami-heat-lebron-james-s093010-story.html"
"2011 Finals  PG: Jason Kidd  SG: Dwyane Wade  SF: LeBron James  PF: Dirk Nowitzski  C: Chris Bosh  Bench: Peja Stojakovic, Jerry Stackhouse, Caron Butler, Tyson Chandler, Shawn Marion"
Aren't the 2017/2018 Warriors basically already considered the best team of all time? Adding Lebron James to that team would probably do it.
"Fuck Hong Kongers and their racist epithets towards Lebron James. I hope you get 0% support from NBA while they reap the rest of China’s viewership. Why should NBA speak up on HK issues? Because they do business there? You racist clowns can fuck right off, you either want NBA on your TV’s or OH WELL.   NOT THEIR FUCKING PROBLEM"
Do care to explain? Lebron James is the 2nd greatest basketball player of all time.
"I read that statement three times. No criticism at all of LeBron James, Woj definitely didn't write this."
"“China responded by flexing its muscle, telling the NBA and LeBron James to ‘shut up and dribble’ and the league obliged.”  Major shade alert in the last paragraph lmao"
Yeah but none of those guys play for NBA commissioner LeBron James
"Why do you defend billionaires and new millionaires defrauding the U.S. tax system with a moralistic argument about what people ‘deserve?’ Zion CHOOSE to go to a league that explicitly forbids payments. That was his choice, he was not forced into it and he was also not forced to take payments. There’s no ‘deserves’ in a choice. Also Universities athletic departments aren’t ‘the rich,’ and all money they get is put back into attempting to fund non-profitable athletics &amp; the university. Why are you trying to defend fucking over thousands of people’s education for 1-10 special athletes each year? You are literally defending the 1%   Now the bigger issue of ‘pay the athletes.’  1. It used to be possible. That’s how you got super teams like UCLA never losing/ Oklahoma in football. The sport didn’t grow as fast because no team could challenge them. They CREATED THE RULE so there’s LESS of an advantage. That’s not to say it 100% removes advantages or stops elite teams from forming, but you don’t say “people still die from car crashes so let’s get rid of all brakes &amp; seatbelts!”  2. As you are in r/NBA you might be unaware most people don’t watch college basketball for Zion/the next prospect. They typically watch march madness and their own university. Most of the ‘brand’ these guys create is going to already existed fan bases. If they get paid for name and likeness, shouldn’t these students also have to pay for the lease to use the colors/uniforms/trademarkof the school? Why isn’t the organizational brand ever given credit? For example Lebron James is worth 100s of millions of dollars, maybe up to a single billion.  The Lakers are worth several Billions, with or without him. That’s the difference. Duke is the true brand. Zion may boost it a bit, but they would’ve hyped up someone. Kentucky, North Carolina are still worth a billion and Zion didn’t go there.   3. Keeping the sport growing with parity, I.e. it’s boring to watch the same teams every year. Did you ever stop to think a single game elimination tournament is probably the worst way to find a ‘best’ team each year? The randomness drives ratings. If you get the top 5-10 prospects all on a single team, Welp who’s gonna win? R/NBA screamed ‘snake’ at KD for joining the Warriors but that’s exactly what name and likeness will create for the college game. Nike and Adidas will publicly offer the bag to athletes ONLY if they join pre-selected ‘elite’ teams (Because they already have the brand). If you know which two teams will be at the end of March madness after a couple years, the ratings will drop. Just like when it was Cavs vs Warriors part 3. Ratings and profits go down? Payouts to athletes go down. Congrats you played yourself.  4. Boosters give money to schools to help athletics AND education. If that money suddenly only goes straight to specific athletes you are also taking funds away from education for the 99% of universities where athletics does not turn a profit. Now you get less scholarships and raised tuition costs for normal people, not to mention those who need the most financial help (but aren’t super freak athletes) get left in the dust.  5. (This is for paying athletes in general, name and likeness would not come from the school). If you start allowing open payment of athletes both via name and likeness + the school, the funding issue compounds. As you have so many sports (The vast majority unprofitable like Women’s field hockey/ Men’s track and field/ etc)  and every athlete gets stipends, free food, free housing, a scholarship. Should they make more, possibly, but know everytime that happens you take money away from EDUCATION again. The University is there for education. They aren’t minor league teams, if you want that go support the G-league so athletes can have options."
"&gt;The warriors and cavs were playing on relatively equal grounds in 2016.  Eh, GSW had a 3-1 lead. Then injuries on Curry/Bogut/Iggy happened &amp; GSW blew it.  &gt;There were no excuses in 2016 heading into the finals. People were ready to see if Steph really was better than lebron or not. Steph was a unanimous mvp and had a way way better season than lebron.  LeBron hasn't won regular season MVP-award since 2013 and many argues he's still top 1 player. Kawhi has won 0 MVPs and is rated higher than likes of James Harden &amp; Giannis. Regular season accomplishments doesn't hold much weight about whoever is NBA's best player. As for Curry, he was amazing in NBA Finals 2016 until he got MCL-sprain."
"It’s time for news coverage about the bubble, no more time for racism and equality or pandemics! Forget about all that!   Mods will be taking down all threads that doesn’t make the NBA money going forward!  💰 💴 💵 💰   So please do your best to ignore real world problems and focus on being a good consumer. Superstars who are far more moral and ethical than you, like Lebron James, will worry about the important things for you, look to him for guidance in these trying times.  Ps we’re only a few days away from Taco Tuesday! 🌮"
"Between Lebron, JR, and Rondo they have to have one of the most unlikeable teams in the NBA. I hope they get clobbered in the playoffs. My knicks are coming for that ass King James and dont you forget it"
it would be easier for you to convince me that the earth is flat than telling me that there were 10 guys better than lebron james. but it is kenny's opinion so i can't hate on it. btw for people saying he has lebron 6th. he said lebron is 11th on a different podcast couple of days ago.
"No, because I don't think that Zion would be half as effective as LeBron at leading a team. James basically acted as point forward and ran the offense on top of being the scoring leader. You're not getting that with Zion, so if he has the same level of supporting cast as James did early on, the team would do worse."
"&gt; Malcolm Jenkins, LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick  because they are all hypocrites  As a HKer, I will never forgive what Lebron did on Morey and I wont forgive him even I am a Lakers fan"
"What i care is that guys that are all about being activists are silent.. yet within an hour are all over Brees.   Im talking about Malcolm Jenkins, LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick,  etc... there true colors are showing... all they care about is if it affects there own people. They could care less about another race or religion."
“Not every issue is everyone’s problem”  -LeBron James
"I think it's more than just him having a collecting hobby. Like, imagine if Lebron James had a hobby of collecting superhero figurines and he packed like 300 figurines for his hotel room in Orlando."
Tf does LeBron James know about doing a bid lol
Does the Knicks have a LeBron James though?
"“Just left the crib to head to the bubble,” LeBron James tweeted. “. . . felt like I’m headed to do a bid man!”  That's a weird one lol"
the LeBron James and Gianns school of muscle building
"Is this really surprising? Lebron James essentially told Morey to stfu when he tried to voice his support for HK. Justice for me, not for thee.  That one really hurt too. Was a huge Lebron fan, appreciate all he has done for the community ... but at the same time if there is no individual benefit, he sides with the money."
"I can't find Kenny's List, but Chuckies is...  &amp;#x200B;  1. Michael Jordan 2. Oscar Robertson**Bill RussellWilt ChamberlainKareem Abdul-Jabbar** 3. Kobe Bryant 4. LeBron James  &amp;#x200B;  Robertson, Russell, Chamberlain and KAJ he said were in no particular order.  Edit: I added Robertson to my last sentence. So Robertson, Russell, Wilt and KAJ are in no particular order 2-5. Which puts Kobe at 6 and Lebron at 7."
The actual comedy of this whole video is Kenny Smith having Lebron James as the 10th best player ever
"yes, because i was on mobile and didn't want to hop around from app to app copy-pasting quotes.   ""“I think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could tweet or could say (could affect people),” James said. “We all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others, and you’re only thinking about yourself.  “I don’t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.”""  [source](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/15/20915339/lebron-james-hong-kong-quotes-daryl-morey)  as far as i know thats the whole transcript. is the 2nd paragraph what you were referring to, or is there a part that i missed?"
"If I had owned a LeBron jersey at that time, I would have burned it. Fuck LeBron James."
"I’m pretty sure LeBron’s comment on this wouldn’t be far off from his response to HK. It seems a lot of these “activists” aren’t out for complete elimination of racism and injustice, they just want to shake up the power rankings and dish it out themselves. That’s not real and meaningful change!  “I also don't think every issue should be everybody's problem as well."" - LeBron James"
LeBron “control your narrative” James
"As much as people LOVE to virtue signal now a days, the sad fact is most people really ONLY care about themselves and their own group. Thats why most of the players support BLM but havent said a single thing about the discrimination of another group by one of their own. You are just seeing peoples TRUE nature and not some fake ""I care about everyone"" bullshit, I mean c'mon remember Lebron James  spoke out against the Hong Kong protesters because it didnt affect him or ""his people"" and he was getting a pay day from it."
"But we're not making national headlines and becoming shining multi-million dollar ""leaders"" of social advocacy like LeBron James. Hypocrisy."
"I agree that we all need to look out for each other, but I think this is unfair.  The same standard is not held for white athletes.  No one calls out white athletes when they don't speak out unprovoked about racially charge comments or actions coming from their peers.  Not only that but Jackson has been out of the league for over 6 years.  How does his comments have any bearing on Lebron James?"
"im trying to understand why people are upset over lebrons HK comments, ive posted this previously:   ""“I think that when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you tweet or could say (could affect people),” James said. “We all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others and you’re only thinking of yourself.”  Lebron and the Lakers were literally in China playing games at the time, they had no idea what the backlash of Daryl Moreys comments would be, that is what he meant... to say that Lebron is anti Hong Kong or pro CCP based off of his statement would be disingenuous.""  I know he didnt straight up say, ""China bad, HK good"", but i dont see anything he said that points to the fact that he supports what china is doing, or even is just blindly praising china for the $$. to me it sounded like he was mainly worried about himself/his teammates/team staff/etc."
"The leader of the NBA, LeBron James, needs to speak out against this clear anti-Semitic racism.  However, I suppose if it doesn't affect him financially or on a personal level, he could care less. (Ahem Houston GM and China)  It's disgusting how silent everyone has been. Really shows you who people really are."
"Steph [actually](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/02/12/forbes-highest-paid-nba-players-list-lebron-james-stephen-curry) makes twice that, $80,000,000 per year counting endorsements. So as a percentage it's equivalent to $175 from the $40,000 person. But of course it's not equivalent -- as you said, you were oversimplifying. To oversimplify a tiny bit less, the $175 means a lot more to someone making $40,000 because of diminishing returns. For someone scraping by, it might be the difference between making a rent payment or paying for a prescription. A person making $40,000 probably saves little, if any money year to year.   On the other hand, Steph covered his necessities, and secured himself a life of unimaginable luxury, about $79 million ago. He's also able to build ungodly amounts of wealth over time. What would $350,000 less mean to him? A smaller 5th yacht?  I understand he's not obligated to donate huge sums to every cause that comes along -- even someone that rich can't solve all the world's problems, and I do think he's entitled to enjoy some of his money. But it is weird to me how these kinds of threads always have a bunch of comments defending the right of the ultra-rich to hoard their money."
"I am very critical of his accomplishments, because I believe that my grandma and 4 of her friends from the Salvation Army could have dominated the East when Lebron did so, but he is in 5th place for me and I believe James will catch Duncan before his career is over. Jordan, Russell and KAJ seem a little bit out of reach though."
Michael Jordan and LeBron James...
We do know that. China was never going to kidnap the Lakers and murder Lebron James. If this was even a slightly realistic outcome then there is no chance that Silver would send players there.

Stevens hasn’t won enough yet and has had a fair bit of talent, let’s see how he’s going in a few more years when the guys have hit their mid-primes.  On the other hand, we know how Spoelstra's done with teams not containing LeBron James. He's missed the playoffs three times and gone out in the first round once and the second round once.   You can tell me those teams were supposed to be bad, but so were this year's raptors."
"If you ranked players by points per game you could also get a pretty accurate tier list. Why not use that?  Here's the problem. You're not using PER to compare players who are entirely different tiers. You're using PER to compare Michael Jordan and Lebron James. You've admitted yourself PER has no use in such close comparisons.   I don't know why you keep on deflecting by trying to make up an imaginary crusade I have against PER. Are you so bad at arguing that the second someone presses against your claims, your first reaction is to say: ""why you trying so hard bro it's not that big a deal"""
"If we're going by ""best basketball player"" no one but MJ has a shred of an argument against James.    Look at any advanced impact stats for the playoffs, MJ and LeBron are both indistinguishable from each other, and ridiculously far ahead of literally anyone else"
Did a single nba player other than lebron James comment on Drew Brees?
"I’m Jewish too. I’ve never felt there’s too much focus on anti-Black racism. My reasoning is that I’m not in competition with any minority. I don’t want concern about anti-Semitism to come at the expense of compassion for Black Americans, which in my view has always been lacking. However, I think it’s fair to say discrimination against Jews, Latinx people, and Asians should get a lot more public attention than it does now.  I think DeSean Jackson should have been immediately cut and probably never hired to play again for what he said. ESPN should have immediately and publicly severed ties with Stephen Jackson. Kevin Durant should have faced serious consequences, perhaps a public statement from his team about why what he did was wrong and maybe a requirement to donate a big chunk of change to fighting anti-Semitism. And there should have been outrage inside and outside the NBA forcing him to apologize and commit to learning about anti-Semitism.  There also should have been clear, immediate statements on this issue from NBA leaders like Adam Silver, Gregg Popovich, and LeBron James.  I don’t think any of what I said should be at all controversial. This wasn’t some borderline stuff. This was clear anti-Semitism. Stephen Jackson and, to a lesser extent, Kevin Durant, are actively supporting someone who is advocating hatred of Jews and voicing support for Hitler. I thought this kind of sentiment, though more widespread than one would hope, was at least taboo in this country.  So, I agree with OP. I am totally disturbed by the lack of public comment from the NBA and from the people and companies affiliated with it. A few isolated ESPN personalities here and there aren’t enough, and frankly they’re going easy on Stephen Jackson and failing to call out KD at all. It’s beyond disappointing, especially because of the long affiliation the NBA has had with many Jews over the years, including the last two commissioners."
It is an NBA sub and they bring up Lebron James? That's crazy!

Remember when Lebron James supported the CCP? Remember how the NBA has a training camp in Xin Jang where millions of Uyghur people are held in internment camps?     These people don't really care about issues besides their own
The ‘18 Celtics were a lot of fun to watch. Just a bunch of young kids and a veteran mentor in Al Horford being a game away from beating LeBron James and going to the NBA Finals.

The only player better than LeBron James is Michael Jordan. Maybe Kareem but come on now. 10th? Smh
"You mean LeBron ""stop criticizing the Chinese, shut up and play"" James?  His PR team is award winning."
Considering that Stephen Jackson is listed several times in the post and he is very much associate with BLM I would say it is on point. The FACT that he and DeSean Jackson made racial posts and BLM who again Stephen is tied to did not come out against it is a fact it happened. So it’s tied to the post and it is a fact. If you want to discredit something you may want to do more than just say it isn’t true.   Stephen Jackson made multiple posts and doubled and tripled down on his position yesterday. No NBA player or member of BLM said anything against it. Those are facts.   Fact I have talked to multiple people who claim to be apart of BLM and while I say racial equality matters they say no one has faced diversity like the black man in this country.  Not only are they quiet on other racist issues but LeBron James essentially told a GM to STFU when speaking about human rights in China.   Sorry blacks people can be racist too. I was on point I just didn’t fit your narrative.
"If you need more than 48 hours to denounce a clearly visible and viral anti-semitic message, you just don't care about it. If you can find evidence where Lebron clearly denounced anti semitism, I'd be happy to see it.  In fact, it sounds like he likes to spread anti-Jewish stereotypes:  [https://sports.yahoo.com/lebron-james-apologizes-sharing-anti-semitic-song-lyrics-instagram-155131217.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/lebron-james-apologizes-sharing-anti-semitic-song-lyrics-instagram-155131217.html)"
"2013 was the closest season he might've been top 5. But Lebron and Durant were clearly better than him since they made 1st team over him.   Additionally, I would say Kobe was also better and top 3 that year with 27/6/6 on 57% true shooting and better defense.   So that's 3 guys already. Then we've got Chris Paul: 17/4/10 on 59% true shooting and 1st team all defense  Then there's guys like Marc Gasol, only 14/8/4, but perhaps the best passing big man that year, and DPOY, and best player on a 56 win Memphis team.  So I named 4 guys that were definitely better. Duncan made 1st team, and while he was past his prime, 18/10 and 3 blocks a game on superb defense is nothing to sneeze at.   Going into the 2013-2014 season Anthony was ranked 8th by Bleacher Report behind Lebron, KD, CP3, Rose, Parker, Kobe, and Westbrook.  Obviously Derrick Rose didn't have a good 2013 season, but the 2014 rankings are based on previous season play and going into 2014, Melo was ranked 8th. He was ranked 10th by SI in the same poll.   I just don't think he has an airtight case for ever being top 5. I think the top 4 in 2013 are Lebron, KD, Kobe and CP3, and for 2013 Melo is with Marc Gasol, Duncan, Westbrook, Tony Parker, James Harden, Dwyane Wade etc."
"There should be a distinction for First Ballot HoF and those who will probably qualify *eventually*. LeBron James, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, etc are first ballot no doubt. Players like Klay Thompson might take a few years but they have a case to make it eventually, you can't be a 3x champion as a key piece to a dynasty and the greatest shooting backcourt in history and not be a HoFer eventually."
"So because lebron James hasn’t condemned Stephen Jackson, he isn’t for equality of Jewish people?"
"Lebron ""We been getting that Jewish money, everything is kosher"" James."

I think we have a good chance but I'm not going to doubt LeBron James after a couple of games. Dude has shown many times that he turn it up when need be. But we do have the better TEAM imo.
Lebron was one of the first to bring back the above the knee shorts I remember. He did in it in 2015-2017.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportingnews.com/us/amp/nba/news/lebron-james-shorts-mustache-cavs-cleveland-cavaliers/1fh2vbxt5kqpo17xuu4x35lz44
LeBron James and Michael Jordan
Damian Lillard - Jimmy Butler - Lebron James - Ben Simmons - Tristan Thompson
"Weird lineups. Optimistically speaking the team is saving it all for the postseason and doesn't want to reveal their hand. Look at Ad and Lebron's minutes. In the postseason they will both be north of 40 minutes probably close to 45 minutes. Against the Thunder Lebron and Ad only played 30 minutes. Another 30 minute game for Davis tonight. James Harden played 36 minutes. Earlier in the night Kawhi played 38 minutes Paul George played 36. Damian Lillard played 40 minutes tonight vs the Blazers.  All these teams except the Lakers seem to be going all out right now. Meanwhile the Lakers are not playing Lebron and Caruso at the same time anymore. They're staying big with Javale/Dwight instead of playing their killer small ball, and the Lebron/AD pnr is not being used. But on the pesimistic side, it's possible they forgot how to play basketball, forgot how to shoot, and Frank Vogel forgot how to coach."

"Jrue AND Davis stopped Lillard (along with the collective Pelicans defense). No one man causes a superstar to struggle like that.   Whether or not AD was the best player in that series (I'd argue he was) is besides the point - he's playing with LeBron James. He doesn't need to be the best player on the floor for LA to win. He more so needs to outplay the opposition, which we can expect him to do in a PS series.  Not 2v5, not buying that LA's support will be this unreliable in a series when the games start to matter. Too many people in here are just assuming Portland around Dame/CJ/Nurk will be lights out in the playoffs while LA role players will crater, as if they have such a track record of consistency."
"because there is an expectation that LeBron James will elevate his play in the postseason to best in the league levels and play almost the entire game, making the Lakers lack of depth less a concern. There's also Anthony Davis who when we last saw him wrecked Portland. With Nurkic."
"Yeah, I'm sure TMZ, the LA media, and everybody else would just ignore LeBron James.  I mean, it's not like there's been news and interviews about/with him every off-season he's been in the league. Nope, as soon as the games are done, LeBron is as invisible on the street as John Stockton."
Fuck. We dont have jrue we only have Lebron James
Probably that he’s the biggest hypocrite in sports.  “Educate yourselves” - high school “grad” Lebron James
They still have Lebron James and Anthony Davis and have been proven to be very good pre bubble.
I think they need to trade LeBron and AD to the Magic for James Ennis
"&gt;playoffs start in 11 days, there are no ""meaningless"" games  Not really. You kind of have a point, but this is technically a ""meaningless"" game in the long run. That's why LeBron James is sitting out. He'd play this game if it was the NBA Playoffs lol  I personally want the Lakers to use the 1st half of games with their 2 superstars to get their offense and defense into rhythm, and the 2nd half for the role players to get into rhythm and to get their shot going as well. There's a risk to reward element the Lakers coaches have to balance out when it comes to their 2 superstars playing full games in the last few games of the regular season before the NBA Playoffs lol"
YALL SEE WHY LEBRON JAMES IS THE MVP NOW? HUH? HUH? HOLY FCUK SAKE.
"Without using any Warriors I'll take a crack   Lebron James, Ray Allen (Celtics Days), Robert Covington, Karl Anthony Towns, Ron Artest"
"That's Jeff ""best teammate lebron james ever had"" Green to you, sir."
They’re down their 2 best guards and 1 Lebron James. That oughta do it
Lebron fears James Harden
are we sure he is lebron james
Because he's still LeBron James and the media is going to interview and film him every chance they get - even if he's just out shopping in the off-season.
"Raptors coach Dwane Casey was visibly shaken by the way Lebron James impacted the game merely by shitting on every other player, on every possession. It was as though Lebron was eating laxatives in the game with his mouth"
LeBron James Hetfield
"He also finishes from 0-3 feet at 75.7%, which is LeBron James/Shaquille O'Neal level"
"Youth, ringless LeBron James, not benching Perkins against the small ball Heat."
Lebron James obvs
"Donald: “Michael Jordan, that no-good loser LeBron James, and of course you can’t forget Usain Bolt. Very fast, very good, that’s what I like!”"
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12299557/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-fit-tweet-was-reference-kevin-love
lol imagine trying to diminish what a healthy Lebron James can do in the playoffs.
You really just compared Kyle Lowry and Joel Embiid to LeBron James lol
"I didn’t say anything about the Uighurs.  You were the one who brought up the genocide in Africa. I just answered you at face value about what I would do.  If Lebron said he wants you to shut up about African genocides victims, it wouldn’t be because he hates Africans or that he values little the lives of Continental Africans. It would be for a financial reason. How do we know this? He sent signals about not talking about Hong Kong when his monies were on the line.  Look I really think we agree here. Lebron James cares about social issues that doesn’t hurt his finances.  Don’t you think we agree on that?"
"I’m not criticizing what lebron said, I’m making fun of the fact center left media people pretend that this is news or has any meaning.  And I really don’t buy your premise even being true. In 2008, I can see celebrities paying lip service to voting mattering. In 2020, if you aren’t voting against trump i highly doubly a comment from lebron James is going to suddenly energize you. It’s not like people aren’t aware of who trump is or can easily ignore him.   Yes, their lives may not be affected by him, but lebron answering a post game question isn’t affecting their lives either."
LeBron James. Been in the league awhile now
Yes and it’s very obvious. You’re telling me the Lebron James we saw at the end of February and start of March is the same Lebron James we’re seeing right now? There’s a reason we have preseason games. You’re crazy to think that half-ass pickups games during the offseason and training camp scrimmages is the same as playing real competition at a high level for 30+ minutes
Oh yes Lebron ccp James is a genius
"Alex Caruso, Stop trying to find a way to FIT-OUT and just FIT-IN. Be apart of something special! Just my thoughts --Lebron James"
"Probably *Space Jam 2* related.  I bet he lost to the Monstars. He's probably shook from that. I mean, who would have believed that LeBron James and the Looney Tunes *could lose*. But I bet they did and now his confidence is gone. Plus he knows that even if he manages to buy a few more championships he'll never match Jordan's legacy now. He couldn't even defend Earth.  That's gotta fucking shake a man to the core."
You think Lebron James hasn’t been training vigorously during the break? The man who spends more than million on his body every year? I don’t think *you* understand how dedicated Lebron is to training and how he has access to pretty much anything he’d require.
Im pretty sure Lebron James is one of the top players in the league
"He doesnt need 4 games to get into a a rhythm or build chemistry off of a 4 month layoff? WHAT????? LeBron James himself, and the past 3-4 games as evidence tremendously disagree with you"
"It's not ONLY about rings, but if you're supposedly #2 all time and only have 3 (which should really only be 2...) that's fucking pathetic.   1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. Bill Russell 5. Magic Johnson 6. Wilt Chamberlain 7. Larry Bird 8. Tim Duncan 9. Kobe Bryant 10. Shaquille O'Neal"
"I have have never heard a player say something like this that you obviously know will start conversations.   PR 101 is ‘we had a ton of time by ourselves to work out, but now we just need to use these games to get back in the groove together. I’m not worried.’  Being LEBRON JAMES on the LAKERS you do not say ‘oh yeah theres a reason we’re ass, but it’s a secret.’"
You think multi millionaires Lebron James hasn’t been conditioning at home?
THIS JUST IN  LEBRON JAMES AND ANTHONY DAVIS GOT CLAMPED BY LUGUENTZ DORT   .... because lebron says there’s off the court drama?  Mother fucker IT‘s sister died and he responded by dropping 53. Shut your bitch ass up
"Yea I do shit on it here a lot, but that’s because I’m fucking passionate about it and seeing how blind people are here pains me. People don’t realize how this ignorance is completely derailing the movement. BLM will fail if it alienated every other race. Without Whites, Latinos, Asians, Jews, etc BLM will fail. The hypocrisy of LeBron James, the bigotry of Desean and Stephen Jackson, the abuse received by supporters who question these, the silence forced upon those who bring up issues, etc. will only alienate these people and ruin the movement.  BLM needs to succeed, but in order for it to succeed it needs to be self aware and be willing to take criticism and self evaluate and self correct."
"Lebron ""Vague Book"" James"
"It's stupid eh? It's literally what LeBron said about Morey and China.  https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/lakers/2019/10/14/lebron-james-addresses-daryl-morey-china-tweet-clarifies-remark/3982048002/  Stay informed, kids."
Good for Lebron but what about the fans? What about me and my family? How will I entertain and feed my family of 4 now? LeChairman is going to far.  He just insulted our president how can he get away with this? Abdul-Rauf is a terrorist and Baghdadi makes Lebron James look like Malcom X.  I planned on watching the nba tonight but I heard about the disrespect given to our men and women who allow us to be free so I won’t tune in. I hope he’s happy.
"Not only is he LeBron James, he's there only legit ball handler at the moment.  It would be profoundly stupid letting him get hurt on a pointless game this close to playoffs."
"Talkin' 'bout LeBron ""China"" James?"
"Ikr? Also man I'm worried about the age factor and his recurring groin injuries but still he is LeBron James who takes his conditioning seriously, I wanna see Lebron win his 4th ring so I hope he proves us wrong and break out of this slump."
"What does that mean, ~~Kobe Bryant~~ LeBron James?"
Ahh the year of [the wrist excuse](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Lebron-james-hand-sports-betting-copy-2.jpg)
"You know what? I actually think you're right. Lebron definitely should do more. I definitely see your point. My only gripe, and the reason I entered the dialog, is that I believe that people are conflating all of the social issues when the comments he made was about BLM and Trump. But I suppose I should not be surprised that people wants to talk China whenever James opens his mouth. I disagree with that, but I understand it."
Lebron “Drama” James
I am all for kneeling . You know exercising your right to protest. But LeBron James specifically can go fuck himself.  #FREEHONGKONG.
i dont give a fuck what lebron james says lmao
That it’s obviously a nickname. You know when they call Lebron “King James”? His name isn’t actually king..
Lebron James and his silence of  Muslim concentration camps  in China is beyond disgraceful
"Misinformed about what?   How the words of LeBron James will have absolutely no impact on a brutal and evil dictatorship that's gone on for 70 years?   Or is it how he's right on a myriad of issues that face black americans and have done a lot of objectively good things to help his community. things such shining a light and funding causes to curb voter disenfranchisement, helping fund a school for at risk kids in ohio and give all students who graduate a full scholarship to the university of akron, or the myriad of other things he's right about in regards to the disenfranchisement of minorities in the US?  i completely disagree with his CCP stance but i think in the grand scheme of things, that one statement pales in comparison to all the good he's done and people bringing it up literally every time to discredit him is ridiculous. even when he's legit right about what he's saying."
Kobe's 7 for 25 shooting in clutch playoff situations doesn't quite convince me.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1649603-comparing-lebron-james-playoff-buzzer-beating-shots-to-michael-jordans-best
"Talkin' 'bout LeBron ""China"" James?"
"It's so frustrating reading all these comments. Everyone is saying that LeBron will turn it on in the playoffs, but last year when LeBron said he turned on playoff mode during the regular season nothing happened. Here is a video of LeBron saying he turned on ""Playoff Mode"" (https://youtu.be/AlM2N0FwBw8)   LeBron tried his best to get the Lakers to the playoffs but to no avail. LeBron didn't post some godly like numbers, he just was regular LeBron.  People may say he wasn't trying and didn't care, but to that I say why didn't he just shut it down? He played in a good amount of games, why risk getting injured?  People here are in denial that LeBron is declining and from my perspective of watching NBA players since 2008, when you're in your 30s, you're aging twice as fast. LeBron is not the same player he was at 34, he's not the same player he was at 33, and he definitely is not the same player he was at 32.  I don't think LeBron is coasting. He NEEDS these games to get back to familiar form. Taking 4 months off and coasting these regular season + scrimmage games and expecting to hit some switch to increase your level of play is not possible. If you look at players who ""hit a switch"" during the playoffs, they didn't take 4 months off from professional basketball, and when they were playing, they were still giving a solid amount of effort. We're seeing a declining LeBron.  Your post is going to age like fine wine. Father time is undefeated, and LeBron James is no exception to the rule."
LeBron James is mad at President Trump but cool with China.  He's a hypocrite.
LeBron James still support the suppression of the Hong Kong people
"Are you serious? That shit was everywhere. But fine, I'll be Mr. Google for your lazy ass lol:  https://nypost.com/2019/01/17/kyrie-irving-apologizes-to-celtics-teammates-and-lebron-james/  https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/celtics/2019/09/27/first-comments-since-joining-nets-kyrie-irving-explains-change-heart-that-led-him-leave-celtics/qBywM9FuZuUlfNhCh1yJMM/story.html  https://brobible.com/sports/article/kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-experience/"
"Your heart is in the right place but he should be fine.   LeBron James was worse during the regular season beginning. Shiit remember game 1 vs Clippers, LBJ looked like super rusty, bad defense and bad offense.   Now compared that to last weeks Clipper match up, totally different.   He will use these last days to back into rhythm, im not worried."
Lebron supports China CCP and has kids making his shoes for pennies a day. Who gives a fuck what Lebron James thinks? Are you people fucking stupid or what?
Is this coming from the person who promotes China and encourages China practices against Uighur people establishing concentration camps.  When do start referring to Party member: LeBron James  https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53481253
Keyboard activists on Reddit posting about China in literally every post about LeBron James correctly commenting on issues that impact minorities in America is so incredibly pathetic.
"I really don’t care what LeBron has to say after his take on Morey RE: Hong Kong.  “James said it was his belief that Morey was “either misinformed or not really educated on the situation” with the NBA and China and insisted that the Rockets general manager hadn’t properly considered the repercussions of his words. ""So many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually."" he said. (ESPN reported earlier Tuesday that James and others had lost lucrative endorsement deals and appearances as part of the fallout.)”.   The NBA, Hollywood, and Silicon Valley (big tech and gaming) all bend the knee to the CCP in exchange for access to such a large population.  Nobody is talking about Hong Kong anymore. How China effectively took it over and enacted laws they plan to enforce GLOBALLY. The Uyghurs having their heads shaved, packed on trains, sent to concentration camps, separated from their families, and forced in to slave labor. They’re cattle prodded if they take too long in the bathroom.  But yeah... “people could have been harmed financially”. lol.   And people are being abused physically, emotionally, and spiritually."
"I would say because single players can make such a huge difference in basketball, it would make sense to define eras by a few players.  1960s - Bill Russell/Wilt Chamberlain/Jerry West/Oscar Roberson  1970s - Kareem Abdul Jabbar/Bill Walton/Walt Frazier/Dr. Julius Erving  1980s - Magic Johnson/Larry Bird/Isiah Thomas/Moses Malone  1990s - Michael Jordan/Hakeem Olajuwon/Scottie Pippen/Shaq  2000s - Shaq/Kobe Bryant/Tim Duncan/Allen Iverson  2010s - Lebron James/Stephen Curry/Kawhi Leonard/Kevin Durant  2020s - Giannis/Luka Doncic/AD/RJ Barrett"
LeBron James is an icon. The idea the America is angry at LeBron is ridiculous.  A handful of people who don't watch the NBA any how are upset.
"Yup, here's the source: https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/lakers-lebron-james-set-to-play-vs-toronto/  I would much rather lose a meaningless game to OKC than have LeBron re-aggravate his groin injury."
Lebron James is the only major celebrity I care to hear less than Trump.
LeBron james is a literal slave owner. Imagine being so dumb you watch the NBA lol
"Of course the Chinese agent LeBron James is going to hope trump loses, he wants the tariffs and what not to be dropped from his handlers"
Thanks  I just ordered 3 pairs of LeBron James shoes
How are you equating her talking shit to LeBron James while surrounded by security with having balls?  This is the equivalent of talking shit to some guy flying solo in a bar while surrounded by eight of your buddies.  You know ain't shit gonna happen to you when you flex.
"For the 2013–2014 to 2015–2016 NBA seasons, I detected statistical dependencies in 23% of all player-seasons. Focusing on a single player, in two of these three seasons, LeBron James shot a better percentage after an immediate miss than otherwise. Conditioning on the previous outcome makes for a more-predictive model than treating free throw makes as independent. When extended specifically to LeBron James' 2016–2017 season, a model depending on the previous shot (single-step Markovian) does not clearly beat a model with independent outcomes. An error-correcting variable length model of two parameters, where James shoots a higher percentage after a missed free throw than otherwise, is more predictive than either model.  [https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.182174](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.182174)"

"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."

Fuck Lebron James for not standing with Hong Kong he’s a hypocrite who only cares about money and attention regardless of human rights.
"Not every issue is everybody’s problem - Lebron James  I kinda agree, why is he forced to care about China when those attacking him don’t give a shit about the plight of black Americans?"
A mistake such as [this one](https://thinkprogress.org/nba-all-star-lebron-james-refuses-to-be-a-witness-against-darfur-genocide-2d3a8fcc2e29/)? Seems like a recurring theme.
"Do you see how fucking dumb we are? Don’t feel bad for us.  Like it’s clear as day, even non Americans have caught on, and yet here we are having posts about LeBron James talking politics after his Uygher Muslim debacle in hopes to sway people to vote for Biden lol"
"Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, LeBron James, Aaron Judge, TJ Warren"
"2021 free agency, only Anthony Davis and the ghost of Luol Deng’s stretched out contract will be on the books if LeBron James opts out.   Theoretically, they could give LeBron $30 million and have AD and another max contract slot option to form a big 3. After the big 3, the star that joins will form a formidable duo with AD. LA+superstar+max contract slot is a recipe for success."
"That’s true, and what the Cavs did was one of the realest “against all odds” narratives in league history. But it is ironic calling LeBron James “David” when he was the “Goliath” of the East for 8 straight years."
"Like, imagine trying to explain typical life in a foreign country to a person like lebron james... the dude hasn’t played a game of basketball since like the 5th grade where the court wasn’t filled over capacity with people who would die to watch him play this game. And now, every move he makes is monitored by billionaires who stand to profit off his success, and his words and actions have legitimately profound impacts on the world. God damn, I’m just happy he’s not a total piece of shit. He actually does some good shit, and invests in communities that need it. I’ll take a dude who ignorant about certain issues over a capitalist opportunist. Maybe he’s both, idk. Let’s stop talking about lebron James"
Because lebron James is an NBA player...
"2014 Finals vs Kawhi: 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 4.0 assists per game. James also shot 57.1% from the floor and 51.9% from the three-point line  2015 Finals vs Iggy James averaged 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 assists. Admittedly his efficiency was not great but he was virtually playing 1 on 5   Now to your statements about 4th quarter performance and being carried by Wade/Kyrie in tight games to win the title:  2013 NBA Finals: In game 6, LeBron had a 30pt triple double, Scored or assisted on 28 points in 4th QTR/OT of game 6 to carry his team back in the game.  In game 7, LeBron had 37 Points, 12 Rebounds, 4 Assists, clutch shot against Kawhi with 35 seconds left. Ray Allen had 0 points in game 7.  LeBron 4th Quarter averages 2016 Finals: 8.1 PPG, 2.9 RPG, 1.7, APG, 22-44 FG(50.0%), 10-13 FT(76.9%).  - In the 4th quarter of Game 7: LeBron: 11pts, 3/8 FG, 4/5 FT, Kyrie: 5pts, 2/6 FG  Also, if he's so predictable and easy to stop in the 4th quarter he must have gotten very lucky to be 7-15 on playoff game winners surpassing MJ and Kobe.  Go back and look at the variety of ways he's hit those shots and please explain how he doesn't have shot creation abilities."
"Also LeBron James: *Hey man don't be calling out Chinese genocide, corruption and how they're in bed with our complicit government. That's where* ***my*** *money comes from!*"
"Source for ratings:   https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2019/11/nba-ratings-decline-tnt-espn/  Source for NBA shitting on America:    https://people.com/sports/lebron-james-fellow-nba-players-kneel-for-national-anthem-in-black-lives-matter-shirts/?amp=true  This is a group of players kneeling for the National Anthem of the United States. The United States doesn’t have concentration camps where organs and hair are harvested from innocent Muslims while they go through a systematic ethnic cleansing, that’s China.   Here is Lebron, the same person kneeling, praising China, and condemning Daryl Morey’s solidarity tweet with the Hong Kong protestors, which were and are being treated far worse than American protestors.   https://youtu.be/UjM43blzaRc  Not to mention this is the country that has allowed these people to conduct business, become international stars, and become rich."
And lebron James view on anything political is important... why?
"Voting Lebron James 2020 has never looked smarter, thanks Bron"
"I'd like to see less ""Zion is fat"" takes and more discussion from real health professionals. What should Zion have been doing at home? What does someone that explosive and big do to optimize their body? [Because it's obvious that he can't just run or lift in the same exact way other guys do.](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/hes-not-normal-zion-williamson-gained-8-pounds-of-muscle-in-a-week/)   The only comparable player I can think of, in terms of having a unique explosive ability and body type, is LeBron. He is blessed to have never had the concerning/scary mechanical issues that Zion does, but when he wanted to put on muscle (without increasing injury risk), [he had to pour hundreds of thousands of dollars into specific trainers, specialty equipment, and knowledgable dietitians](https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2018/05/20/the-1-5-million-expended-by-lebron-james-every-offseason-is-money-well-spent/#216c9a23bc7c). In that context, it's no surprise that Zion, a much less-experienced pro than 2010-ish-era LeBron, struggles while trying to tackle a similar issue--balancing size, explosiveness, bodily stress/injury risk, and basketball skill--during forced time away from the team and gym. SIDENOTE: I am speculating, but there's a chance that the Pels told him NOT to work out intensely. With no trainers or health professionals around, an intense and not-carefully-planned workout for Zion could seriously hurt him.  I don't think, with him, that you can say ""well, go run or bike this much and do this many push-ups and do these drills if you have a hoop."" You have to see and make sure that he is moving correctly/well, and adjust to issue ASAP.   This is all to say that it's just ridiculous to see so many people commenting on Zion. For any young player, this has to have been incredibly difficult. These guys live in the gym, and they couldn't go for months. They still can't work the way they want to, or the way they usually do. If some guys here or there struggle with conditioning or shooting or athleticism, there's reason for concern, but too much is unnecessary. There is so much Zion critique right now, and fans should shut the fuck up about it. I'm grateful that he's healthy, and will trust what medical professionals say about him, and that's it."
Lebron James 15th
"If there is one thing that has been good for you since 2013, it has been your ability to sign Lebron James as a FA and getting AD to force his way onto your team."
- Giannis Antetekoumpo vs James Harden  - Damian Lillard vs Russell Westbrook - Damian Lillard vs Paul George/Patrick Beverley - Lakers vs Celtics - Damian Lillard vs Shaq (Rap Beef) - Robin Lopez vs Mascots - Lebron vs Raptors - Kevin Durant vs Russell Westbrook
"You see examples of it all the time, it doesn't mean that its a lasting effect, because its all human emotion. Suddenly the other team is on a run, you're out of it because Lebron James just boomed you 3 of the last 4 possessions, and you're begging the coach to call TO so you can get your head back. Momentum doesn't last in sports, that's why you won't find any statistical information behind it. You would somehow have to be on the court and do some sort of psychological evaluation of each player, which is obviously ridiculous.      The hot hand/momentum definitely exists, Klay's 37 point quarter is pretty much the definition of it. You perform better when you feel better, I don't think that's hard to wrap your head around. Seeing a few buckets drop in quick succession definitely gets the blood flowing."
I’m from year 2323 and LeBron James is contemplating retirement while in his prime.
"Once you achieve a certain level of stardom, you only got by one name is this league.  Jordan. Kobe. Lebron. Harden. Kawhi. Leonard. Giannis.  No one ever uses the ""James"". So I'm not sure that his last name matters."
"So apparently he doesn't technically own any shares, the NBA investigated it and players aren't allowed to have any stake in agencies.  Now because it's run by Rich Paul we know it is just a proxy for LeBron. But the league can't do much about that even if they wanted to; enforcing a ""you can't be friends with your agent"" rule or something like that is impossible.   &gt;According to ESPN's Brian Windhorst (h/t Ryne Nelson of Slam Online), the league looked into whether James had any ownership, but no evidence of an ownership share was found.  &gt;NBA players are not permitted to own a stake in agencies.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2725078-nba-investigated-lebron-james-potential-stake-in-klutch-sports-group"
"Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."" Same applies to giannis who is a big elite 2 way wing."
300 year old Jordan actually just stepped into the court and played himself after LeBron James Jr Jr Jr Jr Jr Jr Jr said he was better
"Kareem forced his way to the Lakers in a ridiculously lopsided trade. They also got James Worthy because the fleeced the cavs for the draft pick.  The Warriors signed a free agent player for a max contract when they had the cap space.  It isn't like an all star took a sub-market contract to join them.  Do the Shaq-Kobe lakers also have asterisks on their championships? Shaq signed as a free agent with the Lakers.  I assume you also think the Lebron Heat also should have an asterisk? They clearly formed a super team that broke the balance of the league.  What about the 2008 Celtics? They formed an unfair superteam. Or is that different because it was a trade? Why would a trade change anything?  If the Warriors had instead done a sign and trade for KD (with Barnes going to the Thunder, for example), would that make the championships legit?  You can be as mad as you want at KD for his decision, but the idea that the championships deserve an asterisk is ridiculous. The idea that if you are able to put together a team that is 'too good', you somehow have to call into question a team's success is absurd. Those Warrior teams had 3 homegrown all stars and 1 free agent signing all star; almost all champions in the last 30 years had at least one big free agent signing."
"hell no, Zion will be in the discussion of GOAT if he can stay healthy. It's like not picking LEbron james"
"Here's some clown named Greg Logan's votes.

1. League expands to 32 teams  2. Giannis gets a ring  3. Knicks sign an all star   4. Suns make the finals at least once  5. Someone like Brad Beal signs with the Lakers after Lebron is gone   6. Bronny James is a solid role player on a team but not a star  7. Mikal Bridges wins DPOY  8.  One of the Pelicans/Grizzlies/TWolves move to the eastern conference   9. Adam Silver retires before the end of the decade  10. NBA adopts top 16 teams getting into playoffs regardless of conference
"Zion is a rookie. Mind you Lebron James, universally seen as a top 10 NBA player now and of all time, could not get this unit to the playoffs."
Naw in by then Lebron James Jr Jr Jr Jr Jr will take the world by storm and be the unanimous Goat
Wtf lmao its like the exact opposite. This sub is gassing Portland wayyy too much since the bubble started. They are obviously a good team and with a good run could beat almost anyone but people are acting like the Lebron James Lakers should actually be afraid of them in the playoffs. It’s like when people used to act like the Raptors were gonna knock out the Cavs
"The Cavs had prime LeBron James. Kyrie has struggled with injuries since then and now has a KD fresh off a torn Achilles. Not to mention the Cavs had some guy named Love who was an all star as well.   Im not saying the Nets will be bad, but the most hated teams are usually dominant as well."
"I think there was a post saying that you could make $7,000 per hour from the birth of Jesus until today and Jeff Bezos would still have more wealth than you.    As rich as Lebron James is he has an estimated net worth that is 0.26% of Jeff Bezos estimated net worth.  As much as these NBA guys are making it's really pennies compared to like the 400 riches billionaires who have more than like 250,000,000 people combined."
"Skip: If you replaced Michael Jordan TODAY with Lebron James, we would not be having this conversation about the Blazers vs. Lakers."
"tbh your point has a lot of merit if we just look at the old playoff posts from 2017-2019. anytime the kd warriors lost its then being choke artists and needing 4 all stars to beat lebron solo, or that james harden and old ass chris paul took them to 7 games    but when they win its theyre overpowered and theres no way anyone could have beat them blah blah. like i get if its just trash talk like how ronaldo fans talk down messi but theres people on this sub that actually believe that durant can simultaneously be the biggest choker and weakling in the nba, and still make a team unbeatable and unfair"
Be LeBron James
Because i’m not talking about the cavs team or the miami team. i’m talking about the individual. From an individual standpoint 8 straight finals being a top player on the team is impressive regardless of competition. So it would make more since to say after his first stint in Cleveland what if he went out west and joined a contender like he did with miami. So if we are saying a 26 year old Lebron James went west and joined a good and competent organization would he be able to go to 8 straight finals. Given his track record... probably.
G: James Harden. G: Luka Doncic. F: LeBron James. F: Giannis Antetokounmpo. C: Nikola Jokic.  This is my prediction and Luka is most likely to bounce this year in the first round.
"Case studies don't support this idea. Steph Curry, James Harden, Lebron James, Russell Westbrook, Derrick Rose, literally every single modern player I could think to compare Trae to sees their counting stats and advanced stats drop when paired with higher usage teammates. Trae is undeniably great offensively, but I'm so fucking tired of hearing people repeat 30 and 10 when it says more about his usage than value and also completely ignores his massive deficiency on defense."
"speaking of the Laker, I know for certain that AD and Lebron were threatened with tampering, i believe on multiple occassions. I don't think anything ended up panning out, but they were definitely being considered for it.      Source:  [https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/nba-issues-tampering-warning-amid-lebron-james-anthony-davis-situation](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/nba-issues-tampering-warning-amid-lebron-james-anthony-davis-situation)"
"My top 3 is wilt chamberlain, lebron James, Bill russell. Its a bit odd but i dont think michael Jordan has anything that at least one of these guys wasnt better at"
Lebron James partially owns a sports agency that demands Anthony Davis gets traded to the Lakers and publicly states it would be amazing to play with Anthony Davis but this is what gets the first player tampering fine.  Seems legit.
**Offense:**  - LeBron James  - Michael Jordan  - Larry Bird  - Kevin Durant  - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar    **Defense:**  - Kobe Bryant  - Kawhi Leonard  - Scottie Pippen  - Kevin Garnett   - Hakeem Olajuwon  No small ballers in my lineups
Because being ROY doesn't come close to meaning one of the 'best' or 'most valuable'.  Luka deserved ROY.  But he wasn't nearly this good last year.  And he isn't *yet* on the level of LeBron Jame or James Harden.
It's between LeBron James and Antetokounmpo. James Harden and his flopping and his freethrows doesn't deserve to be on this list.
"Inflated pace. If young LeBron just entered the league in 2018, he’d be putting up better numbers than that right now. Because he’s LeBron James."

But LeBron averaged 31/7/7 with more impressive advanced metrics while also being runner up in MVP voting and leading his team to the second round of the playoffs. How is that worse? I say that as someone who usually spends a lot of time arguing against LeBron James...
"The media has such a big boner for LeBron James, I swear the bias is real."
&gt;MVP: LeBron James  [closes post]
James has in first name James last name Harden or James is in last name James first name LeBron?
"Exactly. Just the fact that there’s so many different answers in this thread itself shows that the next LeBron isn’t here yet, and probably won’t be for a while. LeBron has been King James since high school."
People made fun of me when I compared him to LeBron James before the draft. :x
Here’s an interesting breakdown:   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-havent-seen-anyone-like-luka-doncic-since-lebron-james/
How are they ignored though?   To say they are ignored implies people are overrating him or something.   I haven’t ever heard someone say he’s the best point guard or better than James harden.   Harden gets shit because he’s a perennial MVP candidate who chokes. Lebron gets it because he’s the self proclaimed king.   Dame is just chillin.
"LeBron James is a role player. His role is ""run your team's offense and score a bunch"", and he plays that role."

Not every day you get to see the BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD and lebron james go head to head. Great game
Where were you when Goga Bitadze locked up Anthony Davis and TJ Warren dropped 39 on Lebron James?
[Serious] Should the Lakers trade Anthony Davis and LeBron James to start from scratch?
"Today you had arguably one of the GOATs on the court, as well as LeBron James."

"New G.O.A.T. debate: Michael Jordan, LeBron James, &amp; bubble TJ Warren"
Where were you when TJ Warren almost dropped a 40 piece on Lebron James and Goga Bitadze locked up Anthony Davis
TJ Warren is literally better than Lebron James and Anthony Davis combined
Lebron James is still good
"LeBron James took the worst team I've ever seen (go to) to the finals, in his fourth yr.     Zydrunas Ilgauskas was #2.   3rd was a rat race between Delonte West and vagabond Wally Szczerbiak.    Allen Iverson took an almost equally horrible team to the finals in his 5th yr.        The Bulls were literally the greatest team assembled, until maybe recent GSW.    How the fuck can you even compare them to the Cavs.    Oh, I know why.  You;re a fucking idiot."
"Until LeBron craps the bed ala 2011 Finals, LeBron James should still be the most feared man come playoff time."
And LeBron James just answered everyone why he is in the MVP debate. +14 in 6 mins with Dudley and G leaguer THT. don’t doubt the KING
James Johnson plays like LeBron / peak draymond in 2k in terms of sprinting down the court and making tough layups lol
Lebron with Mike James shooting actually would be pretty solid.
"Pat Bev, LeBron, Kuzma, Draymond, James Hitler"
The only thing that is letting lakers to be favored in any series right now is Lebron James playoffs history.
Epic match up at the 4 spot between a raging hot mvp candidate and LeBron James.    Tj going to drop a 40 piece on the old head
"The sophomore leap hardly ever happens like this.  Find people who made the leap Luka made.  He’s in the company of Shaq, KD, Lebron - players who seriously stepped their game up in year 2.  Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Brandon Ingram,  Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Lonzo, D’Angelo Russell, Kristaps Porzingis, Andrew Wiggins, John Wall, Demarcus Cousins, James Harden, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, etc were all picked early and none of them took this type of jump.  It’s not normal."
"&gt; No, I just think you’re overrating not only the current roster of the Lakers but the effect FVV would have.  Fred VanVleet is an extremely good player and has valuable championship experience in addition to averaging 18/4/7 with elite defense. The current Lakers roster has clinched the #1 seed in the Western Conference over the Los Angeles Clippers. He solves our one problem, which despite having we are already favorites, and makes us a complete team.  &gt;I didn’t say it doesn’t make them better. I just said it doesn’t make them overwhelming favorites over the Clippers or Bucks. You’re probably operating from a place where you think the Lakers roster is already on par with those teams and that’s fine for you to have that opinion. It’s also fine for me to have the opinion that it’s not and that adding FVV makes them even and maybe even better. Just not OVERWHELMING favorites  Do you really hate the Lakers or something? The Lakers roster is already on par with the Clippers and Bucks roster and has two superstars, LeBron James and Anthony Davis, that had led their team to the 1st seed in the Weet. Depth is extremely overrated in the playoffs, superstar talent matters much more. They are already favorites over the Clippers and Bucks to most people.  You can believe whatever you want but most people would believe that adding VanVleet to a team that most people already consider a slight favorite would make them the overwhelming favorites"
What’s more impressive going from 8 to 16 or 22 to 29ppg?   I’m taking the 22 to 29. There’s levels to scoring and Luka is now in the tier with James harden/Lebron/KD/Curry where he can go get 30 any night he so chooses.
He has Lebron James and Anthony Davis on his team
"No, the superstar free agents went where the most money was. They always did. They didn’t take pay cuts to play with another star and give themselves an easier chance to win. The vast majority of “super teams” of the past were constructed through the draft and through trades. That didn’t change until LeBron James established the precedent of star players leaving their original teams as free agents to take paycuts to play with each other rather than against each other. Purely in terms of “what will give me the easiest and best chance of success” this is a smart move. But purely in terms of competition? It’s weak and not entertaining in the least bit (except for the fans of those players/teams.) So no matter what the downvotes say, I have never and will never respect any star who’d rather take less money to play with other stars than take more money to compete against them and prove their worth."
"You don’t know when LeBron is retiring unless you’re Rich Paul, Savannah James, Randy Mims, or Maverick Carter"
"Because historically the award is meant to recognize something seperate from Lebron James, or Luka Doncic, going from year 1 to year 2."
I honestly think the Lakers are in trouble against anyone not named Utah/Memphis the way they’ve been playing. I get the whole “coasting” thing for Lebron/AD. But these other guys don’t have that luxury. And they’ve all looked like pure dog shit besides Kuzma and Dion for a couple games. Everyone else looks terrible. Danny Green couldn’t beat me in a 3 pt contest right now. Teams are running a fucking zone against the Lakers because of how terrible their shooters are. A zone against Lebron James means your shooters are dog shit and the other team knows it. I pray to god they get their shit together.
Imagine people really thinking LeBron James is scared of the blazers.   He's coasting. How many years do we really have to say he's playing bad right before playoffs only for him to dominate his way into the finals again?
"YOU KNOW THEY SAY ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. BUT YOU LOOK AT JAMES HARDEN AND YOU LOOK AT GIANNIS AND YOU CAN SEE THAT STATEMENT IS NOT TRUE! SEE NORMALLY IF YOU GO 1 ON 1 WITH ANOTHER PLAYER YOU GOT A 50/50 CHANCE OF WINNING! BUT GIANNIS IS A GENETIC FREAK AND HE’S NOT NORMAL! SO HARDEN GOT A 25% AT BEST AT BEAT GIANNIS! AND THEN YOU ADD LEBRON JAMES TO THE MIX, THE CHANCES OF HARDEN WINNING MVP DRASTIC GO DOWN! SEE THE 3 WAY MVP RACE YOU GOT A 33 1/3 CHANCE OF WINNING. BUT GIANNIS GOT A 66 2/3 CHANCE OF WINNING CAUSE LEBRON KNOWS BOTH HE AND JAMES HARDEN CAN'T BEAT THE GREEK FREAK AND HE'S NOT EVEN GONNA TRY! SO JAMES FUCKING HARDEN YOU TAKE YOUR 33 1/3 CHANCE MINUS THE 25% CHANCE AND YOU GOT 8 1/3 CHANCE OF WINNING AT MVP. BUT THEN YOU TAKE GIANNIS’S 75% CHANCE OF WINNING IF THEY WAS TO GO 1 ON 1 AND THEN ADD 66 2/3 %. GOT A 141 2/3 CHANCE OF WINNING MVP! SENIOR JAMES? THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE AND THEY SPELL DISASTER FOR YOU AT ORLANDO!"
"Yeah but because of Covid, the Lakers have a fully rested LeBron James lol"
"Because we are talking about the scenario and situation in which he is taking the ball to the basket with the intention to score every time, in which it becomes predictable and you can double, triple, pack the paint, whatever you want.  His scoring does not scale well unless he has endless spacing and another elite player. If you think Lebron James can score the same amount of points facing the same defense that James Harden, Steph Curry, Kobe Bryant, or MJ face / did face, I have no idea what to tell you.  It’s really not a criticism. The right play in 90% of those situations is to pass. And Lebron makes the right play 90% of the time, which prevents defenses from gambling to double / help. Which in turn allows him to reliably and efficiently score 25-35 ppg. Look at the game look at the film. Ain’t no one doubling Lebron at any time. Because Lebron will kill you with the pass. The one series where we KNEW, 100%, LBJ has no alternative, his teammates are garbage, he’s going to take it to the basket every time or die trying, he shot 41% over a 20 game sample size. That can’t be written off as an outlier lmao.  This is why the LBJ system demands spacing and usually at least one other elite player."
He isn’t better than Michael Jordan or LeBron James. Some of LeBron’s Cavaliers playoff runs were far more impressive than any of Durant’s Golden State runs considering he had a disgraceful amount of offensive talent around him and still managed to be incredible.
Imagine placing Michael Jordan or LeBron James on those Golden State teams. They’d put up just as monstrous numbers. They put up absurd stats in multiple playoff runs without anywhere near as good of a team as Durant did. It’s laughable to consider to him the greatest scorer ever. He’s not even top two.
LMAO Space Jam 2 gunna be a mockumentary crime noir with Lebron James hunting down the aliens in the bubble
Well that's because they are honestly. You guys have LeBron fucking James and AD. We have our work cut out for us
"This happens every year since year 14  He then turns it on in the playoffs and we go back to ""HOW DID WE UNDERRATE LEBRON JAMES""  It's so fucking annoying"
"Contrary to popular belief neither LeBron or the NBA are elected officials. Anybody concerned about BLM should write their representatives.  See how that works?   You cannot be as political a league as the NBA and be as egregiously silent as they've been on China. It's fucking hypocritical. LeBron James can absolutely make Nike or even the NBA, pull out of China.  Imagine LeBron pulling the most famous athletes in the world to pressure corporations and politicians to stop the genocide."
"That's because the Mavs didn't have a one and done superstar come in to win their title for them. They had a likeable, homegrown superstar go on an insane to finally win one against LeBron James who everyone loves to hate on"
It's not at all a joke. The Clippers probably have 3 guys in the top 10 at defending LeBron.  Marcus did it with the Pistons and he kept doing it with the Celtics. It's not like he locked him down. It's LeBron fucking James. But he did a great job.  https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2018/05/16/marcus-morris-remains-celtics-best-defender-vs-lebron-james/
"Don't think you could have found a worse source if you actively went out looking for the worst one (who knows, maybe you did). It's firstly, clearly subjective and secondly is behind a pay wall. How about we take a look at James's own words without any added noise? Here are his tweets posted after his initial interview:  &gt;I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. **I'm not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that**  &gt;My team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. **Could have waited a week to send it**  I don't know how anyone can read this an think LeBron is giving his opinion on the China-Hong Kong situation itself as opposed to Morey's tweeting.

"Taking *less* and *easier* threes on a shittier percentage makes him better? LMAO. That ""era"" bullshit doesn't matter when Kobe had multiple seasons with 5+ three-point attempts. He took threes and wasn't good at them.  Also, you're a fool if you don't have LeBron James as a top three offensive player ever and even more foolish if you place Kobe Bryant ahead of him.  &gt; Prime Kobe, who shot better from 3 than Harden has shot over the last two years.  Kobe Bryant has one (1) season with a higher 3PT% than prime James Harden (36.7% on 13 attempts last season). Guess what? He took *less than a third as many threes* (4.0) and the vast majority were assisted.  &gt;  If Prime Kobe was playing in 2020 he'd drop 40 a night.  LMFAO.   If you're gonna reply with more arbitrary, nonsensical, nostalgic garbage, do me a favour and don't lmao."

Will Lakers regret signing lebron james now that he's washed? Dude lost to PASCAL SIAKAM of all people yikes.
"Alright, alright. I would understand this if the NBA was totally silent on China and right wingers kept trying to butt in with “but China” simply to deflect bringing attention to our deep-rooted problems.   But you literally have superstar LeBron James calling out Morey’s support of Hong Kong as being “uneducated on the subject” and then Commissioner Adam Silver dismissing their human rights violations as “they have a different way of doing things”. It’s not that they’re not acknowledging China, they’re *enabling* it"
"Careful bro, Comic Sans Dan’s plantation letter sounded like he owned LeBron.  Edit: Even LeBron thought it was racist  https://www.gq.com/story/lebron-james-greatest-living-athlete"
LeBron James Defense is 2013 offense 2018
"Bruh, that entire sample size was 47 players. That means only 8 players in the ENTIRE league voted Westbrook overrated LMAO. The players already don't take voting seriously, you think they took that poll seriously? The only players that took that seriously is players that have beef with another player. Westbrook and Draymond were tied for first, who are two of the biggest shit talkers and more hated players in the league? Westbrook and Draymond. How many players does Westbrook have 1 on 1 beef with in the league? I guarantee you it's about 8, the number of players that voted for him. Also, James Harden and LeBron for tied for 6th most overrated. Use your head dude, you really took that entire poll seriously? LMAO  It's sad how much effort you're putting in to hate on a game that doesn't even know you exist.  Edit: Also every one of Westbrook's ex-teammates have had nothing to say but good things about how he made them better and was a great leader. I'd take the word of those players over players that are just salty"
"Draymond Green is just recruiting new clients for Rich Paul and Lebron James.     For sure he texts young good players to consider Klutch, selling them the idea that Klutch can get them to Lakers or some other big city team.  &amp;#x200B;  The NBA dont really care either because it brings money and profit either way...."
We're talking about the 2nd GOAT here on a roster with multiple top picks that are all playing well on their respective teams now. The amount of excuses LeBron James gets is embarrassing. Not making the playoffs should be a huuge stain.
Oh yeah well I think Dame is going to make Lebron James his girlfriend and the Blazers will beat the Lakers in 6. Therefore my opinion negates you’re opinion and we are back to square 1 holmes.
"Ok yea but the lakers also have lebron james and ad lol. Mavs def need a better third option, ideally a ball handler"
Tatum dunking on LeBron his rookie year. So kind of James to roll out the welcome wagon like that
"You're asking for proof that the media will still consider *LeBron James* news, even in the off-season?  Yeah, you're an idiot."
I wonder what LeBron James’ career PPG average will be when he retires. I’d say about 26.0 since I don’t see anymore 26+ PPG seasons from him.
"I believe him when he says it because I've seen what he's capable of and understand that scoring isn't his main goal. As I said, if scoring titles was the measuring stick, he'd have won *repeatedly*.  &amp;nbsp;  Here's Coach Spo saying, ""He could average 37 points a game, realistically I think."" back in 2012 - https://www.espn.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/8772666/lebron-james-says-lead-league-scoring-not-my-job-miami-heat"
"That statement about Kawhi has nothing to back it. Whereas it's easy to see how close LeBron was to having many scoring titles if he'd just taken a couple more shots per game. Or actually cared about winning scoring titles. If that was the measuring stick, he would have won repeatedly. Do you understand? - https://bleacherreport.com/articles/369343-report-i-could-win-the-scoring-title-every-year-says-lebron-james"
"Yeah... not that I want to put too much into the bubble games, but whatever steam James had going into the bubble got demolished, I not simply because his game was sub-par (by LeBron standards), or that the team played poorly, but also his ""off court issues"" comment sounded like throwing teammates under the bus.    His 'MVP' narrative feel through basement floor with that."
"He's doing good in LA because he has two players called LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Just like Coach ""Co-coach of the year"" Bud is doing well in milwaukee because he has a player Called Giannis asdjfbasdihfvakounmpo. Just look at how disgracefully awful those two teams are when the 3 mentioned players step off the floor."
"&gt;The scoring title goes to James Harden with 34.3ppg &gt;This is Harden's third straight scoring title (30.4, 36.1, 34.3). This guy is insane and shows no signs of slowing down.   To put that into perspective, Kobe only has 2 scoring titles, Kareem only won 2, Shaq won 2, Lebron only has 1, Larry Bird has 0 of these things."
Since when are Curry/Klay injury prone other than this last year (and rookie curry ofc)?? Zion sure but that's why I listed like 17 ppl out of 12 all stars.   And you rly don't think LeBron fucking James will be an all-star due to time management 🤦‍♂️
"""LeBron James doesn't try as hard in games that don't matter. More at 11"""
Luka is a lot more like James harden and LeBron. A lot of people get stereotyped based on their body type as much as race as well
"The majority of things you listed aren't matchup specific and teams answer the majority of questions about those regardless of opponent. There's gameplanning but it comes with how you're going to manage your roster for specific scenarios, not how you're going to react to the unique attributes of specific players and teams. It's entirely different from practicing and preparing for different playstyles -- a batter isn't going to run different drills for a different team, a fielder isn't going to have to field differently. The manager is going to have their homework done, their list of analytics, and they're going to swap in the player they feel best fits each scenario. Mike Trout isn't going to have to watch game footage of Giancarlo Stanton like Kawhi Leonard is going to study LeBron James.  Not simplifying anything, just being on topic. And you seem defensive about baseball, to which I wasn't putting down, just pointing out the basic fact that it's a different sport."
"There's two tiers of super stars, LeBron James and the rest."
"&gt; One reason for this decline in fringe MVP candidates may be that the NBA now publicizes every voter’s ballot, a practice that began in 2014. Before then, when a voter wanted to go against the grain and vote for Carmelo Anthony over LeBron James for MVP, that voter did so anonymously. But since 2014, every media member’s ballot for every award is public record. This puts pressure on voters to submit ballots that don’t stray too far from the consensus unless they want to be publicly shamed.  They say it’s because everyone votes the same way.  I say it’s because the results are announced in the post season"
"You seem to have forgotten about Lebron James.  He might've played bad against you guys in the bubble but he's still Lebron James.  So I disagree, I would have the Lakers in 6 against you guys."
Lebron James
#1 - LeBron James #2 - Kawhi Leonard #3 - Giannis Antetokounnpo #4 - James Harden #5 - Nikola Jokic #6 - Damian Lillard #7 - Anthony Davis #8 - Luka Doncic #9 - Joel Embiid #10 - Paul George  Some Notes:  #1 - AD too inconsistent for me to put in top 5 as oppossed to the 2 clutchest players in the league in Lillard and Jokic. #2 - Playoff LeBron has gained my trust through the years enough to put him #1. Same with Kawhi to a certain extent. #3 - I put Doncic over Embiid &amp; George because Embiid is injured and inconsistent and PG's playoff track record the last two years isnt all that great.
*LeBron James likes this*
Still not it. The Lakers were not using their death lineups against these teams besides LAC and Utah. Javale Mcgee is still playing center not Davis. Lebron James is still largely playing like a traditional point guard. Caruso and Lebron are being kept apart despite being the best duo in the league until the bubble.   Against Denver KCP did not play for rest reasons and for experiment with lineups reasons. Against Indiana Dion Waiters and Danny Green did not play for rest reasons and for experiment with lineup reasons. Same deal with Dwight Howard against OKC and Lebron against Houston. Get the picture?  And 35 minutes is light work for LJ and Ad. In the playoffs they will both be in the 45 minute range. That's when they are trying.
He showed up so far in 15 playoff games (9 of which he played against the Warriors)  And he showed up against the Blazers too   What’s stopping him from dropping an efficient 31/14 again?   Especially now when his teammate is Lebron James lmao?
&gt;Phoenix is a better long term destination  Says who? Says no free agent ever.  Yeah. But that star is LeBron James. Who at the back end of his career is still a top 3 player in the league.  Yeah. But there's no guarantees like you said.  And LeBron has 2 yrs left. So LeBron won't be gone for 2 yrs. Enough time to win a championship.
"&gt; Brother, KCP, Danny Green, and Alex fucking Caruso aren't going to stop Lillard a bit more than Nurkic and Whiteside are going to stop Anthony Davis.  Yeah, Anthony Davis and LeBron James are gonna help a bit too.  You’re really disrespecting Caruso. He’s a great defender that matches up well with Lillard.  &gt;He's torched LA in every game this year. The most recent contest being the game he dropped 48 on LA and they actually had Bradley for that.  Bradley is worse than both KCP and Caruso. The Lakers are 2-1 against Portland this season and Dame had to drop 48 to get that single win.  &gt;Nobody on that team is going to stop him. The way LA will beat Portland is by stopping their role players and giving McCollum some issues. Dame could average 40ppg in this series and I think Portland will still lose in 5-6 games because they can't do shit to stop AD and LeBron in a 7 game series.  Dame is averaging 37 ppg in the bubble against mediocre defenses and barely winning against shit teams. He’s not doing shit against a top 3 defense."
and who on your team can guard LeBron James or Anthony Davis lol
"Lakers in 5, if Lillard has to avg 45 pts to keep them in the playoffs I dont see it happening. Theyve never faced Lebron James."
