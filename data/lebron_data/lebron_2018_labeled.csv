He started in OGs place early in the season and struggled Went down with an injury for a couple games and OG claimed his spot as the starter The bench mob VanVleet Wright Miles Siakam Poeltl lineup was born and he fell out of the rotation Then Lebron James owned us The end ,-1
Lebron james is just something else,0
He was LeBron James in that Finals he is now GOAT,0
Yeah but the issue becomes was it an actual loan or did someone give him the car because hes LeBron James kicked an investigation that turned up nothing  httpswwwnytimescom20030114sportsbasketballlebronjamesssuvpromptsaninvestigationhtml,0
I was told I needed an education and shit when I could just go out and be LeBron James smh,-1
This is an interesting thing you could learn in life When you get pushed down you get the fuck back up and become Lebron James Easy No but seriously its interesting that he took that loss and got better,1
Coming from rall can someone explain I guess it has something to do with LeBron James and Toronto,0
So I cam from All just wondering the context here Guessing LeBronto refers to Lebron James but are they just saying he is tall Is there a backstory,0
Yeah because hes not the next LeBron James Lets just slow our roll right there,1
LeBron James plays for Cleveland who are playing Toronto in the playoffs LeBrons team has knocked them out of the playoffs two years in a row and its looking like they will do it again this year Calling it LeBronto is basically saying that LeBron owns their team ,1
Alright after tonight I have officially converted LeBron James is the greatest basketball player of all time I have never seen such a dad dicking in my life ,1
according to the first result on google there are at least 1000 lebrons in the world and none of them are as good as lebron james so i would have to conclude that his name has no effect on his greatness and that he would be just as good if his name was cornelius or something ,1
At what point do the Raptors call Lebron James their daddy,0
James Jones We all know LeBron and James Jones are the same persondont contradict it,-1
The answer is Lebron James ,0
Micheal Jordan has Lebron James posters in his room ,0
Chuck I GUARANTEEEE LEBRON JAMES WONT LEAVE CLEVELAND,0
What if his name was James James  Would we take James James as seriously as LeBron James,0
nah goat means greatest to play the game Thats the man right there Lebron James ,1
No no  LeBron James,-1
See theres the issue You cant call something undeniable and then have it be easily deniable I think Michael Jordan is a better basketball player than LeBron James I just denied your claim Is there any proof No and there never EVER will be Its called an opinion they tend to differ ,0
Newsflash Ben Simmons and LeBron James are not the same player,0

Im more impressed by Scarrence Terrence because I already know Lebron James is the best player on this planet lol,1
Yep definitely dont need to show up against LeBron James in the finals no siree,1

If youve got lebron james you rely on lebron james,0
In other words if you took the current favorite for MVP off of his team it would be a closer representation to replace him with a replacementlevel player than with LeBron James,1
Ben and Jerrys LeBron James flavor LeBron and James flavored ice cream swirled together with James dough LeBron bits and LeBron James CORE,0
Um Lebron James is how Lebron James in 2014 was really fucking good ,1
He isnt THAT bad and he seems to be better in the postseason He gets a lot of shit for relying on LeBron james too much but I mean what else are you gonna do when you have talent like that surrounded by lesser players ,1
No you cant just throw bodies at a guy like Jordan because hed just pass to a wide open pippen kukoc or HarperKerr   Its why we dont see players double and triple teaming Lebron James every single play of a game ,1
I still cant believe that scrub made it to the NBA had a solid career and is now coaching LeBron muthafkng James  Im sure he cant believe it either which explains the look on his face most of the time,1
Every team in the East is one all star away from taking the East  Just so happens that that all star is LeBron James  ,0
I can almost guarantee if the Cavs make the Finals they wont get swept I mean did the Warriors sweep the Pellies Did the Rockets sweep the Wolves or Jazz Nope But both teams will sweep a far superior team in the Cavs than the JazzPels and Wolves With LeBron James at his peak right now ,1
Wrong again friend LeBron James is in fact not my father,0
I know how tall he is Im saying that calling him a high IQ IT is a terrible comparison  Thats like equating Lebron James physique to that of Kirk Hinrich,0
The problem is not as difficult as people think this raptor team has no one as good as LeBron James ,0
 Never thought LeBron James would had insane performance in this off season,-1
Lebron james,0
Lebron James being on the paper makes the Cavs better on paper Hes such a fucking mismatch its insane Absolutely no way to stop him thats the Raptors problem their defense on Lebron ,-1
Hes a poor mans LeBron James And even then that poor man would be pretty damn wealthy   He does everything on the court and orchestrates that warriors offense He just isnt as good offensively and maybe a bit less court vision but he makes that teams offense run ,-1
Ah refreshing to see A first player ever to that doesnt finish with LeBron James at the end,0

The east was already fucked Lebron James 6 at the time straight finals Youre not complaining about that are you It was already not competitive Only the West was competitive,-1
LeBron James tho,0
Why are Lakers fans making selfrighteous posts about their team in the midst of this trade  Yall just got LeBron James you have 16 rings why do you feel the need to make these posts lol,1
Nah dude Laker fans are SO salty Every single one Its not like we got Lebron James Remember they cant go with the slant that Lakers cant sign anyone so they focus on Paul George who clearly had his mind made up weeks ago and didnt meet with any teams,0
The precedent is that you wont just struggle with no free agency signings youll struggle with keeping players in Toronto as well as keeping fans You cant trade a guy that important to the franchise in a shitty way even if he had a bad playoffs considering it was against LeBron fucking James,0

Because James Worthy was a small forward and the Lakers already have LeBron at power forward I did say they could slide LeBron to PF and play either Worthy or Elgin Baylor at SF,1
If Magic or Pelinka have any resemblance of a backbone as Pat Riley to put LeBron in his place and allow Luke Walton to run his system then it would be really nice to have variety to our current prolific offense aka PnR and Iso three top of the key that is being freelanced by LeBron James ,1
I dont think CP3 really gives a shit about a championship The guy wanted to get paid Otherwise he probably would have taken a paycut to go play with Kawhi and LMA on the Spurs or play with LeBron James on the Cavs when he had the chance ,1

Ever since Lebron James that shit has gone back to 5th grade does it go earlier now That seems too crazy even with how far the goal posts have shifted,-1
This probably shouldnt be considered a slight  its just James being James  Translation This is a slight but its LeBron so were going to let him do it anyway with no repercussions In fact if the team fails itll be Walton who gets all of the blame,-1

Lets be honest the only guy truly putting in the hard work dayin and dayout without fail on either team is LeBron James Everyone else is just coasting on pure talent and dont put in the tireless effort off the court  LeBron takes his talent and maximizes it,1
Add LeBron to Atlanta and they already have a good chance to win the chip Its LeBron James bruh ,1

Magic Johnson  Kobe Bryant  Kevin Durant  LeBron James  Kareem   these guys will put up a challenge,0
Lebron James lol,1
LeBron James absolutely believed he could beat the Raptors in the series dont be ridiculous He probably didnt expect to take game 1 but hes won plenty of series after dropping the first game,1
What kinda logic is this So because Terry Porter and Lebron James who are on completely different ends of the talent spectrum did it Ben Simmons will also do it While ignoring all these shitty NBA players,-1
Nah  Raptors arent even playing awful LeBron James is just who he is,0
He started in OGs place early in the season and struggled Went down with an injury for a couple games and OG claimed his spot as the starter The bench mob VanVleet Wright Miles Siakam Poeltl lineup was born and he fell out of the rotation Then Lebron James owned us The end ,-1
Lebron james is just something else,0
He was LeBron James in that Finals he is now GOAT,0
Yeah but the issue becomes was it an actual loan or did someone give him the car because hes LeBron James kicked an investigation that turned up nothing  httpswwwnytimescom20030114sportsbasketballlebronjamesssuvpromptsaninvestigationhtml,0
I was told I needed an education and shit when I could just go out and be LeBron James smh,-1
This is an interesting thing you could learn in life When you get pushed down you get the fuck back up and become Lebron James Easy No but seriously its interesting that he took that loss and got better,1
Coming from rall can someone explain I guess it has something to do with LeBron James and Toronto,0
So I cam from All just wondering the context here Guessing LeBronto refers to Lebron James but are they just saying he is tall Is there a backstory,0
Yeah because hes not the next LeBron James Lets just slow our roll right there,1
LeBron James plays for Cleveland who are playing Toronto in the playoffs LeBrons team has knocked them out of the playoffs two years in a row and its looking like they will do it again this year Calling it LeBronto is basically saying that LeBron owns their team ,1
Alright after tonight I have officially converted LeBron James is the greatest basketball player of all time I have never seen such a dad dicking in my life ,1
according to the first result on google there are at least 1000 lebrons in the world and none of them are as good as lebron james so i would have to conclude that his name has no effect on his greatness and that he would be just as good if his name was cornelius or something ,1
At what point do the Raptors call Lebron James their daddy,0
James Jones We all know LeBron and James Jones are the same persondont contradict it,-1
The answer is Lebron James ,0

Um Lebron James is how Lebron James in 2014 was really fucking good ,1
He isnt THAT bad and he seems to be better in the postseason He gets a lot of shit for relying on LeBron james too much but I mean what else are you gonna do when you have talent like that surrounded by lesser players ,1
No you cant just throw bodies at a guy like Jordan because hed just pass to a wide open pippen kukoc or HarperKerr   Its why we dont see players double and triple teaming Lebron James every single play of a game ,1
I still cant believe that scrub made it to the NBA had a solid career and is now coaching LeBron muthafkng James  Im sure he cant believe it either which explains the look on his face most of the time,1
Every team in the East is one all star away from taking the East  Just so happens that that all star is LeBron James  ,0
I can almost guarantee if the Cavs make the Finals they wont get swept I mean did the Warriors sweep the Pellies Did the Rockets sweep the Wolves or Jazz Nope But both teams will sweep a far superior team in the Cavs than the JazzPels and Wolves With LeBron James at his peak right now ,1
Wrong again friend LeBron James is in fact not my father,0
I know how tall he is Im saying that calling him a high IQ IT is a terrible comparison  Thats like equating Lebron James physique to that of Kirk Hinrich,0
The problem is not as difficult as people think this raptor team has no one as good as LeBron James ,0
 Never thought LeBron James would had insane performance in this off season,-1
Lebron james,0
Lebron James being on the paper makes the Cavs better on paper Hes such a fucking mismatch its insane Absolutely no way to stop him thats the Raptors problem their defense on Lebron ,-1
Hes a poor mans LeBron James And even then that poor man would be pretty damn wealthy   He does everything on the court and orchestrates that warriors offense He just isnt as good offensively and maybe a bit less court vision but he makes that teams offense run ,-1
Ah refreshing to see A first player ever to that doesnt finish with LeBron James at the end,0

G Michael Jordan F LeBron James C Shaquille ONeal   VS   PG Whitey Kachan SG Johnny Jorgenson SF Phil Farbman PF Earl Gardner  C Oliver Miller ,0
And the Lakers dont have a Irving or Wade to take advantage of the single coverage while James is being denied the ball  Im pretty sure LeBron will have to one man army this team into the postseason Not good enough to allow him to lessen his burden,0
Ummm Lebron James ,0
Tatum KAT Kawhi only because we havent seen him play in like a year and Lebron James Jr yes im calling a young child overrated I absolutely went there,1
Thats true but atleast the sixers had a clear plan The lakers where just fucking up and walked into LeBron James ,1
Hes a mid 30s 3 point shooter   And if you take the ball out of lebrons hand on offense you give up LeBron James biggest asset ,1
Magic Johnson  Pete Maravich  LeBron James  Chris Webber  Nikola Jokic,0

Why would it just have LeBron James name on it Does the bag have LeBron James on it Nike just has their logo and oh by the way LeBron James,0
Oh this is rich coming from a Laker fan It must suck knowing that it took Lebron James to make your franchise relevant again because your young core obviously couldnt get it done but hey good luck this year,1
