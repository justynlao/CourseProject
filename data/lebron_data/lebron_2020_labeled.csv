and after all that his worst call was still a 5 second back to the basket violation on lebron james in the 2011 finals  that has never been called in the PLAYOFFS in NBA history only gets called about once every 100 regular season games  and he called it in the 4th quarter of game 5 i think,-1

Kawhi LeBron Scottie Pippen James Leonard,0
I also do not claim to see the game better than a pro NBA coach What the response was about was whether I think a LeBron James power play for more Rondo minutes was more likely than a coach being headstrong about a PG who runs his system well,1
They said it was included in a post but the post itself was about Kawhi going 417 with mention of the zero points at the bottom  LeBron James had his very own post about having zero points in the fourth hit the frontpage yesterday but I digress,0

The obvious and truest choice is LeBron Assist leader James Kawhi is top 5 for sure but to definitively put him above LeBron seems silly LeBrons team is higher seeded won two series in 5 in a row and he also happened to lead the league in assists this season,1
He was ahead of Steph Curry Kevin Durant Lebron James Kawhi Leonard Would you say that hes better than any of those players,1

Giannis Antetokounmpo LeBron James Anthony Davis Kawhi Leonard Kevin Durant Steph Curry and James Harden I think hes on par with Luka Doncic and Damien Lillard just outside the top 5,1
Eh there was a very slim chance it doesnt work There was much better chance that adding arguably TOP 5 player in the league to fucking LeBron James will make Lakers win The rebuild also let Lakers build a team to suit LeBrons play more add shooters etc,1
Hes a guard who cant shoot well or play make exceptionally well Hes a good defender but that alone wont cut it on a team without LeBron James,1

Well one things for sure only one player on the court tonight deserves to be compared against LeBron James And it aint Kawhi,1
The fact that they ran into Warriors and Lebron James means that the only way they can get better is with more star power Also Westbrook and Harden pairing is not ideal Harden cannot work with a guy who cannot shoot to save his life,0
Kinda bs imo Hes been pretty good Sorry he couldnt beat the Steph Curry led Warriors and now the Lebron James led Lakers No other coach would be able to make this happen,1

When they do finally play their next game I swear Lebron James is going to pop off and hit like 60 points,1
Lakers are definitely 10000000 winning it all this year and Lebron James is going to put up some absolutely ridiculous numbers the rest of the way and in the playoffs,1

It was a mistake with the footage Even if whoever takes care of choosing the clips doesnt know what Lebron and Kobe look like Im sure theyre able to read James all over Lebrons jersey in the footage Unfortunate sure but lets not reach here,1
gtI said this on draft night but if he avoids injuries hes gonna be a mvp level player in the nba  DAMN Really going out on a limb with this prediction Predicting the most hyped player since Lebron James will be an MVP level player is a crazy prediction,-1
LeBron James,0
And its James Worthy with the slam excuse me LeBron James,0
Now theyre saying its LeBron James,0
That didnt happen they asked Lebron before the interview and he said they could ask about it httpswwwgooglecomampswwwwashingtonpostcomnewsearlyleadwp20180418tntblastedforaskinglebronjamesforreactiontodeathofgreggpopovichswife3foutputTypeamp,0

Damn including his daughter and another kiddo RIP to the Black Mamba and the others    Also my gf just realized Kobe Bryant and LeBron James are entirely 2 different people,-1
Lakers were on a plane from Philadelphia they just landed at LAX You know LeBron James is going to want to do something big as a tribute not just a passing tweet,0
I dont watch basketball at all and maybe only know 4 players Micheal Jordan LeBron James Curry And Kobe Bryant and he is one of them and that says enough,0
This is terrible Even crazier that his all time score record was beat only yesterday by LeBron James,-1

The last basketball game he ever watched was between his hometown Sixers and the team he played for his entire career where he was passed by Lebron James in career points  Life is weird and cruel,-1
Ok hes literally as sculpted as LeBron james youre fucking right my guy,1
I wonder how Lebron is holding up right now given his last post dedicated to James,1
Prime Dwight beat Lebron James on the finals conference  Id take Current Dwight over Prime boogie not even lying,1
I have a hard time feeling bad for the Mavericks when they have a 20 year old Lebron James on their team,-1
I cant believe it The day after Lebron James surpassing him in the scoring record and the message Lebron put on his shoes so eerie,-1
Essentially the best player that was the bridge from Michael Jordan and LeBron James LeBron has actually just passed Kobe for 3rd in all time scoring last night,1
LeBron James  Not because of his character but because we found out LeBron seems like the type of guy who would  that under wraps,1
No I meant the extension he gave Iguodala  Its 15m for 2021 season and another 15m team option for 2122 Why the fuck would he extend a guy who just arrived on a trade but isnt named Lebron James or Dwyane Wade,-1
Everyone is making their pick on who the most famous player will be but I dont think it will be anyone currently in the NBA  Lebron still has a few more years left and will be the face until he retires  In a few years someone will come in hyped as the next Lebron James and he will take off,0
Someone trying to compare LeBron James to Bob Cousy Literally impossible comparison,0
LeBron James will never surpass Kobe Bryant RIP because he has never won the dunk contest,-1
They drafted way better than Cavs who got 3 god damn 1st round picks in 4 years They became relevant and won a championship purely because Cleveland happens to be the hometown of some guy named Lebron James,1
Dude His name Lebron literally means King His name is King James lol its not a nickname,1
Lebron started calling himself king james in high school and everyone ran with it,0
and lebron james becomes the first player in NBA history to win two NBA championships against two team with regular season record records,1
But he didnt have any choice This guy was one of the first to even be throwing behind the back passes This is part of the reason why comparing players in the 60s to the 2000s is completely wrong You cant compare Bob Cousy to LeBron James It is impossible,-1
Daryl Morey  China  Lebron James  Response to Moreys comments regarding China  The person you responded to said politics is a fuckin shit show so while the above examples dont exactly translate to China I think theyre examples of politics being a fuckin shit show,-1
Thats certainly more stacked if you look at the pure stats but I wouldnt bet against a team with both LeBron James and Steph Curry on it,0

As much as i would like to see a starting lineup of Steph Curry James Harden LeBron James Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis i hope Bron skips it to rest,1
Small anecdote but I think most people can reiterate this  If I go next door to the office that has eight women all over 40 and ask them if they know LeBron James theyre all going to say yes If I ask them about Giannis theyll most likely have no idea who Im talking about,0
My ideal squad right now before injuries and drop outs  C Anthony Davis  Bam Adebayo PF LeBron James  Paul George  Draymond Green SF Kevin Durant  Klay Thompson SG Kawhi Leonard  James Harden  PG Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Damian Lillard,1
Maybe because Kyrie has a history of saying dumb shit and he has nowhere near the clout as Lebron fucking James One is the greatest player of his era The other thinks dinosaurs are fake Maybe instead of calling teammates out by name he should work on not being so socially inept,-1
lol Booker would literally have to be LeBron James,1

I feel like Luka is more of a LeBron James Harden type LeBron like in the playmaking and team leading but offensively very Harden like,0
On this sub specifically many people claim hes already better than James Harden and even some keep on mentioning how he will be GOAT over MJ  Lukas a great player and has potential but we should wait to see how he does in playoffs before we start comparing him to LeBron and MJ,1
LeBron Steph Curry Kevin Durant James Harden Russel Westbrook Carmelo Anthony Kyrie Irving Anthony Davis are all more famous in America than Luka or Giannis,0

In the most important games you can actually expect LeBron to play all 48 Hell it was just two years ago where Old James was doing 45 just for his team to survive Thats what it takes sometimes to get to the finals and win some chips You gotta be hungry and put your body on the line,1
Nailed it If LeBron didnt collapse in that finals Flash would have four chips and two fmvps and it would be a little harder to relegate him as someone who needed Bron Not discounting James either he was lights out against Chicago that year,1
they definitely wont retire it based on hes LeBron James  it will take rings,1

Eh there was a very slim chance it doesnt work There was much better chance that adding arguably TOP 5 player in the league to fucking LeBron James will make Lakers win The rebuild also let Lakers build a team to suit LeBrons play more add shooters etc,1
Hes a guard who cant shoot well or play make exceptionally well Hes a good defender but that alone wont cut it on a team without LeBron James,1

Well one things for sure only one player on the court tonight deserves to be compared against LeBron James And it aint Kawhi,1
The fact that they ran into Warriors and Lebron James means that the only way they can get better is with more star power Also Westbrook and Harden pairing is not ideal Harden cannot work with a guy who cannot shoot to save his life,0

To be honest 07 Cavs shouldnt even have been there  It would be a better match up between Pistons vs Spurs in terms of casts experiences and coaches The only variable was LeBron James who just couldnt let it go and used all of his energy on that historical  ECF 7 games,1
He didnt really do anything wrong outside of maybe 2018 because the Raptors werent gonna succeed as long as LeBron was there Them getting swept in 2018 could be put on DeMar a bit but its really not his fault his team kept matching up with LeBron fucking James,0
